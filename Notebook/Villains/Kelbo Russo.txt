He is portrayed by [[Jeff Garlin]]. He appeared in three episodes, one in season one, one in season two, and one in season three. He still has his powers and turns into [[Shakira]] in one of his episodes.\u00a0After Jerry won his family's wizard test, he gave his powers to Kelbo, because Jerry wanted to get married to a mortal. Kelbo's first appearance was in \"[[Alex in the Middle]]\" and later \"[[Retest]].\"\n\n==Personality==\nKelbo is a fun-loving guy who uses magic to enjoy himself and do practically everything Jerry tells his kids not to do. However, when it comes to using his powers in a serious situation, Kelbo is somewhat lacking due to his inexperience and lack of ability to focus. In fact, it is apparent that he was actually the worst wizard out of Jerry, Megan, and himself. However, Jerry chose to let him keep the power because, for as bad as he is at magic, Kelbo lacks any non-magical skills; meaning that his life would have been far worse without them, as compared to his brother who set up his own business, and his sister who is a talented painter.\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nKelboR.jpg|Kelbo in his [[Shakira]] costume.\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Russo, Kelbo}}\n{{Wizards of Waverly Place}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Wizards of Waverly Place Characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Italian characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Males]]"
