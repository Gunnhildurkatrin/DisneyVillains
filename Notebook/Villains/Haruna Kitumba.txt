He is a friend of [[Miles Callisto]] and used to be his neighbors with him before Miles and his family went into outer space. Later in the series, he becomes a member of [[Mission Force One]].\n\n==Background==\nWhen Miles was still living on Earth, Haruna was his next-door neighbor and they were the best of friends. They use to hang out together and go skateboarding. Even when Miles and his family left to explore the universe, the two boys remained good friends and stayed in contact but at the same time, they missed hanging out with each other.\n\nIn his debut appearance, \"[[To the Goldilocks Zone]]\", Haruna and his family were moving into outer space to start a human colony on a planet called Malvowlio. Sadly, his new home was destroyed by a Protoplanet which collided into Malvowlio before Haruna and his family could arrive. However, with help from their old neighbors, the Callistos, they were able to find another planet that was suitable for human life.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Like Miles, Haruna's favorite activity is skateboarding/blastboarding.\n*As of Mission Force One, Sly, his Robo-Dog, has been upgraded to resemble the type used by the Space Guard.\n*Like all of Mission Force One, he had a hair makeover, he went from his fuzzy, long, messy hair to straight, short hair.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nTo-the-Goldilocks-Zone-1.png\nTo-the-Goldilocks-Zone-2.png\nTo-the-Goldilocks-Zone-9.png\nTo-the-Goldilocks-Zone-12.png\nTo-the-Goldilocks-Zone-15.png\nTo-the-Goldilocks-Zone-17.png\nTo-the-Goldilocks-Zone-19.png\nTo-the-Goldilocks-Zone-23.png\nTo-the-Goldilocks-Zone-27.png\nScavengers of Mars 1.jpg\nThe-Quantum-Cup-2.png\nThe-Quantum-Cup-1.png\nTeam Exo-Flex 1.jpg\nThe Tiny Aliens 1.jpg\nThe First Day of Galactic School 3.jpg\nBuilding Day 1.jpg\nOnce in a Blue Moon 2.jpg\nConnect and Protect 4.png\nThe Great Space Train Robbery-Mission Pets One 1.jpg\nVillain After Villain 1.jpg\nMFO Hoverbikes.png\nMiles, Loretta, Haruna and Mirandos in Gi Guit.jpg\nThe Space Station Situation 11.jpg\nAggro Jam 1.png\nThe Nemesystems Takeover 1.png\nMission Force One.png\nMission Force One poster.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Miles from Tomorrowland}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kitumba, Haruna}}\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Miles from Tomorrowland characters]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Scouts]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]"
