When [[Paul (Inner Workings)|Paul]] stops to eat breakfast at a caf\u00e9, his brain tells him that he might order a heavy breakfast which could be a bad idea. Paul then tries to buy sunglasses from a [[Kate (Inner Workings)|vendor]] and get into water just like a surfer in which his brain tells him it might be a bad idea. On his way to the office, Paul's brain and heart get into an argument, embarrassing three nearby seniors thinking that Paul is embarrassing them, albeit him having an argument with his heart. When Paul goes to work, he becomes miserable. He then notices that he starts to become miserable just like the colleague next to Paul. Paul's brain and heart suddenly get along during lunchtime as he decides to become more spontaneous in the things he did not want to do at first such as eating caf\u00e9 breakfast, trying in a pair of sunglasses from the vendor, and getting into the water, making him relieved.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nInner Workings 1.jpg\nInner Workings Brain plush.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Brain}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
