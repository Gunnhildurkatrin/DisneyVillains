When the Raider dies during a mission, [[Organization (PKNA)|the Organization]] adopts him to train him as the Raider's replacement, known as the Griffon. The Griffon blames [[the Duck Avenger]] for his father's death and uses time travel to manipulate events and cause the Avenger to become an outlaw and the Organization to handle control of the temporal flow. [[Uno|Odin Eidolon]] brings Trip from a previous point of his timeline and puts him on the Duck Avenger's care. The Duck Avenger and Trip are hunted by the Gryphon and [[Newton (PKNA)|Newton]], until the Raider appears revealing that he left his mission when he found Trip was gone (therefore changing the whole event of his death). Trip happily hugs his father and tells the Gryphon \"I'll never be like you!\" which undoes the Gryphon's existence and all the changes he made to the timeline.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nTrip & The Raider.jpg|Trip and his father.\nRaider, Trip and Washington.jpg\nGryphon &amp; Trip.jpg|Trip and his evil adult self, the Gryphon.\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{PKNA}}\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Chickens]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
