"\n[[File:Barry_Barnes.jpg|thumb]]'''Barry Barnes''' is [[Bennett James]]' editor and boss responsible for publishing his books. He's portrayed by Randy J. Goodwin.\n\n==Character History==\nBarry Barnes is the editor and publisher. Barry is also Bennett's boss who publishes his books.\n\n==History==\nBarry was in his office when he receives a phone call from Stan (unknown to him he is talking to a dog). The phone call was only made because Stan and the kids thought Bennett sent him his hard drive, which initially carried Stan's blog. And now, they try to convince him to not publish it yet. During the conversation, Stan told Barry he needed to focus, to which Barry tells his assistant Marcus to remind him to focus. Stan says hurtful things to Barry, which push him to fire Bennett after he picks up the phone and becomes disappointed about it.\n\nRealizing that Bennett never sent Barry the hard drive of Stan's blog, Stan and the kids try to find a way to fix their mistake. Stan decides to talk to him personally even if it means giving up his secret to the world.\n\nThe next day, Barry (who is blindfolded) is approached by Stan in his office and he tells Barry he should hire Bennett back because he is not doing well. The kids realize he could be making a big mistake by what he's doing when they find him with Barry. The kids talk to Stan and unknown to them, Barry listens to their conversation about being a family, where Barry cuts in every time saying he knows what it feels like being there. After they finish, Barry has a change of heart and hires Bennett back so his book can be published.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Barry Barnes publishing Bennett's books is where the James-Jennings' family get their money.\n*Barry Barnes was the first person that Stan was about to risk his secret into getting him to hire Bennett back. However, it failed as though he could hear him, he couldn't see because he had an eyelid rejuvenation.\n*It turns out, Barry does care about Bennett, as he is one of his writers who still goes to lunch with him.\n\n{{Dog With a Blog}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Barnes, Barry}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Dog with a Blog characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
