A student at Middleburg Central High, he also works daily as a part-time hero.\n\n==Background==\nPenn Zero obtained the job as part-time hero when his parents, [[Brock and Vonnie Zero]], found themselves trapped in the \"Most Dangerous World Imaginable\", with no way to escape but enough experience to stay alive. From then on, he lived with his [[Aunt Rose and Uncle Chuck]], and could communicate with his parents via the Multi Universe Hologram Uplink (MUHU). As a part-time hero working for [[Phyllis]], he is joined by his best school friends [[Boone]] and [[Sashi Kobayashi|Sashi]] to hop through dimensions using the Multi Universe Transprojector to foil the plans of his art teacher [[Rippen]] and the [[Principal Larry]].\n\n===Physical Appearance===\nPenn is middling in height, with curly red hair and cyan eyes. He wears a white-with-black-sleeves shirt with a white slashed zero outlined with orange on the front, a blue plaid collar and end of sleeves, and fake chain mail mesh underneath. Around his hips, he wears a black belt with the MUHU attached to it. He also wears red skinny jeans and boots with black fronts, white backs, and a yellow line above the ankle.\n\n==Relationships==\n===[[Sashi Kobayashi|Sashi]]===\nCalling her the smartest and toughest of girls, Penn appreciates Sashi's friendship and assistance. He relies on Sashi heavily when it comes to pulling off complicated tasks like retrieving the magic sword and escaping the prison cage in \"[[North Pole Down]]\". Whenever Sashi's being more aggressive, Penn is terrified by her, like when she wasn't pleased with his trick in dodgeball in \"[[3 Big Problems]]\", but at other times he enjoys making fun of her like when she gets a silly form or he's not fazed by it. He calls her out for being so violent, stubborn, and a bit crazy in \"The Princess Most Fair\", but when she admits she feels left out of Penn and Boone's close bond, he reassures her that she is the glue to the group, keeping the team on the rails.\n\n===[[Maria (Penn Zero: Part-Time Hero)|Maria]]===\nIn \"[[The Pirates, the Parrot, the Puzzles and the Talking Boats]]\", He has a crush on the female pirate named Maria.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Penn sleeps with a teddy bear, as revealed in \"[[The Princess Most Fair]]\".\n*In \"[[The Old Old West]]\", Penn is shown to be able to fix his scooter while talking to his parents.\n*In \"[[I'm Super!]]\", Penn reveals that he had always wanted to be a superhero since he was six years old.\n**It is also his favorite dimension.\n*It's revealed that in \"[[The Ripple Effect]]\", his family has never failed a single mission, hence why their last name is Zero.\n*As shown in \"[[Rip-Penn]]\", whenever he loses his patience, he loses his temper as well.\n**Also in the same episode, it's revealed that he is afraid of sock puppets and dying (with the latter being developed after nearly dying in \"[[Totally into Your Body]]\").\n*Penn has thanatophobia, the fear of death.\n*In \"[[Lady Starblaster]]\", it's revealed that Penn is a talented dancer. Also another [[Disney XD]] character is [[Ferb Fletcher]] from ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]''. Both are talented dancers.\n*In \"[[Zap One]]\", it's revealed that he initially wore a teal sweater before he had his trademark shirt and fake chain mail mesh, which were gifts that he found from his parents after his first mission. Moreover, his MUHU was also a gift from them.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nPenn Zero.jpg\nPenn Zero poster.jpg\nPenn Knight.png\nPenn Santa.png\nPenn PJs.png\nPenn as Aladan.png\nPenn expired milk.png\nPenn Cowboy.png\nPenn Merman.png\nPenn stuffed rabbit.png\nPenn Track Uniform.png\nPenn Super Super.png\nPenn Green People.png\nPenn Brainz burger employee.png\nPenn as Admiral.png\nPenn as Goobert.png\nPenn Jones.png\nPenn as the mask archer.png\nPenn the Actor.png\nPenn as a Monster.png\nPenn as a Choco trunk.png\nvlcsnap-2015-03-31-15h15m40s625.png\nPenn a Female Princess.png\nPenn the Monster Hunter.png\nPenn Hue.png\nPatient Penn.png\nRenegade (penn).png\nDr. Penn.png\npenn wearing tights.png\nSuper Spy Penn Zero.png\nPenn Rabbit Barbarian.png\nDetective Penn.png\nDisney XD Hero Trip - Penn Zero.png|Penn Zero as he appears in the Disney XD game [[Disney XD Hero Trip|Hero Trip]]\nPirate Penn.png\nPenn the Mouse.png\nPenn Wrestler Fairy.png\nPenn Automaton.png\nPenn's Ghost.png\nKing Papyron Penn.png\nPenn Peaceful Villager.png\nPenn Zero Clown.jpg\ntumblr inline ns05fq70rL1rij3cw 1280.jpg\n59d.jpg\n486009848.jpg\nPenn Zero Robot.jpg\n486009876.jpg\nAnime Penn Zero.jpg\nMr. Wright.jpg\nPenn and Sashi kiss.jpeg|Penn and Sashi share their first kiss in the series finale, \"At the End of the Worlds\"\nPenn Training Suit.png\nPenn Mech.png\nPenn ill.png\nLady Starblaster - Dancing Penn.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Penn Zero: Part-Time Hero}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Zero, Penn}}\n[[nl:Penn Zero]]\n[[pt-br:Penn Zero]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Penn Zero: Part-Time Hero characters]]\n[[Category:Cowboys & cowgirls]]\n[[Category:Mermen]]\n[[Category:Clowns]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Superheroes]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Elephants]]\n\n[[Category:Police officers]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Dragons]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Plants]]\n[[Category:Rabbits]]\n[[Category:Detectives]]\n[[Category:Toys]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Warriors]]\n[[Category:Dancers]]\n[[Category:Shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Fairies]]\n[[Category:Mice]]\n[[Category:Spirits]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Soldiers]]\n[[Category:Time travelers]]\n[[Category:Martial Artists]]\n[[Category:Knights]]\n[[Category:Archers]]\n[[Category:Wrestlers]]\n[[Category:Nephews]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Captains]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
