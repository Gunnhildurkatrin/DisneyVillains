She is an 8-year-old girl who seems to be the daughter of [[Joe Kingman]], a firm but incredible football player.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nPeyton is a cute little girl with a sweet nature. She is not likely to pester Joe, and likes stuff that girls normally like: ponies, candy, the [[Disney Channel]], ballet and dazzling jewels on their clothes. He is often firm to her when he thinks she is pestering him or just being curious. She also likes cookies, but he does not, because when he tries one, he is disgusted when he hears that she has put cinnamon in them, unaware that he was allergic to it.\n\n===Physical Appearance===\nPeyton is small and slender with fair skin and curly brown hair. She is usually seen in a pink leotard and tutu when she has ballet classes. She even has her doll, Camille, dressed in jewels from her Bedazzler.\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kelly, Peyton}}\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:The Game Plan characters]]\n[[Category:Deuteragonists]]\n[[Category:Ballerinas]]\n[[Category:Students]]"
