But when Baloo brings the doctor (along with [[Kit Cloudkicker|Kit]] and [[Wildcat]]) back to the flight school, it is completely deserted.\n\nDoctor Cooper starts to grow impatient until he hears Baloo mention Magee's name. The doctor says the airfield hasn't been used since the entrance was almost completely blocked by a landslide. Cooper explains that Joe Magee injured his leg saving fellow pilots from a burning plane. The injured leg left Magee unable to fly again, and sometime after, built the flying school and trained a number of the best pilots.\n\nFinally, the doctor tells Baloo that Magee had passed away twenty years ago.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Cooper's voice actor was [[Alan Young]], who was best known for voicing [[Scrooge McDuck]] from [[1974]] until his death in [[2016]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nDoc Cooper 001.jpg\nThe-Old-Man-and-the-Sea-Duck-58.png\nDoc Cooper 003.jpg\nDoc Cooper 004.jpg|\"Have you got an injured man here or not?\"\nDoc Cooper 006.jpg|\"Joe Magee?\"\nDoc Cooper 007.jpg\nDoc Cooper 013.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{TaleSpin}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cooper}}\n[[Category:TaleSpin characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Turtles]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
