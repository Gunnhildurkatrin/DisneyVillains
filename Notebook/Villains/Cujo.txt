It is shown that he dislikes eating broccoli, to which according to Milo's mother, broccoli is unhealthy to him.\n\n==Role in the film==\nAfter Milo refuses to finish eating his broccoli during dinner time just as Milo's mother refuses to let Milo watch TV until he finishes his broccoli, Milo then decides to \"finish\" all the broccoli by giving the broccoli to Cujo, causing the cat to not feel good after eating it, much to his mother's disgust. Milo's mother is upset with her son for lying to her and giving Cujo something the cat shouldn't eat just as he argues with her. As punishment, she sends Milo to bed for disobeying her.\n\nCujo then later appears in Milo's bedroom, telling the cat that he needs to apologize to his mother for disobeying her. Milo only finds out that his mother is being abducted by [[Martians]]. Cujo is not seen afterwards.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Cujo is named after the titular antagonistic dog from the novel of the same name by Stephen King, only the character is a cat instead of a dog. The exception is that dogs and cats in real life have several relationships which can be either aggressive or helpful.\n[[Category:Mars Needs Moms characters]]\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
