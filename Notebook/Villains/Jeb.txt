He hates it when anyone touches his tin cans that he gnaws on and then saves as part of his can collection. He is very rude to his fellow farm animals and has a tendency to speak out when he shouldn't. He is also averse to sharing his barrel with anyone.\n\nHowever,\u00a0Jeb later shows that he has\u00a0a good heart when he\u00a0becomes concerned about the [[Little Patch of Heaven (farm)|farm]] looking\u00a0bleak during a\u00a0rainstorm. He shows his good side\u00a0even more when he is the first animal to call out an attack on [[Alameda Slim|Slim]] when he pulls out a pistol\u00a0to shoot the cows.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Home on the Range]]''===\nJeb is first seen during the \"[[Little Patch of Heaven]]\" music number eating falling apples that [[Grace]] gathers from an apple tree. He later clashes with\u00a0[[Ollie]]'s [[piggies]] when they attempt to retrieve a can from him (which he stole) that they were playing with. [[Mrs. Calloway]] breaks up the fight and reprimands Jeb, although the old goat shows no remorse. When\u00a0Calloway then asks Jeb if he already has enough cans of his own, the old goat denies it, despite having an enormous stockpile of chewed tin cans right next to his barrel he sleeps in.\n\nWhen [[Maggie]] later arrives on the farm, Jeb glares at her with suspicion. Mrs. Calloway attempts to politely welcome Maggie to Little Patch of Heaven, but Jeb coughs loudly and calls her a phony, so\u00a0Calloway stuffs a tin can over Jeb's muzzle to silence him. Maggie later plays with one of Jeb's cans against his wishes, as he claims it to be \"a family heirloom.\"\n\nLater, when [[Pearl Gesner|Pearl]]'s livestock face losing their\u00a0farm due to a bank notice that she hasn't been able to pay yet, Jeb and the other farm animals become distraught. Meanwhile, Maggie, Mrs. Calloway, and Grace go on a quest to capture outlaw Alameda Slim\u00a0and use the reward money to save Little Patch of Heaven.\n\nAfter some time passes, Jeb believes that the cows will never return and all is lost. Ollie tries to lighten things up by telling Jeb how Mrs. Calloway once helped him get his head out of a spittoon, to which Jeb snappishly tells Ollie to get off his case. However, he later shows a little compassion by saying, \"Well, whatever it is they're doing, they'd better do it soon.\"\n\nIn the film's climax, Jeb helps the three cows (who have returned from their journey) battle a disguised Alameda Slim after he attempts to kill the bovines by throwing countless tin cans at him. Jeb and the farm animals succeed in defeating Slim, who is then arrested by [[Sheriff Sam Brown]]. After Pearl uses the reward money to pay the bank's\u00a0debt for Little Patch of Heaven, a photographer takes a picture of Pearl and her livestock, with everyone smiling save Jeb. It then gets posted in the papers.\u00a0\n\nJeb is last seen with [[Lucky Jack]],\u00a0who moved into the farm and became his new roommate. Jeb chews up the article that Lucky Jack was reading before he could finish. Lucky Jack scolds Jeb for chewing the paper, and Jeb tries to force Lucky Jack out of his barrel. The two then start fighting, causing the barrel they live in to roll around. Later, the barrel with Jeb, Lucky Jack, and\u00a0[[Rusty (Home on the Range)|Rusty]]\u00a0falls into the water trough, with all three of them laughing at the end.\u00a0Jeb also dances with all the other farm animals as they celebrate Pearl's farm being saved and re-opened.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Jeb's personality befits his nature, given that many goats are often very stubborn.\n*Jeb is used on signs at the goat petting area at [[Rafiki's Planet Watch]].\n\n\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\">\nJeb.png\nclipgoat21.gif\nClipcows21.gif\ngoat Jeb.jpg\nHome-on-the-range-disneyscreencaps_com-332.jpg|Jeb and [[Grace]] helping [[Pearl Gesner|Pearl]] gather apples.\nHome-on-the-range-disneyscreencaps_com-512.jpg|\"Get off my case, [[Piggies|you little cocktail wieners]]!\"\njeb2.gif\nnormal_DisneyEnchantedPDVD_050.jpg\nnormal_DisneyEnchantedPDVD_052.jpg\nHome-on-the-range-disneyscreencaps_com-623.jpg|Jeb denies he has plenty of cans, despite the obvious.\nhome-on-the-range-disneyscreencaps.com-1011.jpg|\"I got your autograph, [[Buck|pal]]!\"\nhome-on-the-range-disneyscreencaps_com-1013.jpg\nhome-on-the-range-disneyscreencaps.com-1014.jpg|\"Ow!\"\nHome-on-the-range-disneyscreencaps_com-1127.jpg\nHome-disneyscreencaps com-1163.jpg|\"Well, I think we all know what happens now.\"\nhome-on-the-range-disneyscreencaps_com-1327.jpg|\"Now we all get eaten!\"\nnormal_DisneyEnchantedPDVD_124.jpg|\"They're stew meat.\"\nHome-on-the-range-disneyscreencaps_com-4461.jpg|\"Hogwash!
