He respectfully calls Jasmine \"Princess\" or \"Your Highness.\" He helps manage the stables and take care of [[Sahara]]. Though Sahara hates almost everyone he meets he seems to tolerate Hakeem more than most people. When Sahara goes missing he comes to Jasmine for help, and is confused because he knows he closed the gate. Hakeem then worries over the possible loss of his job because the money helps to clothe and feed his brothers and sisters. Jasmine comforts him, tells him to not to give up, and that she will find Sahara. She sends him off to school and tells him not to worry. He responds with \"How can I not?\"\n\n\n\nLater that evening [[The Sultan]] askes Hakeem to bring Sahara to him just in time for Jasmine to ride in with him. She covers for him saying that she took Sahara out for a ride.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Hakeem bares many physical similarities to a young [[Aladdin (character)|Aladdin]].
