She is a lovely, devoted wife, mother, and doctor, with a cheerful demeanor and an understanding attitude.\n\n==Backgrounds==\n===Physical Appearance===\nAnn looks identical to Kim but is taller in height with lighter hair, blue eyes, and a more pinkish color to her skin. Her red orange hair is silkier than Kim Possible's.\n\nHer casual attire usually consists of a magenta sweater and a purple skirt with a matching skirt and high-heels. Her business attire is much the same, only with a dark purple suit jacket or a white lab coat. When performing surgery, she wears green surgical scrubs.\n\n===Personality===\nAnn is a nice but firm person, with a cheerful attitude. She is also very understanding, but she has a hair-trigger temper, which Prince Wally almost found out first-hand. In her eagerness to be accepted by her daughter's peers during a Sophomore ski trip weekend, she forgot her boundaries and unintentionally embarrassed Kim.\n\nAnn is able to do the puppy-dog pout, just like her daughter, often to get Kim to cave into her mother's wishes.\n\n===Biography===\nAnn graduated from the [[University Of Upperton]].\n\n===Abilities===\nAnn worked as a skilled neurosurgeon at the [[Middleton Medical Center]]. She is\u00a0an excellent parent who\u00a0exhibited remarkable adaptability to uncertain situations during her brief forays into heroics alongside her family.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Family===\nAnn often tended to serve as the voice of reason in her family. She scolded Jim and Tim when they experimented in the house, offered Kim motherly advice on various social challenges, and constantly reminded her husband, James, to be home in time for dinner.\n\nShe was apparently well-liked outside of her immediate family as well. Her brother-in-law, Slim, asked after fondly when she was unable to visit his ranch with the rest of her family.\n\n===Coworkers===\nAnn appeared to be on good terms with her coworkers. One of Kim's pet peeves was that Ann would accept personal calls from her while performing surgery and put her on speakerphone, which allowed Ann's coworkers to listen in and comment.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Her first name wasn't revealed until the first part of the episode \"Graduation.\" Before then, Kim Possible fan writers had long assumed that it was her given name.\n*She makes as an excellent replacement for Ron, as shown in the episode \"[[Mother's Day]]\".\n*She is voiced by [[Jean Smart]], who was also in ''[[Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey]]''.\n*In the ''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]'' crossover episode \"[[Rufus (episode)|Rufus]]\", Kim says her father knows the governor of Hawaii. In [[Kim Possible episode list|Season 1]] of the new \"Hawaii Five-0\", Ann's voice actor played the governor of Hawaii.\n\n{{Kim Possible}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Possible, Ann}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]\n[[Category:Kim Possible characters]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Aunts]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
