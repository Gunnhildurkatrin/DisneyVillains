When Flynn was shipwrecked in the [[Never Land Desert]], she showed him where to find water and they became friends.\n\n==Role in the series==\nIn the episode ''[[Pirates of the Desert]]'', [[Jake (Pirate)|Jake]] and his crew met Camille and her owner Captain Flynn when the puny pirate team traveled through the vast [[Neverland]] desert. [[Cubby]] learned that Camille's way of playing is head-butting. So, Jake asks Camille to play with Hook, knocking the captain and [[Mr. Smee]] off the ship. [[Izzy]] then uses [[Pixie Dust|pixie dust]] on the ship to fly over to Pirate Island where Flynn and Camille decide to stay until the ship is repaired.\n\nThe next episode ''[[The Great Pirate Pyramid!]]'', Flynn finds a broken map piece in his ship's quarters. Cubby quickly understands the map and tells the crew that it leads to The Great Pirate pyramid. With the ship repaired, they set sail. While out in the Never Sea,\u00a0[[Sharky and Bones |Sharky]], one of Hook's crew members, reveals his talents to read lips and begins to read those of Izzy and Cubby using a telescope to see up close. He does so successfully, having Hook wanting to find the pyramid. Once they reach their destination, Camille finds the complete map and connects the broken pieces. The map becomes a moving painting and reveals that the pyramid is available to be a hideout to a great pirate and is able to hold a ship inside. Flynn decides to reside at the pyramid and loads in The Barracuda. Jake, Izzy, Cubby, and Skully bid Flynn a farewell.\n\nCamille returns in the episode ''[[Captain Flynn's New Matey]].''\u00a0She was sent by Flynn to bring the puny pirate crew to the [[Pirate Pyramid]] since he needed Cubby's help reading a special treasure map. Along with Captain Flynn, Camille attended Jake's birthday celebration with the rest of the pirate teams and Never Land friends in \"[[Jake's Birthday Bash!]]\"\n\nCamille reappears in the episode ''[[Sand Pirate Cubby!]]''\u00a0She was sent by Flynn to bring Jake and his crew to the Pirate Pyramid so Cubby could take part in the test of the Never Land Desert, and become a Sand Pirate. Camille also took part in the trail as Cubby and [[Sharky and Bones|Bones]] transportation through the desert.\n\nIn the episode ''[[Song of the Desert]],'' Camille transports Captain Flynn to Sharky and Bones, who have invited Flynn to perform in a concert held in Never Land which in reality was a scheme cooked up by Captain Hook to lure Flynn from the pyramid, allowing Hook and Smee to raid the pyramid for treasure.\n\n==Episode Appearances==\n*\"[[Pirates of the Desert]]\" (first appearance)\n*\"[[The Great Pirate Pyramid!]]\"\n*\"[[Captain Flynn's New Matey]]\"\n*\"[[Jake's Birthday Bash!]]\"\n*\"[[Sand Pirate Cubby!]]\"\n* \"[[Song of the Desert]]\"\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink|Camille/Gallery}}\n\n{{Jake and the Neverland Pirates}}\n[[Category:Jake and the Never Land Pirates characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Camels]]"
