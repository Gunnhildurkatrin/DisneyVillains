Kept alive by means I don't pretend to understand.|B.O.B. revealing the identities of the Humanoids}}The '''Humanoids''' were cloaked figures that appear in the film ''[[The Black Hole]]''. They use to be the original crew of the [[U.S.S. Cygnus]] until [[Hans Reinhardt]] had their wills taken away and became things he could command.\n\n==Background==\nWhen Reinhardt ignored the orders to return home, the crew turned to Frank McCrae, the only officer they trusted most. When they tried to commit mutiny, the crew were captured by the [[Sentry Robots]] and were lobotomized, turned into humanoid robots dressed in cloaks and faceless masks. Without their wills, they became things Reinhardt could control.\n\nWhen the crew of the [[U.S.S. Palomino]] came aboard, Reinhardt told them the crew abandoned ship and he stayed behind. However, the crew noticed human behavior from the Humanoids. Captain Dan Holland witnessed them perform a ceremony with the ritual and honors of a human funeral. [[Harry Booth]] noticed something about the Humanoid gardener when he looked at him. He even saw him walk with a limp. Their suspicions were confirmed when [[B.O.B.]] showed [[V.I.N.CENT]] the hospital and what was left of the crew.\n\nAs the Cygnus was on the edge of destruction, the Humanoids did nothing but stay at their posts, they didn't even bother to save Reinhardt when he cried for help. He had reprogrammed them ''too'' well, and that aided in his downfall.\n\nIn the eerie 'Hell' scene at the climax, as the morbid, grotesque mutant combination of Reinhardt/Maximillian watched from the top of a volcanic hill, hellish paths and valleys were full of the specters of the mindless humanoids, slowly moving past as the (assumed) wreckage of the doomed [[U.S.S. Cygnus]] burned in the pit.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\">\nHumanoid_Original_Costume_05.jpg|One of the original costumes\nHumanoid_Promo_04.jpg\nHumanoid_Promo_12 (1).jpg|The robot funeral\nHumanoid_Screencap_01.jpg\nHumanoid_Screencap_07.jpg\nHumanoid_Screencap_10.jpg|Humanoid unmasked\nTumblr n7r42fBjBK1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\nTumblr_nc7zzarD8t1qhcrb0o1_1280.jpg\n[[File:Robot_hell.png|thumb|Robot Hell]]\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Black Hole}}\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:The Black Hole characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]"
