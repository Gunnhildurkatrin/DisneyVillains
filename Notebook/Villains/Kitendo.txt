He is  Makini's father and Fikiri's mate. He debuted in \"[[Journey of Memories]]\".\n\n==Role in the series==\n===''[[Journey of Memories]]''===\nIn this episode, Kitendo and his mate Fikiri are only seen in flashbacks.\n\nIn the first flashback, Makini remembers that she had so much fun at the river with her parents. When Fikiri notices Kitendo feeling cold in the water, she tells him to test the water to see if it is just right or cold before diving in. In the water, she tells Kitendo and Makini that whenever they take a bath in the river, they should never feel afraid to be cold to which her mate tells the two to do it his way.\n\nIn the second flashback, Makini recalls that she spent time with her parents when she was at the oasis the last time in which she explains to [[Beshte]] that they told her she might be a Royal Mjuzi when she gets older. Kitendo then tells Makini that spending time in the oasis' water is more fun, in which his mate Fikiri tells him that following the path without water leads to the [[Tree of Life (The Lion Guard)|Tree of Life]] to which Fikiri explains to her daughter that [[Rafiki]] would like to meet her. After Fikiri explains to Makini about the Royal Mjuzi, Makini's parents then explain that she will always be their daughter unless Makini can explore on her own when she gets older.\n\nIn the third flashback, Kitendo and Fikiri tell their daughter that when they look back where they've been to, they can learn, even from their mistakes. Kitendo and his mate then sing to Makini to let her learn from the past of what she did so that she can learn more in the future. He and Fikiri take Makini to the Tree of Life where they present her to Rafiki and [[Janna]] in the area.\n\n===''[[Return to the Pride Lands]]''===\nIn this episode, Kitendo is finally seen not in a flashback along with his mate Fikiri.\n\nKitendo and Fikiri attend [[Kion]] and [[Rani (The Lion Guard)|Rani]]'s wedding while seeing their daughter as the Royal Mjuzi of the Tree of Life.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<br /><gallery widths=\"185\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nThe Lion Guard Journey of Memories WatchTLG snapshot 0.02.13.739 1080p.png|\"Your right, Makini!
