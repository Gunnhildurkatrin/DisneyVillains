He is voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]].\n\n==Background==\nDarkor the \"evil\" Dragon King, is the false antagonist of the ''[[Wander Over Yonder]]'' episode \"[[The Hero]]\". According to [[Sir Brad Starlight]], Draykor had kidnapped [[Princess Demurra]] and was holding her captive at his castle. But it was revealed that Brad actually had a delusional vision of the circumstances; Demurra and Draykor were in love and were planning to get married. Although he seems evil and menacing at first, Draykor is kind-hearted and truly loves the princess. After Demurra saves herself from Brad when he tries to kidnap her, she and Draykor are finally wed, although they mention that the relationship will take time and communications like all marriages realistically do.\n\n==Appearances==\n* [[The Hero]] (First appearance)\n* [[The Gift (Wander Over Yonder)|The Gift]] (cameo)\n* [[The Rager]]\n* [[The End of the Galaxy]]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nDraykor plays Toccata and Fugue.jpg|Playing Toccata and Fugue in D Minor\nthatswhyiloveher.jpg\nDrakordemmurakids.jpg|Drakor, Demurra and their 2 daughters and son\n</gallery>\n\n{{Wander Over Yonder}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Draykor, King}}\n[[Category:Wander Over Yonder characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Dragons]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Kings]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
