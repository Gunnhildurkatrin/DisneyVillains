She is recognizable for her atypical facial features, and being silent all the time. She can sometimes be mistaken for [[Cassandra (Tangled)|Cassandra]], since she wears the same maiden dress that Cassandra wears.\n\n==Role in the [[Tangled: The Series|series]]==\nShe first appeared in \"[[Cassandra v. Eugene]]\", when [[Rapunzel]] mistook her for Cassandra. Rapunzel spoke awkwardly with her, and Friedborg made no replies except displaying a creepy smile showing a huge gap between her front teeth. She again appears in \"[[Under Raps]]\", when she joined Rapunzel for a \"ladies lunch\" arranged for Cassandra. In \"[[The Way of the Willow]]\", she gets reacquainted with [[Queen Arianna]]'s sister, [[Willow]]. It is hinted by Willow that she and Friedborg used to get into a lot of trouble when they were young. In \"[[Painter's Block]]\", she attends an art class that was orchestrated by [[Mrs. Sugarby|an evil spirit]] who was disguised as an old woman, so she could use Friedborg and her classmates to perform a spell that would free her master before Rapunzel freed them from her control.\n\n== Trivia ==\n*Friedborg is allergic to lizards, so she cannot get along with [[Pascal]].\n*In \"[[Rapunzel and the Lost Lagoon]]\", Miss Tasha (the matchmaker) while examining the aura of people, states that Friedborg has a red flame, the sign of a romantic. Friedborg match \"will have a green flame. To soothe your passionate heart\".\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nUnder Raps 24.png\nFreidborg-1.jpeg\nPainter's Block 24.jpg\nSecret of the Sun Drop 24.jpg\nHappiness Is...
