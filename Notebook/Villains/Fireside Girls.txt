The only known troop in Danville is Troop 46231. The girls\u2019 names are, from left to right: '''Holly, Ginger Hirano''', '''Gretchen''', '''Adyson Sweetwater''', '''Katie''', and '''Milly'''. This troop appears to be led (at least partially) by [[Isabella Garcia-Shapiro]], while the organization appears to be led (and founded) by [[Eliza M. Feyersied]]. Its founding time is unknown, but it can be assumed it is relatively recently due to Eliza still being alive. It is unknown if there are additional troops in Danville, however there is a troop located in France (\u201c[[Buford Confidential]]\u201d). It has also been suggested that there has been troop activity in or near Equatorial Africa (\"[[Where's Perry?]]\", Part One).\n\nThe girls show a large variety of skills, and often use these to help [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]] and [[Ferb Fletcher|Ferb]] with their Big Ideas. They also use their handbook, which contains information on a large variety of subjects - such as time travel and car engines (\u201c[[It's About Time!]]\u201d, \u201c[[The Fast and the Phineas]]\u201d). Most of the activities or information listed within the guidebook are often linked to [[Fireside Girls#List of Fireside Girl Accomplishment Patches|patches]], and most of these patches allow them to help [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]] and [[Ferb Fletcher|Ferb]] in one of their many [[Fireside Girls#Participation in the Big Ideas|Big Ideas]].\n\n==Members==\nThere are seven regular members of the troop, with an eighth member as a recent inductee; three new girls have been noticed recently, though they may not be from the same troop as Isabella\u2019s. Since \u201c[[Isabella and the Temple of Sap]]\u201d, [[Isabella]], [[Adyson Sweetwater]], [[Gretchen]], and [[Katie]] had actually been addressed by name. The names of all of her troop members (Except the blonde, brunette, and brown) were revealed in \u201c[[Ask a Foolish Question]]\u201d. In \u201c[[Buford Confidential]]\u201d, three named Fireside Girl troop members are seen with names: [[Brigitte, Josette, and Collette]], who are from France and visit Isabella. In \"[[Tour de Ferb]]\", another was seen, but didn't speak in the episode, and wasn't seen ever again.\n{| border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n|width=\"100\"|'''Picture'''\n|'''Description'''\n|-id=\"gretchen\"\n|[[File:Gretchen.jpg|100px|Gretchen]]\n|'''[[Gretchen]]''' is the girl who has short brown hair and wears glasses. She appears to be the most intelligent member of the group, often saying things that the rest of the girls do not understand. Since Adyson was able to lift her while she was rock-climbing with a heavy book, it can be assumed she is the lightest member of the troop.\n|-id=\"Adyson Sweetwater\"\n|[[File:Adyson.jpg|100px|Adyson Sweetwater]]\n|'''[[Adyson Sweetwater]]''' is the girl who has straight brown hair and wears a sleeveless uniform and a red headband (which is sometimes accidentally colored with her hair's color), and a snarky sense of humor. She takes charge of the group when Isabella isn't around in \u201cSummer Belongs to You!\u201d She also used to hold the record for \u201cMost Patches earned in One Day\u201d, which was 6, until [[Candace Flynn]] broke her record with a massive total of 49 patches in \u201c[[Fireside Girl Jamboree]]\u201d. In \u201c[[The Great Indoors]]\u201d, she is shown to be rather accident-prone. She is named after and based on Jeff \u201cSwampy\u201d Marsh\u2019s granddaughter.\n|- id=\"holly\"\n|[[File:Holly.jpg|100px|Holly]]\n|'''[[Holly]]''' is the African-American girl with two small buck teeth that sometimes aren\u2019t visible. She, along with Gretchen, got seasick in \u201cThe Ballad of Badbeard.\u201d\n|- id=\"katie\"\n|[[File:Katie.jpg|100px|Katie]]\n|'''[[Katie]]''' is the girl with light skin and blonde hair. In \u201c[[Out to Launch (Phineas and Ferb)|Out to Launch]]\u201d, she interrupted Isabella while she was trying to ask Phineas to the dance.\n|- id=\"milly\"\n|[[File:Milly.jpg|100px|Milly]]\n|'''[[Milly]]''' is the member with curly brown hair, freckles, and a yellow bow (which is not always completely visible). Her uniform has a red collar and a red circular pattern on the sleeves and the bottom and wears black Mary Jane shoes, unlike the other Fireside Girls.\n|- id=\"Stacy Hirano\"\n|[[File:Profile - Stacy Hirano.png|100px|Stacy Hirano]]\n|'''[[Stacy Hirano]]''' is a teenage member and best friend of Candace Flynn.\n|- id=\"Ginger Hirano\"\n|[[File:Ginger.jpg|100px|Ginger Hirano]]\n|'''[[Ginger Hirano]]''' is the Asian-American member who is the younger sister of [[Stacy Hirano]]. She told Phineas that he\u2019d left the lens cap on the camera in \u201c[[Lights, Candace, Action!]]\" and gave the boys a report on the pets\u2019 complaints in \u201cInterview With a Platypus.\u201d It's revealed in \u201c[[Isabella and the Temple of Sap]]\u201d that she also has a crush on [[Baljeet Tjinder|Baljeet]].\n|-\n|[[File:NewBlondeFiresideGirl.jpg|center]]\n|This unnamed blonde girl appears to cheer on Candace and [[Lawrence Fletcher|Lawrence]] in \u201cI Was a Middle-Aged Robot.\u201d She also makes another cameo in \u201c[[The Beak]]\u201d to deliver Isabella\u2019s newspaper. She also appears during the song [[Summer Belongs to You (song)|Summer Belongs to You!]] at the end of [[Phineas and Ferb Summer Belongs to You!]] as well as one of the Patchkins in \"[[Wizard of Odd]]\".\n|-\n|[[File:NewBrunetteFiresideGirl.jpg|100px]]\n|This unnamed brunette appears to cheer on Candace and Lawrence in \u201c[[I Was a Middle Aged Robot]]\u201d. This is her only appearance.\n|- id=\"melissa\"\n|[[File:Melissa.jpg|100px]]\n|'''[[Melissa]]''' is a member of the junior Fireside Girls, the Lil\u2019 Sparks, who accompanies Isabella in the episode \u201c[[We Call it Maze]].\u201d She has blonde hair with pigtails, light blue eyes, freckles, yellow socks, and like Milly, black shoes. She greatly admires Candace for her having obtained 50 patches in one day. She also made a cameo in \"[[Great Balls of Water]]\" and \"[[Happy Birthday, Isabella]]\".\n|-\n|[[File:Unnamed brown Fireside Girl.jpg|100px]]\n|This unnamed brown-haired girl appears only in the episode \u201c[[Tour de Ferb]]\u201d, helping out with the bike race that Isabella and her friends are racing in. She wears a sleeveless shirt with a red collar, brown checkered shorts, and yellow shoes.\n|}\n===Not shown===\n*Other Fireside Girls in the front seats of the Rollercoaster and the monster unicycle in \"[[Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension]]\", as well as in a commercial doing a salute in \"[[Ferb TV]]\".\n*'''Brigitte''' (voiced by Angelie Guilbaud); The French girl has short black hair and blue eyes.

Only appearance: \"[[Buford Confidential]]\"\n\n==Accomplishment Patches==\nThroughout the show, [[Isabella Garcia-Shapiro|Isabella]] and the Fireside Girls are earning patches. Usually, they are conveniently linked to whatever [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]] and [[Ferb Fletcher|Ferb]] are doing for the day, while others are just mentioned. Though the patches are usually just glanced over, the girls in Isabella\u2019s troop are all extremely enthusiastic about earning patches, and their sashes are usually shown full of patches.\n\nIt should also be noted that even if a troop member has already earned a patch, they can still get more by doing the same task again. In \"Isabella and the Temple of Sap\", regarding the 'Help Thy Neighbor Patch', Ginger Hirano had 52 of them and Milly has 53 (because she 'went back that one afternoon').\n\n===Fireside Girl Patches by Episode===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"1\"\n| width=\"20%\" | '''Episode'''\n| width=\"30%\" | '''Patches'''\n| width=\"50%\" | '''Notes'''\n|-\n|\"[[Lawn Gnome Beach Party of Terror]]\"\n|Aquatic Safety Patch\n|Earned by becoming lifeguards at Phineas and Ferb's beach party. Though not seen, the title of the patch could mean that they were practicing Aquatic Safety, or it could just be they went to the beach and none of them were injured and all swam safely. Earned by the whole troop.\n|-\n|\"[[Run Away Runway]]\"\n|Sewing Patch\n|Earned by helping the boys with their fashion designs. While Isabella helped the boys with her designs, we also saw her troop standing nearby with various equipment for designing clothes.\n|-\n|\"[[The Magnificent Few]]\"\n|Milking Patch\n|Earned by Isabella after successfully learning how to milk a cow. Isabella stated that it was one of her easiest patches, saying that all you had to do was 'squeeze and pull' over and over. Since Isabella was the only Fireside Girl present, most likely she was the only girl to earn this patch.\n|-\n|\"[[I Scream, You Scream]]\"\n|Tonsillectomy Patch\n|Earned by Isabella after getting her tonsils removed. In real life, there are many Girl Scout patches they relate to just going through a brave act or tough obstacle (there is a patch for braving a house fire, for example), which is most likely where this patch's idea came from. Since Isabella is the only known Fireside Girl to have her tonsils removed, and she is the only one shown earning it, she is the only girl so far known to have gotten it.\n|-\n|\"[[Get That Bigfoot Outa My Face!]]\"\n|Tent Pitching Patch, Marshmallow Patch\n|Earned while she and her troop were at Camp Phineas and Ferb. As the names imply, the Tent Pitching Patch is earned if the whole troop is able to put up their tents successfully, and the Marshmallow Patch is earned when the girls roast marshmallows and the camp director (in this case Phineas) approves of them. Since all the girls were at Camp Phineas and Ferb, everyone in the troop earned both these patches.\n|-\n|\"[[De Plane! De Plane!]]\"\n|Aeronautic Patch\n|Earned by helping the boys build the Paper Pelican. The girls also flew in the plane and helped with catering, which is probably parts to the patch as well. All the girls earned this since all were present at the time of building and all flew in the plane.\n|-\n|\"[[Let's Take a Quiz]]\"\n|Broadcasting Patch\n|Earned by helping Phineas and Ferb produce their game show. Isabella was taught how to fix and work the camera and helped get the game show in order. Isabella is most likely the only one who earned this patch, though we see Gretchen applying makeup and Holly and Ginger Hirano were working the cameras.\n|-\n|\"[[That Sinking Feeling (Phineas and Ferb)|That Sinking Feeling]]\"\n|Shrimp Net Repair Patch\n|Earned by repairing shrimp nets at the harbor, but this is never seen in the episode. Isabella mentions this to Phineas while he is on the boat at the harbor, and is with her whole troop, so all the girls earned it.\n|-\n|\"[[Isabella and the Temple of Sap]]\"\n|Saying A Word No One Else In The Room Knows Patch, Help Thy Neighbor Patch, Sap Collecting Patch, and I Just Saw A Cute Boy Patch\n|\n[[Gretchen]] earns the first patch by saying the word 'Sesquipedalian' in front of the other girls. Since no one else knew what it meant, she earned the patch. The Help Thy Neighbour patch is usually used as an excuse for Isabella to help Phineas with his projects, though the other girls say that they have earned the patch 50 or more times. The Sap Collecting patch was earned when [[Holly]] and [[Katie]] got the sap out of a tree. Although the 2 aforementioned girls actually ''got'' the sap, Isabella said they all earned it. The I Just Saw a Cute Boy patch is earned for just that, seeing a cute boy. However, it can be taken away if no one else agrees.&nbsp; This happens to [[Ginger Hirano]] a couple of times throughout the episode, where she puts on the patch whenever she sees or thinks about [[Baljeet Tjinder|Baljeet]]. Isabella also appears to have one visible at the top of her sash during the Fireside Girl song. This is most likely referring to [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]].\n|-\n|\"[[Cheer Up Candace]]\"\n|Expert Makeover Patch\n|Isabella has stated that she has already earned this patch, but it is unknown if the other girls have or not. Despite the fact that Isabella is a very avid cosmetologist for earning this patch, Phineas and Ferb do not enlist her help when they give Candace a make-over.\n|-\n|\"[[Fireside Girl Jamboree]]\"\n|Honesty Patch, Enthusiasm Patch, Senior Service Patch, Totem Pole Carving Patch, Ice Cream Juggling Patch, Mountain Climbing Patch, Running With The Bulls Patch, Running With The Bullies Patch, Discovering Something That Doesn't Exist Patch, Wrestling An Alligator In A Sewer Patch, Bug Collecting Patch, Motion Sickness Patch, Cupcake Delivery Patch, All Time Record Patch, and finally 37 unknown patches\n|\nAll of these patches and more were earned by [[Candace Flynn|Candace]] in order to join the Fireside Girls.\n|-\n|\"[[Phineas and Ferb (video game)|Phineas and Ferb video game]]\"\n|Tire Changing Patch\n|[[Gretchen]] mentioned this in the [[Phineas and Ferb (video game)|Phineas and Ferb video game]], so it can be assumed that this is a real patch, despite never being mentioned on the show. If such was true, most Fireside Girls must have earned this patch, in [[The Fast and the Phineas]].\n|-\n|\"[[Phineas and Ferb Christmas Vacation!]]\"\n|Santa's Helper Patch\n|[[Isabella Garcia-Shapiro|Isabella]] had this as a gift from Santa.\n|-\n|\"[[Phineas and Ferb-Busters!]]\"\n|Mountain Moving Patch\n|Isabella tells Candace that the impossible is possible, and she and the Fireside Girls were able to do it with their teamwork.\n|-\n|\"[[Robot Rodeo]]'\n|Rodeo Clown Patch\n|Phineas specifically asks Isabella what patches the girls still need, and Isabella goes through a list of patches. However, Isabella participates in the rodeo as a rider, not a rodeo clown.\n|-\n|\"[[The Beak]]\"\n|Intrepid Reporter Patch\n|Isabella kept asking Phineas to get an exclusive interview, but Phineas kept rejecting her because he and Ferb were too busy with their superhero double life.\n|-\n|\"[[We Call it Maze]]\"\n|Zookeeping Patch, Cooking Patch, Astronomy Patch, High Wire Patch\n|The first three patches are mentioned by Melissa at the start as patches she plans on earning. Isabella mentions the last one as she, Candace and Melissa are in the high wire section of the maze and have earned it twice.\n|-\n|\"[[The Great Indoors]]\"\n|Desert Tracking Patch, Rainforest/Jungle Navigation Patch, Rock-climbing Patch, Non-power Flight Patch, Swift Water Rescue Patch, Concussion First-aid Patch\n|The first four were that Phineas and Ferb created a bio-dome to make any environment to help them earn their patches, while the last two were when Adyson Sweetwater was washed away from a river and a rock falls on her head.\n|-\n|\"[[Phineas and Ferb Interrupted]]\"\n|Whittling Patch\n|Baljeet mentions this patch when sarcastically saying that Isabella getting the patch \"is so exciting\" after Isabella tells him that he speaks boring.\n|-\n|\"[[Lotsa Latkes]]\"\n|Golden Year Assistants Patch\n|Isabella mentions this patch when Phineas and Ferb helping her in making some latkes.\n|-\n|\"[[The Remains of the Platypus]]\"\n|Flier Delivery Patch\n|Isabella mentions this patch when telling the Fireside Girls they're going to earn this, and that Adyson Sweetwater states they have done this before.\n|-\n|\"[[Doonkleberry Imperative]]\"\n|Medival Siege Engine Patch\n|Isabella mentions that this was the first patch she earned.\n|-\n|\"[[Meapless in Seattle]]\"\n|Unearthing Ancient Container Patch\n|Isabella mentions this when starting to look for the cutonium.\n|-\n|\"[[Buford Confidential]]\"\n|North American Tracking Patch\n|She and the French Fireside Girls earn this as they track Buford dressed as a grizzly bear and chased him.\n|-\n|\"[[Doofapus]]\"\n|Magic Patch\n|She tells that she recently earned it by showing Phineas and Ferb their new invention.\n|-\n|\"[[Where's Perry?]]\"\n|Grub Eating Patch, Water-Finding Patch, Identifying Fauna and Flora Patch\n|Isabella found a bunch of grubs and, seeing how gross they were, wondered how she would get this patch. Later, she found out there were grubs in the s'mores she ate and that she was able to get it now. It is not shown whether Isabella gets the Water-Finding Patch or Identifying Fauna and Flora Patch, but since she made remarks saying that they would be easy to earn, it is assumed that she did achieve them.\n|-\n|\"[[What'd I Miss?]]\"\n|Surfing Patch\n|This patch was never earned, because Isabella changed her mind but it is still mentioned.\n|-\n|\"[[Fly on the Wall]]\"\n|Lizard Feeding Patch\n|This patch was never earned, because Candace manage to escapes them but it is still mentioned.\n|-\n|\"[[Bee Day]]\" /<br />\"[[Bee Story]]\"\n|Beekeeping Patch, Exploration Patch, Advanced Knot Tying Patch, Appliance Repair Patch, Semaphore Patch, unidentified\ndance-related patches\n|All the girls earned their Beekeeping Patches, which was first mentioned by Isabella in \"Bee Day\"; it was stated in \"Bee Story\" that Milly, Katie & Gretchen earned the Exploration Patch, Ginger & Holly had earned the Advanced Knot Tying Patch, and Isabella & Adyson both earned the Appliance Repair Patch. When the girls discuss communicating with their bees, Katie mentions that she had her Semaphore Patch. Isabella also says \"dance patches we have\" but does not specify names or types of dances.\n|-\n|\"[[Knot My Problem]]\"\n|Overcoming Claustrophobia Patch\n|This patch was mentioned by Isabella as she help finish tying the giant Gordian Knot.\n|-\n|\"[[Night of the Living Pharmacists]]\"\n|Judo Patch, Hapkido Patch, Jujustu Patch\n|[[Baljeet Tjinder|Baljeet]] tried to calm a worried Phineas by telling him that Isabella had earned these martial arts patches \"just last week\" (i.e. a week prior to this story).\n|}\n\n====Outside the Series====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"1\"\n| width=\"20%\" | '''Episode'''\n| width=\"30%\" | '''Patches'''\n| width=\"50%\" | '''Notes'''\n|-\n|\"[[Phineas and Ferb (video game)|Phineas and Ferb video game]]\"\n|Tire Changing Patch\n|[[Gretchen]] mentioned this in the [[Phineas and Ferb (video game)|Phineas and Ferb video game]], so it can be assumed that this is a real patch, despite never being mentioned on the show. If such was true, most Fireside Girls must have earned this patch, in [[The Fast and the Phineas]].\n|}\n\n====Unconfirmed Patches====\nSometimes, Isabella or another Fireside Girl will be making a sarcastic remark, and it is unknown whether the patch she is talking about is real or not. Others are very over the top in terms of ridiculousness, and it is unknown if they were just joking.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"1\"\n| width=\"20%\" | '''Episode'''\n| width=\"30%\" | '''Patches'''\n| width=\"50%\" | '''Notes'''\n|-\n|\"[[The Chronicles of Meap]]\"\n|You Wouldn't Know Cute If It Bit Your Legs Off Patch\n|Isabella mentioned this patch because she was upset at Phineas for not seeing her cuteness. And she is clearly meaning to insult him while saying it, though Phineas did not catch on.\n|-\n|\"[[Bubble Boys]]\"\n|Passing Through A Semi-Permeable Membrane Patch\n|Earned for passing through the giant bubble the boys made. Though the girls were excited about earning this, it is one of the patches that is seemingly too odd to actually be considered a real patch, though it is still up for debate.\n|-\n|\"[[Isabella and the Temple of Sap]]\"\n|Reckless Disregard for Life and Limb Patch\n|Another up-for-debate patch, this could have just been said to rile the girls up. It's unlikely that the fireside organization would have a patch that would put the girls in danger.\n|-\n|\"[[Fireside Girl Jamboree]]\"\n|Good Listener Patch\n|This is most likely a sarcastic remark by Isabella to Candace because for the whole episode Candace refused to listen to Isabella. She said it in a mocking tone, so it was probably meant to be sarcastic.\n|-\n|\"[[Atlantis (Phineas and Ferb)|Atlantis]]\"\n|Underwater Equestrian Patch\n|Though Isabella first mentions this patch as if it were real, when asked about it later, Isabella dryly said she was only joking and that is was impossible to actually ride a seahorse. (Buford may have proved her wrong moments later.

Little is known about this building, apart from that it is sparsely furnished, with logs as chairs. There is an emblem on top, and this building is old.(\"[[Fireside Girl Jamboree]]\") It also has a beehive. (\"[[Bee Story]]\") It has a secret bunker that Candace recorded for the Fireside Girls Compendium Guide. (\"[[Just Desserts]]\")\n\nThey also have a clubhouse in the woods, with its exact location unknown. This clubhouse appears to be secret, with both defensive procedures and a secret knock for access. It has basic amenities, including a usable sink, and supplies, including water balloons. (\"[[Isabella and the Temple of Sap]]\")\n\nThe third building is located on an island in the middle of the sea. This building is the Fireside Cupcake Factory. (\"[[Fireside Girl Jamboree]]\")\n\n==Fireside Girls Anthem==\n{{Main|The Fireside Girls (song)}}\nThe Fireside Girls also have a short anthem, as well as a jingle which plays whenever they appear. The full version has so far only been seen in \"[[Isabella and the Temple of Sap]]\".\n\n==Known Rules==\n*'''Joining the Fireside Girls''': When a girl wants to join the Fireside Girls, the troop leader nominates the girl and having the rest of the members to have a second motion to accept her. After that, she then must fill up an application, read the entire training manual, and sign some insurance waivers. She then returns one week to be sworn into the group. (\"[[Fireside Girl Jamboree]]\")\n*'''Article 9, Section Charlie, Footnote 6''': \"A Troop Leader may award full Fireside Girl status to any girl who has earned 50 patches\". (\"[[Fireside Girl Jamboree]]\", allowing Candace into the troop.)\n*A Fireside Girl is only allowed two (2) times to earn a patch. (\"[[Bee Story]]\")\n\n==Lil' Sparks==\n{{Main|Melissa}}\nLil' Sparks is a group linked to the Fireside Girls in which Fireside Girls tutor Lil' Sparks to prepare them for membership to the Fireside Girls. Isabella was once a Lil' Spark and Melissa is a current member of the Lil' Sparks. Assuming that Isabella was a Lil' Spark, the other members of the Fireside Girls could have also been former Lil' Sparks at one point. The Lil' Sparks have their own magazine and a van. Camp Fire USA has a program called Lil' Stars for the same purpose. (\"[[We Call it Maze]]\")\n\n==Trivia==\n*Several more girls appear alongside the Fireside Girls in \"[[Jerk De Soleil]]\", \"[[De Plane! De Plane!]]\", and \"[[Wizard of Odd]]\". It is unknown if the ones in \"Jerk De Soleil\" and \"Wizard of Odd\" are additional Fireside Girls, but the ones in \"De Plane! De Plane!\" have been confirmed by [[Dan Povenmire]] that they are not, making it a possibility that these other ones aren't as well. However, in \"[[I Was a Middle Aged Robot]]\" two new Fireside Girls were officially seen with their uniforms as well as in \"[[Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension]]\", \"[[Tour de Ferb]]\", \"[[Buford Confidential]]\", and \"[[Ferb TV]]\".\n*Gretchen and Katie are the only Fireside Girls who appear in [[Phineas and Ferb (video game)|the ''Phineas and Ferb'' Nintendo DS game]]. However, they all appear in the [[Phineas and Ferb Ride Again|second Phineas and Ferb video game]].\n*Katie and Ginger Hirano make an early cameo appearance in \"[[Rollercoaster]]\" in a crowd shot during the unveiling of the coaster. However, in this scene, they don't have a beret making them the 1st Fireside Girls besides Isabella shown with a full head of hair (though it was fixed the musical episode). Holly (in an error) is the third one. (\"[[It's About Time!]]\")\n*The gag that the Fireside Girls Handbook has information on such a wide range of subjects is a tribute to the [[Junior Woodchucks Guidebook]]. The [[Junior Woodchucks]] is the youth group in the Donald Duck stories by [[Carl Barks]], and its most notable members are [[Donald Duck]]'s nephews, [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]].\n*[[Heinz Doofenshmirtz]] made some invention to turn the Fireside Girls invisible because he did not want to have to see them during their fund-raising activities (since they were too cute looking, and their \"big pleading eyes\" made him feel guilty), but it was not used on them (\"[[Don't Even Blink]]\") and also to try to destroy the Fireside Girls Cupcake Factory because he has an addiction to the Fireside Girl Cupcakes. (\"[[Fireside Girl Jamboree]]\")\n*The Fireside Girls have a theme song, named after them - \"[[The Fireside Girls (song)|Fireside Girls]]\". (\"[[Isabella and the Temple of Sap]]\")\n*Candace was able to join the Fireside Girls by earning 50 patches in a single day. (\"[[Fireside Girl Jamboree]]\")\n*Each Fireside Girl has at least 50 \"Help Thy Neighbor\" Patches, with each one earned by participating in one of [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]] and [[Ferb Fletcher|Ferb]]'s Big Ideas.\n*Milly, Katie, and Gretchen are the only Fireside Girls who appeared in \"[[Phineas and Ferb: The Best LIVE Tour Ever!]]\"\n*The organization's name appears to be an amalgamation of [http://www.campfire.org/start.asp Camp Fire USA] and the [http://www.girlscouts.org/ Girl Scouts].\n*They frequently sell cupcakes around Danville. The cupcakes usually come in log shaped boxes. (\"[[Don't Even Blink]]\" and \"[[Fireside Girl Jamboree]]\"), and there is a patch available for mass delivery (but there is no information available on it).\n*Usually, when the Fireside Girls appear in an episode, a jingle plays which is possibly a variation of Scotland the Brave.\n*So far, there are 8 episodes showing the Fireside Girls (excluding Brigitte) not in their Fireside Girls uniforms. (\"[[Put That Putter Away]]\", \"[[The Ballad of Badbeard]], \"[[De Plane! De Plane!]]\", [[Jerk De Soleil]]\", \"[[Candace's Big Day]]\", \"[[Robot Rodeo]]\", \"[[Wizard of Odd]]\", \"[[The Great Indoors]], \"[[A Phineas and Ferb Family Christmas]]\"). However, they are only seen in standard clothing in \"[[Act Your Age]]\".\n*[[Candace Flynn]] is the only Fireside Girl who wears a brown beret instead of an orange one like the others do. This is possibly due to that if she wore an orange beret, it would just blend in with her orange hair, although it could also mean that only full members of the Fireside Girls can wear the orange beret and that the brown beret denoted her probationary status. It is also possible that Candace chooses the color herself to not have it camouflaged.\n*'''Error''': In \"[[Isabella and the Temple of Sap]]\", Isabella mistakenly lists the troop number as 46321 instead of 46231.\n*Their motto is: \"Fireside Girls are always prepared\". This was said by Isabella in \"[[No More Bunny Business]]\", and was mentioned in the \"Speed Demons\" book. It's based on the motto of both the [http://www.scouting.org/ Boy Scouts] and [http://www.girlscouts.org/ Girl Scouts], which is \"Be Prepared\".\n*There is a teenage Fireside Girl behind Candace at the Paisley Sideburn Brothers concert in \"[[Fireside Girl Jamboree]]\". She appears only in the last few seconds before the show ends. Her face is hidden, but her uniform and short brown hair are visible.\n*In \"[[The Beak]]\", they give out newspapers throughout Danville called \"Fireside Girls Gazette\".\n*Ginger Hirano and Milly are the only Fireside Girls who appear in \"[[Transport-inators of Doooom!]]\".\n*In \"[[We Call it Maze]]\", \"Lil' Sparks\" is a sub-organization that help young girls to become Fireside girls as well as their own magazine, and Isabella was once a Lil' spark. This is similar to Camp Fire USA's \"Little Stars\" program that helps young kids become Camp Fire Boys/Girls.\n*On June 22, 2010, the makers of ''Phineas and Ferb'' revealed that they wish to make a spin-off series about Isabella and the Fireside Girls. Whether this show will happen is still unconfirmed as of late 2011. However, the show later got scrapped in which, is explained with more details in an online interview by Dan Povenmire in 2020 on YouTube.\n*An online game, [[Robot Riot! (game)|Robot Riot!]], based on [[Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension]], has all the Fireside Girls be playable characters, with the exception of [[Adyson Sweetwater]], making it the first time in an online ''Phineas and Ferb'' game that they become playable characters. Adyson Sweetwater is seen in [[Isabella's Fireside Music Challenge]], though non-playable.\n*In \"[[Ferb TV]]\", their commercial states that the organization gives extra credit for middle schools.\n*In \"[[Buford Confidential]]\", two new Fireside Girls show up that are from France, showing that there are troops worldwide, not just in [[Danville]]. Their names are Josette and Collette.\n*[[Phineas and Ferb's Rockin' Rollin' Dance Party]] at Disney California Adventure features a troupe of female dancers that wear Fireside Girls uniforms and help out assisting kids teaching them the dances in the show.\n*\"[[Bee Story]]\" reveals that they only get two chances to get a patch.\n*The girls' voices are noticeably deeper as of season 4. Also, Ginger's and Holly's voices were changed as well.\n*Other than Isabella, Ginger (''[[Waggle Dance]]'' in \"Bee Story\" and ''[[Jump Right to It]]'' in \"Night of the Living Pharmacists\") and Gretchen (also ''Jump Right to It'') are the only girls to lead a song in the series.\n* In ''[[Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Candace Against the Universe]]'', Isabella only wears her Fireside Girl uniform, while her pink pinafore is nowhere to be seen, except in flashback stills.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink|Fireside Girls}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Isabella Garcia-Shapiro]]\n*[[Candace Flynn]]\n*[[Milly]]\n*[[Holly]]\n*[[Katie]]\n*[[Adyson Sweetwater]]\n*[[Ginger Hirano]]\n*[[Gretchen]]\n*[[Unnamed Fireside Girls]]\n*[[Firestorm Girls]]\n*[[Melissa]]\n*[[The Resistance]]\n\n==External links==\n*[[w:c:phineasandferb:Fireside Girls|Phineas and Ferb Wiki: Fireside Girls]]{{Phineas and Ferb}}{{PF-Wiki}}[[es:Las Chicas del Club de Acampada]]\n[[Category:Phineas and Ferb characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Scouts]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Circus performers]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Time travelers]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Organizations]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Milo Murphy's Law characters]]\n[[Category:Bees]]"
