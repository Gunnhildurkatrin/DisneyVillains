They instantly realize a seed from the Crown was used to grow the garden and trick Clover into leading them to the Crown, which they take. Clover, with help from Princess Sofia, traps them and gets the Crown back. They tell Sofia that the Crown is theirs and that King Gideon of Enchancia's wife took it from them by mistake.
