He was created in the fifties, during the height of the Davy Crockett craze, which also was a time when the strips had left their adventure format and became more gag-based.\n\nLi'L Davy is a boy who emulates Davy Crockett, so tries to act ferocious and as if the town was an hostile jungle. When [[Jiminy Cricket]] also adopts the Davy Crockett craze, he befriends Li'L Davy. When [[Dumbo]]'s circus comes to town, Li'L Davy invites Dumbo to dinner at Mickey's house.\n\nBesides the Mickey Mouse daily strip, Li'L Davy also appeared in some of the [[Little Hiawatha]] comic stories.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
