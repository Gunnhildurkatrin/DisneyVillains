Many times, Dave is often caught in the crossfire of battles or hurt in some way by friend and/or foe. He is also whiny, talks nonstop about his family of trees, and is never noticed. As discovered in \"[[Stuck]]\", Dave has the ability to communicate with and manipulate plants. This apparently surpasses that of the other characters.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nDave the tree monster.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Yin Yang Yo!}}\n[[Category:Yin Yang Yo! characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Plants]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]"
