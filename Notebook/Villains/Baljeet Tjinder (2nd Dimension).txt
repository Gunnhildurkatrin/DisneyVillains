He is introduced to [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas-1]] and [[Ferb|Ferb-1]], whose presence in the 2nd Dimension doesn't seem to alarm him, and he tells them about the laws of inter-dimensional traveling. The overall dimensions of the multiverse are (allegedly) grouped up in a circle, in which energy allowing for inter-dimensional traveling flows through said circle clockwise, thus resulting in an extremely long trip back to the 1st Dimension, as traveling between dimensions counterclockwise would require a massive amount of energy.\n\nBaljeet manages to gather enough energy to open a portal to the 1st Dimension, but it is rendered so unstable that the slightest disturbance would cause it to close in on itself. As if on cue, [[Candace|Candace-1]] steps through the portal, causing it to close and shutting her inside the 2nd Dimension.\n\nTowards the end of the film, he is among the Resistance members that congratulate the 1st Dimension characters for their efforts in bringing down Doofenshmirtz\n\n\n\n{{PF-Wiki}}\n{{Phineas and Ferb}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Alternate Forms]]\n[[Category:Phineas and Ferb characters]]"
