He is a member of the [[The Dragon Council|Dragon Council]], and a former World Dragon.\n==Appearances==\n===''[[American Dragon: Jake Long]]''===\nHe was formerly the Central American [[Dragons (Jake Long Universe)|Dragon]]. His dragon form resembles a large orange dragon. He has tan antlers on his head and red earrings on his ears. His mane is green and his underbelly is yellow. However, unlike most dragons, he has feather wings instead of leather wings. As such, his skeletal anatomy differs greatly from other dragons where, rather than having bones throughout the wing in a finger format, he can only control the bones at the rim of his wings. This makes for lesser maneuverability and a more bird-like anatomy. The outside of his wings match the color of his scales, but the inside of his wings are a darker tan. At the fold of his wing, he has a fluff of fur.\n\n==Episode Appearances==\n===Season One===\n*\"[[Dragon Summit]]\" (first appearance)\n\n===Season Two===\n*\"[[Being Human]]\"\n*\"[[The Hong Kong Longs]]\"\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nKukulkan old.gif\nScreenshot-3.png\nDragon Summit (3).jpg\nDragon Summit (71).jpg\nDragon Summit (70).jpg\nDragon Summit (61).jpg\nDragon Summit (53).jpg\nscreenCapture 14.02.14 13-55-23.jpg\nDragon Summit (87).jpg\nDragon Summit (91).jpg\nDragon Summit (94).jpg\nDragon Summit (96).jpg\nDragon Summit (97).jpg\nDragon Summit (99).jpg\nScreenCapture 24.11.14 18-01-47.jpg\nScreenCapture 24.11.14 18-04-08.jpg\nScreenCapture 24.11.14 18-04-40.jpg\nDragon Summit (110).jpg\nDragon Summit (112).jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{American Dragon: Jake Long}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kukulkhan, Councilor}}\n[[Category:American Dragon: Jake Long characters]]\n[[Category:Dragons]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Middle Eastern characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
