Most notably, Tetti-Tatti the Opera Director, who couldn't believe that a whale could actually sing Opera and decided that Willie must have swallowed an opera singer, taking a trio of tough sailors with him to try and rescue the Opera singers so they could perform for him.\n\nWhitey, the seagull, took a newspaper to Willie, all the sea creatures excited for their talented friend as they believe he's going to be discovered and finally have his dream come true. Willie rushed out to meet the ship with Tetti-Tatti and sailors, singing for them and showing the true extents of his talents. The three sailors had no more interest in killing him, wanting to simply listen to him sing, while\u00a0Tetti-Tatti became more and more frantic, believing that Willie had eaten three Opera singers due to Willie's ability to sing with multiple voices at once. The Sailors repeatedly wrestled\u00a0Tetti-Tatti away from the harpoon and pin him to listen to Willie.\n\nAt first, it seemed that Tetti-Tetti was finally convinced, having become his manager (at one point playing the princess in ''Aida''), but later it was revealed he shot Willie with the harpoon, causing him to leap away in the distance, causing the harpoon gun to break off the ship, until he finally died. Whitey mourned his friend, as Willie's spirit enters heaven. However, he was\u00a0now able to sing with even more voices, performing for what was\u00a0implied to be\u00a0a packed audience, as the golden gates were closed with a sign which read \"Sold Out\", having realized his dream after all.\n\n==='''Personality'''===\nHe appears to be very friendly, singing for not only sailors but for his ocean friends, the seals, and a seagull. He dreams of singing at the Met and becoming a famous opera star, showcasing his unmatched talent for the world to hear, performing all sorts of operas. He doesn't seem particularly interested in monetary compensation-he just wants to sing his whale-sized heart out for all to hear.\n\n==='''Design'''===\nHe's a whale-with all that comes with it! He has a huge squishy-looking body, massive head with comparatively small eyes and mouth, boasting a rather unique attribute-having three uvulas in his throat, which allows him to sing with three different voices, even forming different words and notes with each one, leading the Opera director to believe he has swallowed not one, but three opera singers.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Make Mine Music]]''===\n{{Stub}}\n\n===''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]''===\nIn the short \"[[Relaxing with Von Drake]]\" Willie makes a cameo when Von Drake helps [[Donald Duck|Donald]] relax his ears with Willie singing \"She'll Be Coming Round the Mountain\", \"I've Been Working on the Railroad', and \"Oh Susanna\".\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\nWillie made a few appearances among the audience in the series. \n\nOne of them was  in \"[[Donald Wants to Fly]]\", where he appeared with Whitey, another seagull, and [[Big Toot]] and [[Little Toot (character)|Little Toot]] from the [[Little Toot|''Little Toot'']] segment of [[Melody Time|''Melody Time'']] during the episode's version of [[You Can Fly]].  \n\nHe also appeared in \"[[Humphrey in the House]]\", when [[Humphrey the Bear|Humphrey]] landed on his pile of fish and tried to make a sandwich out of his flipper.  \n\nAnother notable appearance was in \"[[Halloween With Hades]]\" when he was sitting with\u00a0[[Willie the Giant]]\u00a0when\u00a0[[Hades]]\u00a0walked by and greeted them. This confused the two, where Willie noted that Hades gives him \"the willies\".\n\n===''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]''===\nWillie made a cameo appearance in the episode [[O Sole Minnie|\"O Sole Minnie]]\".\n\n== Disney Parks ==\nWillie has only appeared on a poster in the queue for [[Mickey's Philharmagic]] as one of the previous shows to have been performed at the Fantasyland Concert Hall.\n\nDevelopment memos for [[Walt Disney World]] dated to Fall of 1971 show a loose outline for a never built \"Willie the Whale Complex\", an aquarium and marine mammal park which would incorporate animation into their shows in some capacity. <ref>[https://www.disneydocs.net/capital-expenditures Capital Expenditure Planning 1971-1972 - DisneyDocs.net]</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nMakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps com-5415.jpg|Willie with Whitey\nMakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps com-5310.jpg|Willie saying good-bye to his sea friends\nmake-mine-music-disneyscreencaps.com-6121.jpg|Willie approaches Tetti-Tatti's boat to sing\nmakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps_com-5815.jpg|Willie's three uvulae, which are the basis for his tenor, baritone and bass voices.\nTumblr mynw16YTn61qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\nmakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps_com-5975.jpg|Willie bowing down to the audience\nMakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps com-6061.jpg|Willie as Pagliacci\nTumblr_nahjnvZ4b81qhcrb0o1_1280.jpg|Willie playing the part of Tristan in Tristan and Isolde\nmakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps_com-6250.jpg|Willie as Mephistopholes.\nMakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps com-6314.jpg|Willie's death\nMakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps com-6491.jpg|Willie singing in Heaven\nDisney 2008 0561.JPG|Willie in a poster at the queve area for Mickey's Philharmagic.\nWillie the whale with banjo.jpg|Willie playing a banjo in the ''Mickey Mouse Works'' cartoon \"[[Relaxing with Von Drake]]\"\nWillie Little Toot Big Toot HofMCameo.png|Willie as seen in ''Mickey's the House of Mouse'' along with Little Toot and Big Toot.\nMickey Mouse willie.png|Willie in ''Mickey Mouse''\nWillie-whale-vinylmation.jpg|Operatic Willie [[Vinylmation]]\nTumblr n0vd8mVRmn1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg|Willie as the princess in \"Aida\"\nTumblr n5buaoyuq11qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\nTumblr_nahjnvZ4b81qhcrb0o1_1280.jpg\nTumblr nbioygDKTU1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\nHouse Of Mouse - (Ep. 38) - Humphrey In The House4.jpg\nHouse Of Mouse - (Ep. 49) - Halloween With Hades3.jpg|Willie the Whale and Willie the Giant\nWillietheWhale.png\nWillie the Whale got bitten unknowingly by Humphrey.png\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n<references />\n{{Make Mine Music}}\n{{Mickey Mouse Works}}\n{{Mickey Mouse (TV series)}}\n[[fr:Willie la Baleine]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Make Mine Music characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Whales]]\n[[Category:Marine Animals]]\n[[Category:Mystical animals]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse Works characters]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Mickey's Philharmagic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Spirits]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse (TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who narrate the story]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]"
