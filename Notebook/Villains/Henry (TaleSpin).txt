He is a young baby Yenkara, a creature that becomes much bigger whenever it gets drenched in water. He is forcibly taken away from his home until he manages to escape and is found and adopted by [[Molly Cunningham]].\n\n==Role in the [[TaleSpin|series]]==\nIn \"[[Mommy for a Day]]\", Henry is first seen being forced into a box by [[MacKnee]], who strikes him with his whip and declares that he's going to get rich, and closes the box, causing Henry to cry out for his mother. At [[Higher for Hire]], after the box crashes into the dock and Rebecca scolds Molly for nearly destroying the box, Henry (in his small form) escapes through a hole on a box and flies toward Molly who is sitting near the dock.\n\nThe box containing Henry, lands on MacKnee causing him to yell at [[Baloo#TaleSpin|Baloo]], [[Kit Cloudkicker|Kit]], and [[Wildcat]], and Henry hides on Molly's dress causing her to giggle. MacKnee sees this, mistaking her laughing at him, and rushes to confront her, but he confronts [[Rebecca Cunningham|Rebecca]] instead. Molly finds Henry in her dress and decides to keep him as a pet, and shows it to Kit who is helping Baloo to lift the box back up and tells her \"not now!\" She shows him to Rebecca who is talking in the phone, and she instructs her to take him for a walk.\n\nMolly builds a sand castle and puts a hat on Henry, who blindly walks toward the sand castle, destroying it and digs through the sand until he bumps into a shovel. Molly asks him if he is okay and he just say \"Momma\", leaving her confused.\n\nAt the apartment, Molly brings some food to Henry, who is in her room at the window still calling for his momma. Before Molly brings Henry some food and decides to have him wash his hands and so he does. But as he dips his hand in the bowl of water, he instantly grows big and Molly asks what he is doing up there and brings him more food. His loud belch causes Rebecca to order Molly to clean the mess, and she tells her that it was Henry, now in small form, eating and taking a bath, and asks her for a bed time story.\n\nBaloo, Kit, and MacKnee arrive, informing Rebecca that Henry is the monster that Molly was carrying, and that they need to catch it, much to Rebecca's confusion. Kit finds Molly in the bathroom and warns her not to get Henry wet, but it is too late, as Molly puts him in the tub making him big again. Rebecca, Baloo, and MacKnee enter the bathroom, and MacKnee strikes Henry with his whip, causing Henry to break through the wall, taking Molly and Kit with him, and they fly straight into the sky.\n\nHenry drys himself and turns to back into his small-size-self, and he, Kit, and Molly fall into the river. Molly tells him to get big again, and he does. Kit then realizes that he gets big when he becomes wet, and gets small when he gets dry, and Henry points to the stars leading the way to what is called the Yenkara Valley where Henry lives, and where MacKnee captured him earlier, and they fly toward it. But Henry gets dry again, and they land back on the ground and hear a crash nearby.\n\nIt was the [[Sea Duck]] having crashed landed due to one of the engines being accidentally shot by MacKnee, who meant to shoot Henry and gets stopped by Rebecca. MacKnee sneaks out of the Sea Duck, while Baloo is fixing its engine, calls out for them, and Kit orders Molly to bring Henry to the river and distracts MacKnee. Henry carries Kit, taking MacKnee with them and MacKnee falls into the river.\n\nWhile flying, a storm arrives and its wind blows them backwards passing the repaired Sea Duck. Rebecca and Baloo rescue them after Molly nearly falls to her doom, and Henry returns to his small size and Rebecca uses Kit's hat to catch Henry.\n\nMolly instructs Baloo to get to the Valley of Yenkara where Henry lives. They arrive in a beautiful valley and find Henry's Mother, but before they are able to bring him to her, MacKnee arrives and captures both Molly and Henry. Molly makes Henry big again, who then sits on top of MacKnee. She lectures Henry for sitting on top of someone, which he listens to before he returns to his mother.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\ntalespin - 104 - mommy for a day Video - Rediff Videos3.jpg|Henry after getting wet\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{TaleSpin}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Henry}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TaleSpin characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]"
