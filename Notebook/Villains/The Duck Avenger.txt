Donald originally created his superheroic identity as a means of secretly getting even with relatives such as [[Scrooge McDuck]] and [[Gladstone Gander]], but soon found himself fighting other menaces. The character is an Italian invention and, though dominant in stories in which he appears, is very much absent from all others not starring him.\n\n==History==\n===Original version===\nBorn after the approval of the comic-book character Diabolik, the first idea of a superhero based on Donald came to the author Elisa Penna. It was after the then executive director of the \"Topolino\" comic book Mario Gentilini asked for a \"''<nowiki/>'Superman' version of Mickey Mouse''\" that the cartoonist Guido Martina instead suggested to make Donald a superhero, taking the original idea by Penna, and revising and perfecting it, thus creating Paperinik (whose name is a combination of \"Paperino\", the Italian name of Donald Duck, and the suffix \"''-ik''\" from \"Diabolik\").\n\nIn the French version, he was called ''Fantomiald'', in the German version ''Phantomias'', ''Patom\u00e1s'' in the Spanish translations, and the Greek version ''Phantom Duck'' (\u03a6\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc \u039d\u03c4\u03b1\u03ba), all of them based on the master-criminal Fant\u00f4mas. In Denmark his adventures have mostly been published in small books called \"Jumbob\u00f8ger\", or \"Jumbo books\" (Due to being several hundred pages long, not for their size). He is known in Denmark as \"''St\u00e5landen''\", meaning \"The Steel-duck\" and in Sweden as \"''St\u00e5l-Kalle''\", meaning \"Steel-Donald\". These names are understood to be based on St\u00e5lmanden/St\u00e5lmannen, local translations of Superman's title, the Man of Steel. In Finland, Papernik is published in \"Aku Ankan Taskukirja\", \"Donald Duck's Pocket Book\". The Finnish name for Papernik is \"''Taikaviitta''\", meaning \"Magic Cape\". In Norway he is called \"''Fantonald''\", contracting word for phantom (Norw. spelling: \"fantom\") with the name Donald. This alludes to another (non-Disney) comic-book hero, Lee Falk's \"The Phantom\", or in Norwegian ''Fantomet''. Duck Avenger resembles The Phantom in that he is a masked hero with no actual superpowers.\n\n[[File:Paperinik.jpg|thumb|250px]]\nThe newborn Paperinik made his debut in \"''Paperinik il diabolico vendicatore''\" (lit. \"Paperinik the Diabolical Avenger\", printed in English as \"''[[The Diabolical Duck Avenger]]''\"), a two-part 60-pages story published on June 8 and June 15, 1969 respectively on issue #706 and #707. This story never saw an American release until 2015, when it was printed in ''[[Donald Duck (comic book)|Donald Duck]]'' #5 (legacy number 372) and #6 (373) under [[IDW Publishing]].\n\nThe debut story featured Donald receiving the ownership papers of Villa Rosa, an abandoned villa outside of Duckburg (\"Paperopoli\" in the original Italian version) whose owner had disappeared decades ago. Donald soon finds that the papers were actually intended for his cousin [[Gladstone]], but he is content not to correct the mistake. Visiting the villa with his nephews, he discovers the diary and an abandoned suit of [[Fantomius]], who was known as a notorious gentleman burglar and sometime vigilante active during the late 19th century and early 20th century. Donald learns his methods of maintaining a secret identity by acting as a harmless and rather incompetent gentleman during the day and during the night as a vindicator, taking revenge for his grievances against society. Intrigued, Donald decides to keep his discoveries to himself as they might prove useful.\n\nHe soon meets his own two greatest causes of grief: his ruthless and domineering maternal uncle Scrooge McDuck and his arrogant and extremely lucky first cousin Gladstone, who enjoys taunting Donald with his own effortless successes in comparison to Donald's constant efforts and failures. Deciding to take revenge on them, Donald presents the diary's notes on weapons and transportation means to Gyro Gearloose, who soon equips him with a utility belt and boots that contain many useful gadgets and also adds special equipment to Donald's car. The first mission for \"Paperinik\", as he names himself, is to steal his uncle's mattress which contains $1,000,000 in small bills. He does so by making certain that Scrooge inhales enough of a sleep-inducing drug to keep him out of action all night. He then frames Gladstone for the theft.\n\nScrooge and Gladstone, along with the police, manage to track the thief to the Villa the next day. Gladstone, trying to clear his name, decides to investigate the villa but the \"candle\" he uses for light is actually dynamite. He accidentally destroys the villa and the money ends up scattered around the area. Scrooge seems convinced that Gladstone is responsible but decides not to place charges if Gladstone manages to collect the money. Meanwhile, Donald is gloating over all of this and states that his career has just begun.\n\nDonald later discovers the second volume of Fantomius's diary in the anniversary story \"''Paperinik e il ritorno a Villa Rosa''\" (\"Paperinik and the Return to Villa Rosa\") by Fabio Michelini and Giovan Battista Carpi. The later story was 53 pages long and was first published in two parts on September 17 and September 24, 1996.\n\nThe first story is considered an Italian Duck comic classic and was popular with readers of the time as Donald acted with more confidence, intelligence, and skill than that of his regular identity. The story seems also to owe many of its aspects to its writer Guido Martina whose stories often focused on the darker and more villainous aspects of his characters' personalities.\n\nThe Avenger would come to a conflict with his female counterpart [[Super Daisy]] (known as She-Duck Avenger), [[Daisy Duck]]'s ego form. They were at a heated rivalry until it turned into a partnership alliance and friendship as well as a romantic relationship, aware of each other\u2019s identities, believing to be cheating on each other\u2019s respective lover. They would have the feeling that they\u2019ve actually known each other already as seen in Topolino # 2986 ''The Romantic Avenger''. While under the trance of the Romantic Avenger's ([[Brigitta MacBridge]]'s ego form) glue potion, they felt in love literally and snapped out once they kissed each other\u2019s lips, getting the feeling they\u2019ve already known each. After they completed their mission, the Duck couple, in their main clothes/forms, kissed each, causing them to get back the feeling they\u2019ve recognized each other\u2019s egos', only to just shrug it off. Nevertheless, they've still had their love-hate relationship/partnership while both working together while having their rivalry on trying to prove one\u2019s better than or as the other, often sometimes they believe to themselves that they could\u2019ve done better on their own even though they make a great perfect team and couple.\n\n===The second phase===\n[[File:Welcome3.png|thumb|250px]]\nIn the early stories, Paperinik wasn't actually a superhero, but a vindicator, avenging wrongs that had been done to Donald, sometimes in blatantly illegal ways. The writers toned this aspect down later and turned him into a superhero instead, as they understood it was not a good long-term idea to turn Donald into a full-time villain. The character's methods did not change much but he started targeting the criminal population of Duckburg, in particular, the Beagle Boys. This still remains his main mission today, although he occasionally faces higher profile adversaries and finds missions which require him to travel away from [[Duckburg]].\n\nThe \"old style\" stories and characterization eventually fell out of favor, and Paperinik emerged as the main defender of Duckburg, keeping watch on the city with his high-tech and always nonlethal weapons and gadgets, in a fashion much reminiscent of the Batman. The American hero is given explicit tribute in some stories where the Mayor or Police Chief of Duckburg are seen requesting Paperinik's assistance with a kind of Bat-Signal which projects the outline of a bat \"wearing\" Donald's trademark hat.\n\n[[Gyro Gearloose]] remained the only citizen of Duckburg to know about Donald's secret identity: this, however, happens just when Donald has to reveal him his secret identity for some motive. Gyro later forgot his alias by eating a Car-Can (read below). Gyro became his first and most important ally, dependably providing him with a vast array of powerful (though still often humorous) weapons and sometimes helping him in his adventures. Some other characters discovered Donald's secret time and again, but he always protected himself by erasing their memories with Gyro's \"Car-Can Sweeties\" or by leading them onto a false trail. The name \"Car-Can\" is a contraction of the Italian \"''Caramelle Cancelline''\" (lit. the \"Eraser Candies\").\n\nTo explain his knowledge of Paperinik's activities, Donald made the public believe that he is \"Paperinik's best friend\", a fact that utterly perplexes Uncle Scrooge and the other characters.\n\nMany of these stories were much more light-hearted than the first ones, and the theme of revenge was usually absent, although it is still occasionally used, especially against Scrooge McDuck.\n\n===PKNA and PK2===\nPKNA (short for \"Paperinik New Adventures\") was the first attempt of Disney Italian publishers to tell more action-oriented stories. The series continues from the previous Duck Avenger stories, yet use mostly new characters apart of the Duck Avenger himself and brief appearances of Scrooge McDuck.\n\nWhen Uncle Scrooge buys the Ducklair Tower, Donald finds there's one floor more than there's supposed to be. The Duck Avenger investigates the secret floor and meets [[Uno]], the building's artificial intelligence, who becomes his new ally and provides him with the inventions of the disappeared [[Everett Ducklair]] to fight villains such as the aliens [[Evronians]], the time traveler known as [[the Raider]], and others.\n\nThe PKNA comic series had a successful 48-issue run, with a \"what if\" issue #49 to tie with a continuation series called PK2, which was less successful and ended in issue #18.\n\n===Retelling attempts===\nPKNA, despite the change in settings, continued from the previous adventures of the Duck Avenger, but there were some unsuccessful attempts to create a new beginning that used a PKNA-like setting, likely to reach an international market or new readers.\n\nOne of these attempts was to cancel PK2 to make room for a new comic named simply ''PK'' telling a new version of the Duck Avenger's origin as part of an interplanetary team. The series was canceled after a few issues. It became available in English as \"Superduck\" at Disney Digicomics for iPod and PSP.\n\n[[File:DuckAvenger.jpg|thumb|250px|The Duck Avenger with Spike the bee in \"The Secret Origin of the Duck Avenger\".]]\nThe Duck Avenger's first appearance in an American comic was a 3-part story titled \"The Secret Origin of the Duck Avenger\", where [[Ludwig Von Drake]] has Donald becoming the Duck Avenger and has him working alongside [[Spike the Bee]] against the Evronians. This comic was published in ''[[Disney Adventures]]'' in the summer of 2000 and was the first use of \"Duck Avenger\" name. The \"Duck Avenger\" name was used as a way of giving the character the same initials as the magazine and would remain as the character's official English name even after ''Disney Adventures'' was canceled.\n\nThe video game ''[[PK: Out of the Shadows]]'' is another retelling: there, the Duck Avenger identity doesn't exist until Uno reveals his existence to Donald in order to stop an Evronian invasion.\n\nIn 2014, in [[Topolino]] #3058, \"PKNE - Paperinik New Era\" was released in four episodes. Francesco Artibani wrote \"''PK - Might and Power''\" story, and Lorenzo Pastrovicchio drew the graphics. In this issue, Raider and Odin Eidolon persuaded Donald to go back to his Duck Avenger identity, and prevent Evronian empire from rising again. In May 2015 has been published four-episode issue \"''PK - The banks of the time''\", and the story focuses on the paradoxes of time and marks the return of Lyla Lay, the charming journalist of Channel 00. This venture is scripted by Alessandro Sisti, designed by Claudio Sciarrone and colored by Max Monteduro.\n\nIn 2016, Duck Avenger appeared again in a cross-over along with DoubleDuck, the other secret identity of Donald as a secret agent/spy, called \"''PK vs DD - Timecrime''\". The series was created and scripted by Francesco Artibani, designed by Paolo Mottura and colored by Max Monteduro (who is also the creator of DoubleDuck), and it was released in four episodes on April 27 to May 4.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nPaperinik vs Inquinator acid.jpg|The Duck Avenger facing Inquinator\nPaperinik vs Inquinator smogbag.jpg\nDuck Avenger & Fantomius.jpg\nPaperinik Vs Raider.jpg|PK vs the Raider\n3118224-06.jpg\nPK vs Trauma.jpg\nCoverpkna0.jpg\nPkna 12 geena dies.jpg|The Duck Avenger holds [[Geena]] in his arms during her last moments\nSuperheroesvssupervillains.jpg\nTopo2986.jpg\nOcca105.jpg\nSuperhelden im Doppelpack.jpg\nhri.jpg\nhr.jpeg\nLe journal de mickey 3087.jpg\nIMG 8969.JPG\nDuck Avenger issue 3 RI.jpg\nDuck Avenger issue 3.jpg\nDuck Avenger issue 3 sub.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Mickey Mouse & Friends}}\n{{PKNA}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Duck Avenger}}\n[[nl:Superdonald]]\n[[Category:Alternate Forms]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Superheroes]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Nephews]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:The Sensational Six]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]"
