Her prom date was [[Dickie]] (back in 1985). Her first name is Mary Elizabeth, but people tend to call her \"Tawny\". As a teenager, she was going to the prom with Dickie, but he stood her up (in reality he was [[Stank (magic)|stanked]] by [[The Sorcerer (Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja)|the Sorcerer]] and frozen by [[Mac Antfee]], the ninja of 1985). Years later, she was still heartbroken over his disappearance, brought to tears just by his memory. But when Dickie was unfrozen and de-stanked, the second time, by her presence, and brought to his normal age, the two re-united and continued their relationship.\n\n==Trivia==\n*She was seen crying at the beginning of \"Stank'd to the Future\", yet she didn't get stanked by the Sorcerer, which is odd.\n*The question as to how she got her nickname, Tawny, is unknown as pointed out by Randy.\n*Her Voice Actress Annie Potts voiced [[Bo Peep]] from [[Toy Story]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nmy lips scream why.jpg\nTawny sobbing.jpg\nPhoto tawny.jpg\nDickie_is_dat_u.png\nTawny_10.png\nTawny_9.png\nS2TF - 550.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Randy Cunningham}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Zingwald, Mary Elizabeth}}\n[[Category:Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Schoolteachers]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
