She is infrequently at home, as she and her husband take their daughter Brianna to compete in beauty pageants. She is very caring and protective of Kick but although she's often worried about him, she acknowledges his daredevil nature, sometimes even helping him with his stunts. She was once a famous daredevil and speedboat racer called \"Honey Splash\". Honey was the one who gave Kick his trademark white jumpsuit as a present, to show him how much she supports him.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Buttowski, Honey}}\n{{Kick Buttowski: Suburban Daredevil}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Kick Buttowski characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]"
