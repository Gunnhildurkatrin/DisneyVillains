Like his pet, he is depicted as an unattractive but lovable and jovial fool, drunkenly dancing around with everyone and having a good time. When [[Zeus (Fantasia)|Zeus]]\u00a0calls up a storm, he and Jacchus are caught in the middle of it, tormented by the wind and his bolts of lightning. Both are washed away in a stream of wine when lightning strikes the grape tub they are hiding under, but forget the danger and merrily drink the wine they are sitting in. When the storm ends, he and Jacchus toast [[Iris (Fantasia)|Iris]]\u00a0for coloring the wine in a beautiful rainbow pattern.\u00a0\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\nBacchus appeared with Jacchus in ''House of Mouse''.\n\n==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==\nBacchus is featured at one of the holes of the [[Fantasia Gardens Miniature Golf]] course.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Fantasia}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Gods]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Kings]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Immortal]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Roman Mythology]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Greek characters]]\n[[Category:Greek Mythology]]\n[[Category:Fantasia characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]"
