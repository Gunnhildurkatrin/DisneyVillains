He is the nephew of Commander [[Jun Sato]] and the leader of Iron Squadron, the name of his late father's detachment. His uncle describes Mart to be rebellious, and despite being a brave and gifted pilot he is also very stubborn, especially when he refused to leave his home world.\n\n==Role in the Series==\nWhen the Empire invaded his homeworld, Mykapo, he initially refused to leave, even though his ship had a broken hyperdrive. Eventually, Mart and Iron Squadron joined forces with the Ghost crew, handing the Empire a defeat and escaping to fight another day. He was reunited with his uncle, Commander Sato, and his friends.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\">\nIron Squadron 29.jpeg\nIron Squadron 41.png\nIron Squadron 23.jpeg\nIron Squadron 44.png\nIron Squadron 9.jpg\nIron Squadron 50.png\nIron Squadron 52.png\nIron Squadron 20.jpeg\nA Fool's Hope 34.jpg\nIron Squadron Profile.jpg\nIron Squadron concept 10.jpeg\nIron Squadron concept 9.jpeg\nIron Squadron concept 3.jpeg\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Mart was named after Matt Martin, [[Lucasfilm]]'s manager of digital content and community relations.\n*Mart's surname, Mattin, is his mother's maiden name.\n\n==External links==\n*[[w:c:starwars:Mart Mattin|Mart Mattin on Wookieepedia]]\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Star Wars}}\n[[Category:Star Wars Rebels characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Captains]]\n[[Category:Rebel Alliance characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
