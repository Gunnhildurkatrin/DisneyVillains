She's Armenian-American. She is quieter and follows more than the other Ashleys, but she is just as snobby (similar to [[Ashley Boulet|Ashley B]].). Like all of the other Ashley's, she has a little sister Brittany, and a little brother Tyler. She can also be a bit clumsy at times and is considered to be the smartest of the girls.\n\n==Trivia==\n* In traditional cel-animated episodes, her hair color is dark brown, but in digital ink-and-paint animated episodes, her hair color is medium-brown.\n* She only talks in the following episodes and films:\n** \"[[Jinxed]]\"\n** \"[[First Name Ashley]]\"\n** \"[[My Fair Gretchen]]\"\n** \"[[Speedy, We Hardly Knew Ye]]\"\n** \"[[The Pest]]\"\n** \"[[Outcast Ashley]]\"\n** \"[[Pharaoh Bob]]\"\n** ''[[Recess: School's Out]]''\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nchar_31330_thumb.jpg\nchar_32653_thumb.jpg\nchar_33565_thumb.jpg\nAshley_T..png\nT1.jpg\nT2.jpg\nT3.jpg\nAshley T and Tyler T.jpg\n870870756905905904.jpg\nvlcsnap-2014-11-29-11h55m26s124.png\nvlcsnap-2014-11-29-12h04m13s40.png\nvlcsnap-2014-11-29-12h05m31s58.png\nvlcsnap-2014-11-29-20h10m01s181.png\nvlcsnap-2014-11-29-22h16m30s57.png\nvlcsnap-2016-01-20-14h40m44s294.png\nvlcsnap-2016-01-20-14h40m18s158.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Recess}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tomossian, Ashley}}\n[[Category:Recess characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Cheerleaders]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:American characters]]"
