He mainly appears in Italian, and more recently Egmont Disney comics.\n\nAlbert is tall and has a long dog-nose, but humanlike ears. His hair is generally shown as being brown and curly. He is loyal and dedicated to his boss, Scrooge, and not rarely he is in trouble because of all this loyalty and dedication, creating invariably funny situations.\n\nAlbert's first official comic appearance was in a comic story of 1967 called \"Zio Paperone e l'angolare di sicurezza\" written by Rodolfo Cimino and illustrated by Massimo De Vita. Albert has become one of the most frequently recurring characters in Scrooge's Italian stories and he's popular among Italian comic readers.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Quackmore, Albert}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Servants]]"
