He is the grandfather of [[Sprig Plantar|Sprig]] and [[Polly Plantar]], as well as the patriarch of the Plantar family.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nHop Pop is described as traditional and over-protective towards his own grandchildren. He also tends to have a high sense of paranoia whenever feeling that if something is or bound to go chaotically wrong, as seen \"[[Best Fronds]]\", when after he wakes up from a nap in his study and feared that Sprig, Polly and practically the entire town got eaten by [[Anne Boonchuy]].\n\nHop Pop also seems mistrust other amphibians by saying that they're small-minded and paranoid, an ironic, if not hypocritical, statement since he appears to be like that as well. He's even shown to be very dishonest and not willing to open up to anyone, even his family and Anne.\n\nOver the course of the series Hop Pop, while still strict at times, has lightened up quite a bit due to the adventures he has shared with the kids; letting the kids be more independent, listening to other peoples suggestions, try new things and be less uptight.\n\nDeep down, Hop Pop is a kind and caring frog and has learned the importance of helping others. Also, Hop Pop realized that he has to be more honest and open to those closest to him, especially his grandchildren and Anne.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nHop Pop is an elderly reddish orange-skinned frog of a \"crisp 68\" years old (\"[[Stakeout (Amphibia)|Stakeout]]\") with tufts of white coming out from each side of his head and normally wears gray-green waistcoat along with a buttoned yellow shirt underneath and brown trousers with spats slightly covering his feet.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Amphibia]]''===\n====Before====\nNot mush is known about Hop Pop's past except he took in his grandchildren [[Sprig Plantar|Sprig]] and [[Polly Plantar|Polly]] after their parents passed away. He is also a failed actor.\n\n====Season 1====\nHop Pop is the elder character of the cast. He spends much of the series acting as the paternal figure in the group. Much of his conflict comes from him fearing change and the world around him. He does everything he can to keep Anne, Sprig and Polly rooted with his wisdom and hopes that they can apply what he has taught them. Hop Pop appears to know more than he lets on as seen in \"[[Anne Vs. Wild]]\" where he picks up on information about the Calamity Box, but neglects to tell Anne and his grandkids about it to protect them and he buried it out of paranoia in \"[[Bizarre Bazaar]]\".\n\nHop Pop becomes something of an idol to the people of Wartwood due to him standing up for the citizens as seen in \"[[Hop-Popular]]\". He becomes so influential that he starts being viewed as a threat by the Toads outside of town. He does not realize that he has made a big deal out of it until the episode \"[[Reunion (Amphibia)|Reunion]]\", which actually frightens him somewhat.\n\n====Season 2====\nAfter it was finally safe to travel out of the valley, Hop Pop bought a caravan wagon that looks like a miniature version of the Plantar Farm that he calls the [[Fwagon]] so they can go to [[Newtopia]] in order to find Anne a way back home.\n\nUpon meeting the king of Amphibia himself, [[King Andrias|Andrias Leviathan]], the Plantars learn that in order to send Anne back to earth the 3 gems on the music box need to charged at 3 different temples.\n\nUpon returning to Wartwood, Hop Pop actions of lying to Anne came back to haunt him when she overhead him freaking out that the music box was gone when he went to retrieve it. After Anne snapped at him and ran away, Hop Pop, who doesn't blame her for being mad at him, waited for her to come back. When Sprig and Polly found out what happen along with their encouragement, Hop Pop went looking for Anne in order to set things right and apologizes to her. After finding her, Hop Pop tried to explain an angry and confused Anne his actions but got interrupted when they heard his grandchildren, who went looking for the music box, were in trouble. Hop Pop convinced Anne to work together him in order to save Sprig and Polly, which she agreed. After saving Sprig and Polly along with getting the music box, Hop Pop explained to Anne, who decided to leave his family for good, that his actions were because of what happened to his grandchildren parents as he was out of town when they were killed by heron's. Due to blaming himself for what happened to Sprig and Polly's parents, Hop Pop vowed to not let anything happen to his family again but realized that he made a mistake because she became part of his family too as he breaks down and apologized to Anne for his actions. Hop Pop was comfort by Anne, who changed her mind about leaving once she heard the truth and seeing that he's really sorry about lying, as she forgives him.\n\nDespite this, Hop Pop notices that Anne is still angry and hurt with him as he wants to fix things with her but ends up pressuring her. After hearing Anne say that she doesn't know what he needs to do in order to fix things between them and needs time to do so, Hop Pop realized the pressure he put on her as he not only apologizes to her but also encourages her to take all the time she needs, which she accepts and appreciates.\n\n=== Other apparances ===\nAn image of Hop Pop appears in the cover of [[Willow Park]]'s book about \"The Life Cycle of The Common Swamp Toad\", in ''[[The Owl House]]'' episode \"[[Escaping Expulsion]]\".\n\n==Relationships==\n{{Relationshipslink}}\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*His shoe's have a similar appearance to [[Scrooge McDuck]]'s spats.\n*His name is likely a nod to the Dr. Seuss book ''Hop on Pop''.\n*In \"[[Reunion (Amphibia)|Reunion]]\", a frog was shown in the dissection table that looks very much like Hop Pop.\n*Hop Pop seems to have taken up some of Anne's mannerisms such as saying the word \"obvi\", short for \"obviously\", as seen in \"[[A Night at the Inn]]\".\n*In \"[[Family Fishing Trip]]\", Hop Pop reveals that his favorite flowers are dandelions because according to him \"they funny\".\n*In \"[[A Caravan Named Desire]]\", his eyes are revealed to be hazel.\n*Following the rescheduling of \"[[True Colors (Amphibia)|True Colors]]\", a personal message from Hop Pop was released asking fans to wait just a little longer for the official release; comparing it to his obsession to ''Suspicion Island''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Radrappy/status/1393963080422354944|title=Hop Pop Leak Post|website=Twitter|date=May 16, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[[w:c:amphibiapedia:Hop Pop Plantar|Hop Pop Plantar]] at the [[w:c:amphibiapedia:Main Page|Amphibia Wiki]]\n\n{{Amphibia}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Amphibia characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Grandparents]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Farmers]]\n[[Category:Frogs]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Widows/Widowers]]\n[[Category:Mentors]]"
