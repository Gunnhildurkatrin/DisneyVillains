He is the Greens' grumpy neighbor who usually likes to be by himself. He does not mind his cat playing with [[Tilly Green|Tilly]]; however, though it used to bother him.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nMr. Grigorian is the grumpy neighbor to the Greens. He prefers keeping to himself and does not want to interact with anyone other than his cat Anoush. He seems to enjoy being mean to others as it is the only thing that brings him great pleasure. It is implied that his grumpiness stems from loneliness as Anoush is the only companion he has. He tolerates Tilly due to her friendship with Anoush, but despises [[Gramma Alice]] as she has a similar grumpy attitude and loves to make her miserable. \n\n===Physical appearance===\nMr. Grigorian has violet colored skin and purple hair that is combed to one side. He has a small split mustache and his eyes have dark areas underneath. Additionally, he has grey spots on his forehead. He dresses in a mahogany tweed coat with patches on the elbow and green undershirt with green tie. He wears light brown slacks and brown dress shoes.\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*His first name is, of course, backwards for [[Dracula]], while his last name is the Armenian counterpart for \"Gregory\" which means \"watchful or alert\". Both of these names are fitting for his character as he keeps an eye on things in his neighborhood like a vampiric being.\n**Based on his surname, he is most likely Armenian.\n*Cricket calls him \"a Dracula\" due to his creepy appearance.\n\n==External links==\n\n*{{Interwiki|https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/countryclub9732/images/6/64/Favicon.ico|bigcitygreens|Alucard Grigorian|Big City Greens Wiki}}\n\n{{Big City Greens}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Big City Greens characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
