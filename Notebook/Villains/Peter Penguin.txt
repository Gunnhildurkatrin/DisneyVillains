Peter decides to impress Polly and gives her a mock ice cream cone made of snow and an icicle as a gift. She nuzzles his beak and Peter becomes so ecstatic that he slides into a rock pile. He then brings her a pufferfish to eat, which keeps inflating within Polly and making her look fat. Peter finally kicks Polly in her tail feathers, and the pufferfish comes flying out. Polly feels very unhappy with Peter, and she slaps him silly and takes off into the water on a chunk of ice. Peter starts crying over his failure, but notices a shark approaching and tries to warn Polly. The shark bursts out of the water right in front of Polly and tries to eat her. Peter tries to rescue her, bringing with him a wooden club. He whacks the shark and diverts the shark's attention from Polly to him. Peter is chased onto a ledge, holding on by a measly branch. However, a boulder falls from the ledge into the shark's mouth, anchoring the shark at the bottom of the ocean. Peter and Polly marry and live happily ever after.\n\nPeter and Polly both make a cameo appearance in ''[[Mickey's Polo Team]]'' as spectators in the bleachers.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nTumblr n097s8yEZW1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\nPeculiar penguins 3.jpg\nPeculiar penguins 4.jpg\nPECULIAR PENGUINS.png\nPolly slaps peter.png\npeter crying.png\nPeculiar penguins 6.jpg\npeter and polly kiss.png\nTumblr n1410lrls11qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg|Peter and Polly's cameo in ''[[Mickey's Polo Team]]''\nIMG 2462.jpg|They lived happily ever after.
