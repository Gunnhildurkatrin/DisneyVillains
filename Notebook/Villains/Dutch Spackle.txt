He is a handyman and a house builder from two episodes, \"[[Unreal Estate]]\" and \"[[A Pizza the Action]]\".\n\n==Background==\nHe is a handyman and a house builder, plus a house mover when he was working for [[Spoonerville]].\n\n=== Physical Appearance ===\nLike all residents in Spoonerville, he is an anthropomorphic dog. His attire consists of a white cap and overalls, a peppermint pink long-sleeved shirt, brown shoes, a gray belt, and the traditional white opera gloves. He is short in terms of size and somewhat resembles Max minus the brown moustache.\n\n== Role in the Series ==\nIn the episode \"Unreal Estate\", [[Peg Pete|Peg]]\u00a0hired him to get the peppermint pink lake house painted for the buyers, Mr.\u00a0and Mrs. Sherbert. When putting a nail into a plank board with his hammer, [[Pete]] arrives and tells him he is fired and puts him on a boat and kicks him away into the lake. He later gives a attached building catalog to Pete and [[Goofy]] to build a garage attached into the house. Unfortunately they are given the wrong kit and end up building a windmill instead and it catches wind and the house ends up flying into the lake. Dutch shows up again and tells the two that someone on the other side of the lake is selling a house that looks exactly the one they lost. So Pete and Goofy go to the house and discover that the owner is Dutch who says he will give them the house in return for Pete's boat which Pete reluctantly agrees to. After Goofy paints the house, Pete along with Dutch move the house to the spot the old one was. Dutch is last seen using Pete's boat to pull a smaller boat Pete and Peg are in, and charging them for it.\n\nIn \"A Pizza the Action\", he is seen moving the half of Pete's house accidentally but it was all a very big mistake and his truck was wrecked and tripped accidentally by Goofy, [[Max Goof|Max]] and [[Waffles]], plus he's chasing his truck.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nGoof_Troop_-_Dutch_Spakle_and_Pete_Introduction.jpg\nGoof Troop - Dutch Spackle and Pete in a Confrontation - 1.jpg\nGoof Troop - Dutch Spackle and Paint Remover.jpg\nGoof Troop - Dutch Spackle 1.jpg\nGoof Troop - Dutch Spackle 2.jpg\nGoof Troop - Dutch Spackle 4.jpg\nGoof Troop - Dutch Spackle and Pete - 1.jpg\nGoof Troop - Dutch Spackle 3.jpg\nGoof Troop - Dutch Spackle Watching Peg and Pete in Love.jpg\nGoof Troop - Dutch Spackle in A Pizza the Action - 4.jpg\nGoof Troop - Dutch Spackle in A Pizza the Action - 3.jpg\nGoof Troop - Dutch Spackle in A Pizza the Action - 2.jpg\nGoof Troop - Dutch Spackle in A Pizza the Action.jpg\nGoof Troop - Dutch Spackle in A Pizza the Action - 5.jpg\nGoof Troop - Dutch Spakle and Pete Introduction - 2.jpg|\"Well, I'm Pete, aho, ho.\" (Pete imitating Dutch's chuckles)\n</gallery>\n\n{{Template:Goof Troop}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Spackle, Dutch}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Mechanics]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Goof Troop characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]"
