He goes to her direction and he learns from her that she wants to participate in the Cookie Parade, but she can't do it because she doesn't have any fancy clothes to wear for the occasion. Deciding to help her, the Hobo Cookie assures her that she will be the sweetest one of all, and gives her a full makeover so she will be able to participate in the parade.\n\nHe starts her makeover with dying her brown hair to blonde with taffy, styling it into a long updo. Then, he creates a dress using a cupcake's base, decorating it with eclair cream of blue, purple and white colors, trowing heart-shaped sweets on her dress and finishing it by giving her a big purpled ribbon on her back. He finalizes her makeover by doing her makeup out of powdered marshmallows and red heart-shaped candy.\nOnce that was done, he gives her a mirror so she could see herself and sneaks her at the end of the parade after he was given her approval. The girl is elected queen of the parade, and both of them are separated by the townspeople who trampled him while they carried the queen to her throne.\n\nDuring the show, he attempts to have a better view of her but ends up being chased by the guards who noticed him. He attempts to hide behind the cake where the suitors were performing and is quickly spotted after he thought he was safe. With no options left, he climbs up to the top to meet her behind the red carpet and ends up beaten by two angry guards who chased him. As he was about to receive another hit from the guards, the Cookie girl saves him by announcing that he will be their King, much to his surprise and glee. At the end of the cartoon, both attempt to have an intimate kiss in their thrones but their love is so warm it melted the lollypop they used to cover it.\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\nHobo appears next to one of the [[Judges]] in the film ''[[Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse]]''.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Concept Art===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nTumblr_nrb77rgco81u9mlrzo2_1280.png\nCookie carnival girl exporeel.jpg\nCookiecarnival7.jpg\nHeroCookie-600.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===''[[The Cookie Carnival]]''===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nHobocookie.jpg\n076-008want.jpg\nTumblr m5io1m6ZlP1r3jmn6o1 1280.png\n22406.jpg\nTumblr m192nlpKmg1r3jmn6o1 1280.png\nHobo Cookie.png\n076-010really?.jpg\nTumblr nj4g95qm1y1r3jmn6o2 1280.png\nTumblr lxyeirAD5J1r3jmn6o1 1280.png\nTumblr lxyel9rlG11r3jmn6o1 1280.png\n076-016group.jpg\n22410.jpg\nHobo in Cookie Carnival.jpg\nTumblr mzeqnqJDAL1r3jmn6o1 1280.png\nTumblr nj4gw4BXQw1r3jmn6o1 1280.png\n22412.jpg\n076-021melt.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nHobo Cookie in House of Mouse.png|Hobo and one of the [[Judges]] in ''[[House of Mouse]]''\nHouse Of Mouse - (Ep. 46)5.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nCookieCarnivalSheetMusic-600.jpg\nSilly Symphonies VHS Cover .jpg\nVHS cover 2.jpg\n1935 COOKIE CARNIVAL.jpg\nCookie Carnival Poster A.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Foods]]\n[[Category:Silly Symphonies characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Kings]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]"
