[[Trixie_Carter|Trixie]] is completely obsessed with him. He first appears in Season 2 in Bring It On <ref name=\"bring\">[[Bring It On]]</ref> and makes a few more appearances throughout subsequent episodes.\n\n==Physical Appearance==\nKyle is a handsome, well-built, tall youth. He has short black hair and tan skin. He usually wore a red shirt with a yellow alien-head logo, gray baggy pants, and a studded belt and bracelet. His shoes were also dark gray. Whenever Kyle participated at a formal event he wore a black tuxedo with black bow tie and a red shirt.\n\n==Personality==\nKyle mostly comes off as the strong silent type, and seems to keep to himself most of the time. However, he is far from being antisocial. He often participated with enthusiasm at school field trips and got involved with the school's community and its activities<ref name=\"home\">[[Homecoming]]</ref>, such as when he signed up for the float committee. He is also very friendly and rarely takes offense. He is the optimistic type since he was never seen in a bad mood.\n\n==Other Family Members==\nKyle has a little brother, although his name never came up. From one of Trixie's comments, apparently Kyle's brother is about five or six years younger than himself. He stands one head shorter than Trixie with tan skin and short, messy black hair like his older brother. He usually wore a blue shirt, beige shorts, and black shoes. He occasionally wore a suit based on a video game character enhanced with platform shoes and stuffed muscles which made him look older than he was. Trixie easily fell for him while in costume, thinking he was as attractive as Kyle except with a hint of mystery. Eventually, she learned the truth and had to dump him<ref>[[Haley Gone Wild]]</ref>.\n\n==Relationship with Trixie==\n[[File:Kyle_and_Trixie.png|thumb|Kyle and Trixie as graduation partners]]Initially, Kyle did not seem interested in Trixie<ref name=\"bring\">[[Bring It On]]</ref>. However, later he invited her on the school's love cruise<ref name=\"love\">[[The Love Cruise]]</ref>. A positive hint he was attracted to her. However, during cruise he was a bit put off by her throwing up on him, prompting him to invite [[Stacey Wintergrin]] instead. Trixie retaliated by using one of [[Cupid]]'s arrows on Kyle to force him to fall back in love with her. Which indicates he might not have been interested in her to the degree she wanted from the very beginning, as the arrow would have had the opposite effect, instilling a strong dislike against her. Kyle was later returned to normal when Trixie used a second arrow on him to restore his true feelings.\n\nToward the end of the school year, it seemed Kyle had grown fonder of Trixie, inviting her as his partner for graduation<ref>[[Being Human]]</ref>.\n\n==Episode Appearances==\n===Season Two===\n*\"[[Bring It On]]\" (first appearance)\n*\"[[The Academy]]\"\n*\"[[Haley Gone Wild]]\" (mentioned)\n*\"[[Supernatural Tuesday]]\"\n*\"[[The Love Cruise]]\"\n*\"[[Homecoming]]\"\n*\"[[Shaggy Frog]]\"\n*\"[[Being Human]]\" (final appearance)\n\n==Trivia==\n*Kyle Wilkins can be seen in the Season 2 intro.\n*In one episode<ref name=\"love\">[[The Love Cruise]]</ref>, Kyle talks for the first and only time in the series.\n*Kyle talks with a slight accent, which probably means he was from a different nationality, perhaps Hispanic.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nThe Love Cruise (21).jpg\nKyle.gif\n367px-Kyle Little Brother.png|Kyle's little brother\nThe Love Cruise (5).jpg\nThe Love Cruise.jpg|Kyle in Tuxedo\nKyle Wilkins.jpg\nShaggy Frog.jpg\nThe Love Cruise (7).jpg\nThe Love Cruise (9).jpg\nThe Love Cruise (10).jpg\nThe Love Cruise (12).jpg\nThe Love Cruise (14).jpg\nKyleseason2intro.jpg\nThe Academy (2).jpg\nThe Academy (3).jpg\nHomecoming (21).jpg\nHomecoming (23).jpg\nBeing Human (14).jpg\nBeing Human (15).jpg\nBeing Human (16).jpg\nThe Love Cruise (25).jpg\nThe Love Cruise (26).jpg\nThe Love Cruise (49).jpg\nThe Love Cruise (59).jpg\nThe Love Cruise (57).jpg\nThe Love Cruise (60).jpg\nThe Love Cruise (61).jpg\nHaley Gone Wild (26).jpg\nHaley Gone Wild (27).jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n{{American Dragon: Jake Long}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wilkins, Kyle}}\n[[Category:American Dragon: Jake Long characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
