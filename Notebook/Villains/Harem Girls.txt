However, they do seem very fond of Prince Ali, and presumably any other handsome individual due to their swooning his highly-publicized arrival at Agrabah. Presumably, they later act on friendly terms with Aladdin and/or Jasmine due to them being among the invites to their wedding.\n\n===Physical appearance===\n<tabber>\nFuchsia one=\n'''Fuchsia one''': She has short black hair, fairly dark skin, and an hourglass figure. She also has a long fuchsia bedlah pants, red bedlah top that shows her breast cleavage and bellybutton, fuchsia armbands, and fuchsia veil on her face. She's the only one of the three that has a beauty spot on her left cheek. She's later seen wearing a lavender outfit in \"[[Prince Ali]]\".\n|-|Pink one=\n'''Pink one''': She has short black hair, fairly dark skin, and an hourglass figure. She has a long light pink bedlah pants, light pink bedlah top that shows her breast cleavage and bellybutton, light pink armbands, and light pink veil on her face. She's the only one of the trio whose outfit's color doesn't change.\n|-|Lavender one=\n'''Lavender one''': She has short black hair, fairly dark skin, and an hourglass figure. She has long lavender bedlah pants, lavender bedlah top that shows her breast cleavage and bellybutton, lavender armband, and lavender veil on her face. She has the shortest hair of the three. She's later seen wearing a red outfit in \"Prince Ali\".\n</tabber>\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Aladdin (film)|Aladdin]]''===\nThey appear to live in some type of massage parlor with a manager (who might be their mother). They know [[Aladdin (character)|Aladdin]] when he's a street rat but they don't sympathize with his plight. (\"[[One Jump Ahead]]\").\n\nWhen Aladdin shows up in town as '''Prince Ali''', they swoon over him and are very impressed with him as he is presented by [[Genie]] who, at one point, disguises himself as one (\"[[Prince Ali]]\").\n\n===''[[Aladdin and the King of Thieves ]]''===\nThey appear in\u00a0[[Genie]]'s song, \"[[There's a Party Here in Agrabah]]\" and they were also invited to [[Aladdin (character)|Aladdin]]'s and [[Jasmine]]'s wedding as the flower girls.\n\n===''[[Aladdin (2019 film)|Aladdin]]'' [[Aladdin (2019 film)|(2019 film)]]===\n[[File:Aladdin(2019)_0487.jpg|thumb|250px|The Harem Girls, known as the School Girls in the live-action film.]]\nThe Harem Girls, who are known as the School Girls in this film, appear in live-action form in this remake of the 1992 animated musical ''Aladdin''. Unlike the original film, they seem quite fond of Aladdin, as when he accidentally enters their room during \"One Jump Ahead\", they are seen swooning over him and become somewhat concerned when their teacher tries to reprimand him.\n\nWhen Aladdin returns to Agrabah as '''Prince Ali''', they swoon over him and are very impressed with him as he is presented by [[Genie]] who, at one point, disguises himself as one (\"Prince Ali\") and they are visible surprised when Genie's disguise is exposed.\n\nThey are later seen at the end of the film during Aladdin and Jasmine's wedding and later taking part in dancing with everyone in the palace during a reprise of \"[[Friend Like Me]]\".\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*The words 'harem' and 'girls' refers to either the wives, concubines or servants occupying a section of a house reserved for women members of a Muslim household.\n*They are often compared to [[the Bimbettes]] from ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'', as they are flirtatious, fairly ditzy, and have more impressive figures than the main female lead; in this case, Jasmine. A primary difference between them, however, is that the Bimbettes are not known to have been stuck-up or snobbish to anyone in the film (except [[Belle]] to a small extent), while the Harem Girls act stuck up with Aladdin.\n*Like the Bimbettes, whose hairstyles constantly change, the Harem girls' wardrobes constantly change in color. However, unlike the Bimbettes, their names are unknown and they have shorter, darker hair.\n*Besides them, there are other harem girls summoned by [[Genie]] in the songs, \"[[Friend Like Me]]\" and \"[[Prince Ali]]\".\n\n{{Aladdin}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Aladdin characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Middle Eastern characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Dancers]]\n[[Category:Character trios]]\n[[Category:Mickey's Soundsational Parade]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Twins and Triplets]]"
