Hence his name, he is a deceased sailor controlling the helm.\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\nThe helmsman was once a sailor (likely a pirate) aboard a sailing ship in the 18th century. While sailing of the coast of [[Isla Tesoro]]'s Hurricane Lagoon in the [[Caribbean]], their ship was beached within the island's [[Dead Man's Cove|Ghostly Grotto]]. It was here that the helmsman would die in the wreck.\n\nThe helmsman's skeleton would remain intact for years to come, doomed to sail through an endless storm for all eternity. It is believed that like so many of the grotto's residents, the helmsman is haunted by the ghost of its mortal self.\n\n===Development History===\nThe Skeleton Helmsman was designed by [[Marc Davis]] and slated to appear in Pirates of the Caribbean since it was being developed as a walk-through wax-museum in [[Disneyland]]. The helmsman would appear in the final ride and become one of the staples of the attraction's iconography.\n\nOriginally, the helmsman was to have dialogue play for his scene, recorded by [[Paul Frees]], about his braving through the storm. According to this cut dialogue, the ship he was steering contained ''The Royal Fortune'' and was headed for the Spanish Main. The Royal Fortune being the name historically given to the ships of pirate [[Captain Gore|Captain Bartholomew Roberts]] who was featured in old scripts for the Pirates of the Caribbean.\n\nOriginally it was represented with an authentic human-skeleton due to the lacking quality of fake skeletons of the day. The original skeletons were eventually phased out for more realistic props however it is noted that parts of the original bones are apparently still present in the current figures.\n\nDue to the success of the attraction at [[Disneyland]], the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction was later constructed in [[Magic Kingdom]], [[Tokyo Disneyland]], and [[Disneyland Paris]] where it features the same scene with the helmsman.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===[[Pirates of the Caribbean (ride)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]===\nThe helmsman was seen in the  [[Dead Man's Cove]] sequence where he is seen controlling a helm hence his name on a stormy sea located on Hurricane Lagoon before guests pass through the [[The Crew of the Wicked Wench|Crew]]'s Quarters.\n\nIn [[Walt Disney World]], the helmsman is found nearby the [[Talking Skull]] before guests go over a waterfall and into the golden-age of piracy. When the skull's eyes flash red they are taking a photo of guests in-front of the helmsman which can be obtained after the ride ends. In Disneyland Paris, the helmsman is seen alongside an undead [[Captain Barbossa]] who chuckles and slashes at guests at they pass by the beached vessel.\n\n===[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Battle for the Sunken Treasure|Battle for the Sunken Treasure]]===\nThe scene where the riders pass through Hurricane Harbor was recreated and redesigned where the helmsman transforms into [[Jack Sparrow]].\n\n==Other Appearances==\n\n====Video games====\n\n===[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (video game)|Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]===\nIn the [[Davy Jones]]'[[Davy Jones' Locker| Locker]] segment of this video-game, one of the damned sailors is a skeleton helmsman who disappears when encountered by Jack.\n\n===[[Kinect Disneyland Adventures]]===\nThe helmsman is one of the skeleton enemies in the Dead Man's Cove level of this video-game, attacking the player and [[Black Barty]]. The helmsman is seen in the cutscene introducing the skeletons and has the difference in adaptation of having a hook-hand.\n\n===[[Disney Crossy Road]]===\nThe Skeleton Helmsman is a playable character in this movie game. His model has him permanently standing on a wooden platform while holding a helm as ''[[Yo Ho (A Pirate's Life for Me)]]'' plays.\n\n==Trivia==\n*While the helmsman himself never appeared in any of the film series, he was featured in the first official poster for ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]''.\n**Also, [[Terry Rossio]]'s original script included a skeleton helmsman in ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales]]'' controlling the ''Abyss'', a sunken ship whereas in the final film, the character was cut in the final version.\n*Originally, the helmsman was to have dialogue play for his scene, recorded by [[Paul Frees]], about his braving through the storm. According to this cut dialogue, the ship he was steering contained the Royal Fortune and was headed for the Spanish Main. The Royal Fortune being the name historically given to the ships of pirate [[Captain Gore|Captain Bartholomew Roberts]] who was featured in old scripts for the Pirates of the Caribbean.\n*During development of the original Pirates of the Caribbean before it become a log-flume attraction, the helmsman was named, \"Jolly Roger\" according to Marc Davis and Walt Disney. However, the helmsman was not given a proper name in recent merchandise inspired by the franchise. \"[[Jolly Roger]]\" would later be the name of the main villain in the discontinued video game ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean Online]]''.\n*It is sometimes theorized he might have been helmsman for the [[The Crew of the Wicked Wench|crew]] of the [[Wicked Wench]] due to their appearances as skeletons in the scene proceeding the helmsman's wreck. The truth to this remains a mystery.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nCOTBP Textless Poster 01.jpg|The official poster of ''The Curse of the Black Pearl'' depicting the helmsman\nSMK807799.jpg|The Helmsman's ''[[Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom]]'' spell card.\nDpw02934802934823.jpg|A plush of the helmsman from the Disney Wishables line\nPOTCRideOriginalTooLateToAlterCourseConceptArt.jpg\nMarc_Davis_Jolly_Roger.jpg\nGhost_ship.jpg\nMarchMagic2014CaribbeanPirates.jpg\nHelmsman-2017-08-29.png\nskeleton-helmsman.jpg\nskeleton-helmsman-1.jpg\nHelmsman1.jpg|An action-figure of the Helmsman from 2006\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*[http://pirates.fandom.com/wiki/Helmsman_(skeleton) Skeleton Helmsman] on [http://pirates.fandom.com/wiki Pirates of the Caribbean Wiki]\n\n{{Pirates of the Caribbean}}\n{{Disney Crossy Road}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Pirates of the Caribbean characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Skeletons]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Spell Cards characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Crossy Road characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Sailors]]\n[[Category:Kinect Disneyland Adventures characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
