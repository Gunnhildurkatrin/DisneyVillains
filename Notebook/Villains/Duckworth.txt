He worked for Scrooge even before the [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|nephews]] moved in. He's Scrooge's chauffeur and errand boy on occasion. Duckworth used to be Scrooge's only household servant until Scrooge hired [[Bentina Beakley|Mrs. Beakley]]. He also is the servant of the house.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nDuckworth is sane, devoted, and graceful and even loyal. He is always on the job, which also indicates how responsible he is. He is well-known for having no nonsense about him. Indeed, he knows nothing of greed and takes pleasure in helping others.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[DuckTales]]''===\nDuckworth usually appears as a supporting character in the episodes of DuckTales. His only starring roles on the show were in the episodes \"[[Duckworth's Revolt]]\" and \"[[Take Me Out of the Ballgame (DuckTales)|Take Me Out of the Ballgame]]\". In these two episodes, he shows he's a capable leader and his out of the box thinking comes in handy, whether its helping Doofus hit a baseball or steering a flying saucer that is out of the latter's control.\n\nDuckworth is a jack-of-all-trades in the [[McDuck Manor|McDuck mansion]], making him an important member of Scrooge's staff. He is happiest when he's helping someone and has no real interest in going out in the world to seek his own fortune.\n\n===[[DuckTales (2017 series)|''DuckTales'' (2017)]]===\nDuckworth makes his return\u00a0in the reboot\u00a0series\u00a0in the episode \"[[McMystery at McDuck McManor!]]\". According to [[Webby Vanderquack|Webby]], Duckworth died some years before the start of the series, and [[Scrooge McDuck|Scrooge]] has never had an actual birthday celebration since. When [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|Huey]] puts on a birthday party for Scrooge, the entertainer [[Beagle Boys|Black Arts Beagle]] tries to summon a demon, who turns out to be the ghost of Duckworth. Seeing that McDuck manor is infested by Scrooge's enemies (who were actually guests which [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|Louie]] invited, as he only had one hour to prepare), Duckworth takes Scrooge to the safe room, ejects the enemies from the manor, and spooks Huey, Dewey, and\u00a0Louie to teach them a lesson about forcing Scrooge into the party. When the triplets learn about this, Huey tries to apologize, but Scrooge assures him that\u00a0it had at least\u00a0reunited him with Duckworth, who remains in the mansion in his ghostly form.\n\nDuckworth has a rivalry with [[Bentina Beakley|Mrs. Beakley]], constantly calling her out on her housekeeping skills and ability to maintain peace at McDuck manor. Mrs. Beakley is shown to openly detest Duckworth, frequently expressing her displeasure at his ghostly return.\n\nDue to his ghostly status and intangibility, Duckworth is incapable of acting as Scrooge's butler as he once did but instead acts as a guardian to McDuck manor by assuming his demonic form.\n\nAt the end of \"[[The Last Crash of the Sunchaser!]]\", Duckworth is seen leaving McDuck Manor along with Beakley and Webby, clearly disappointed with Scrooge for his behavior towards [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|Huey, Dewey and Louie]] over the disappearance of [[Della Duck]].\n\nIn \"[[Nothing Can Stop Della Duck!]]\", it is revealed that Duckworth was still alive by the time of Della's disappearance.\n\nIn \"[[The First Adventure!]]\", he appears to be very much alive in this episode (due to its flashback) and helps Scrooge with his corporative situations, such as reschedule all of Scrooge's meeting, due to Scrooge having to a important mission for S.H.U.S.H. and having to also look after his [[Donald Duck|nephew]] and [[Della Duck|niece]] at the same time.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Although Duckworth did not appear in the [[Carl Barks]] comics on which the TV series was based, Scrooge did have various irregularly appearing similar butlers in these stories, who went by such names as \"Edgerton\" and \"Jarvis\".<ref>[http://www.cbarks.dk/thebutlers.htm The Butlers]</ref> However, there was not one consistent butler, and none of them appeared more than once.\n*In the Dutch dub of the [[1987]] TV special ''[[Sport Goofy in Soccermania]]'', Scrooge's butler (who was called \"Jeeves\" in the original version) was dubbed \"Van Stoetenwolf\", Duckworth's official Dutch name.\n*Duckworth is the demon that appears in the introduction of the 2017 ''Ducktales'' reboot, though his identity is not revealed in the introduction following his premiere episode.\n*In the finale of the 2017 ''Ducktales'' reboot, it is implied that Bradford may have killed Duckworth in an attempt to isolate Scrooge.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DuckTales}}\n[[fi:Ankenstr\u00f6m]]\n[[it:Archie (Disney)]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:DuckTales characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Servants]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Spirits]]\n[[Category:Shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]"
