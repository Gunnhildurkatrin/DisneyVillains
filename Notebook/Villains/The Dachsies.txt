'''The Dachsies''', are characters from Disney's ''[[The Ugly Dachshund]]''. They are a family of four Dachshunds belonging to [[Mark Garrison|Mark]] and [[Fran Garrison]]. '''Danke''', wearing a black collar, is the mother of three puppies: '''Wilhelmina''' (yellow collar), '''Heidi''' (red collar), and '''Chloe''' (blue collar). Of all 4 Dachsies, Chloe is Fran's second favorite one; the first being Danke before the pups' birth. They are also [[Brutus]] the Great Dane's foster family.\n\nThe Dachsies (minus Danke) often lead Brutus into many troubles, knowing that they will always be proclaimed to be innocent, leaving their adoptive brother to be blamed. An example of this is when the girls string out all the yarn and Brutus trips over it, causing a huge mess.\n\n==Role in the film==\n{{Stubsection}}\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Wilhelmina, Heidi, and Chloe being able to be recognized by the color of their collars is similar to identify [[Annette, Collette, and Danielle]] from ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]''.\n**However, Wilhelmina's collar is yellow while Danielle's collar is white.\n**They also resemble their respective mothers.\n*In the movie, it is unknown which Dachshund was Danke's husband and the pups' father the same way it is unknown which and what kind of cat was [[Duchess]]' husband and the kittens' father before [[Thomas O'Malley|O'Malley]] became the new member of the family from ''[[The Aristocats]]''. Though it is possible a stud service was used.\n*Danke means \"Thank you\", Wilhelmina means \"willing to protect\", and Heidi means \"Nobility\" in German. Chloe means \"Green shoot\" in Greek.\n*Chloe's original name was Clotilde. However, it is unknown if Chloe is just a nickname for Clotilde in the movie, which means \"Heroine\" in German.\n*Dachsies can\u00a0 also be spelled Doxies, depending on the person.\n\n{{The Ugly Dachshund}}\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dachsies}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:The Ugly Dachshund characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]"
