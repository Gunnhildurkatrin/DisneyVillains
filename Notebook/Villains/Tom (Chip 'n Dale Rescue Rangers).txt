[[Gadget Hackwrench|Gadget]] took pity on him and believed that Tom could be friendly with the proper reprogramming. She believed that Dale's video game cartridge would do the job.\n\nHowever, Fat Cat and his thugs had other ideas for the galvanized feline. Fat Cat managed to get ahold of Tom and replaced Dale's cartridge with a fighting game. After a struggle, Dale managed to eject the war game and the mechanical cat shut down.\n\nLater, Tom was reactivated with Dale's game cartridge and given to a boy who'd wanted a cat but his father was against the idea (due to his beloved pet fish and the fact he was allergic to cat's fur) but gave in for his son's happiness and even gave Tom his toupee to mimic fur as he wasn't allergic to it.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nb_26-TomSwitch1_yes.jpg\nb_26-DaleLip1_brown.jpg\nb_26-TomWhiskers_no.jpg\nb_26-GadgetDaleDance.jpg\nredeyedrobocat.jpg|Tom under the influence of the war game.\nb_26-TomSwitch3_yes.jpg\n1383858525_00-15-48.jpg\nl_7b8a1982.jpg\nS_26_wrgm.jpg\nb_26-TomSwitch5_yes.jpg\nb_26-TomCat1_off.jpg|Tom shorted out.\nb_26-TomCat4_off.jpg|Tom has rescued Luna.\nfriendlyrobocat.jpg\nRR - s2603.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Rescue Rangers}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Tom}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers characters]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Character stubs]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
