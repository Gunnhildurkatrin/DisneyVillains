Along with [[Gregoria]], he helps take care of and guide [[Vampirina Hauntley]] when her parents are away and usually tags along on her adventures. However, he is also rather clumsy and forgetful, which can sometimes cause or escalate the problems Vee is facing, though he has come up with solutions in some situations.\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nDemi.jpeg\nDemi plush.jpg|Demi plush\n2D Vee & Demi.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Vampirina}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Character stubs]]\n[[Category:Vampirina characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Spirits]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Frogs]]"
