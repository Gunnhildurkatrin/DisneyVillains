He then became the new Timberwolves basketball coach after [[Coach Barker]] was fired and did not appreciate any bad sportsmanship and [[Larry Willingham|Larry]] showing off.\n\nAs the new basketball coach, Chaney starts implementing changes in the team, including benching Larry during a game for constant ball-hogging. Angry by Chaney's decision, [[Buck Willingham]], Larry's overbearing father, forces Larry to leave the team.\u00a0\n\nDuring the court custody, Coach Chaney suggested [[Judge Cranfield]], whom is a fan of Chaney, decide that [[Buddy]] will choose who will be his rightful owner.\n\n{{Air Bud}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Air Bud characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Coaches]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Air Bud]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Engineers]]"
