In [[Disneyland Paris]], he is joined by another goat chewing on a clothesline. Billy is central to a [[Disneyland]] guest past time known as the \"Goat Trick\", where turning your head to stare back at the goat as you drop results in feeling a greater sense of disorientation.\n\n=== [[Jessie's Critter Carousel]] ===\nA cartoonish depiction of the goat appears in the art for this attraction in [[Pixar Pier]]. It is made to resemble one of the animals from [[Woody's Roundup]] and has a fleecy hide like a ram and is chewing dynamite atop a butte.\n\n== Other Appearances ==\n\n=== Television ===\n\n==== [[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]] ====\nThe Disney Goat makes a cameo in the \"[[Nature's Wonderland]]\" episode of ''Mickey Mouse'', which homages [[Mine Train Through Nature's Wonderland]].\n\n=== Online Media ===\n\n==== Free the Disney Goat ====\n[[File:Goat Puppet Epcot.jpg|thumb|250x250px|Billy enjoying a taste of freedom at [[Epcot]] at the end of the Free the Disney Goat campaign.]]\nIn the Spring of 2013, Disney launched the \"Free the Disney Goat\" marketing campaign for Walt Disney World. In a video, a puppet version of the Goat implored viewers to petition Disney to allow him some time off to explore the resort with the hashtag #FreeTheDisneyGoat and a website featuring the Goat's drawings imagining himself riding other attractions.\n\n==== WDW Best Day Ever ====\nAfter the campaign ended, the Goat puppet would later appear in a 2015-2016 YouTube series on Disney's \"WDW Best Day Ever\" channel titled \"Walt Disney World Goat Friends\", where he would comically interview other animatronic figures across the resort, usually obscure characters.\n\n=== Printed Materials ===\n\n==== [[Disney Kingdoms]] ====\nThe iconic image of Billy chewing on dynamite has been referenced in the [[Disney Kingdoms: Big Thunder Mountain Railroad]] comic.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nBTMR Goat on Mickey Mouse.jpg|Character design for ''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]''\nGoatBTMRComic.jpg|In [[Disney Kingdoms]]\ngoat-big-thunder-mountain-railroad.jpg|The goat's [[vinylmation]]\n</gallery>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Posters put around Big Thunder during refurbishments show illustrations of Billy with a warning that the goats are an invasive species in the mountain's ecosystem.\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://twitter.com/disneygoat Twitter Account] for the Free the Disney Goat campaign.\n* [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtH8SWNY0bjIjXc2TFtUrBZeOJiziTWxO WDW Goat Friends] Playlist{{Big Thunder Mountain Railroad}}\n\n{{Disney Kingdoms}}\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Goats]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse (TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Big Thunder Mountain Railroad Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Kingdoms characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
