He sometimes appears in other outfits, such as a pirate costume in\u00a0the episode \"[[All Washed Up]]\" and winter clothes in \"[[Chilly Gets Chilly]]\".\n\n===Personality===\nWhile being brave and intelligent sometimes, Stuffy is rather clumsy but he doesn't always trip and fall successfully. Whenever he\u00a0does it, everyone often\u00a0laughs at him. But when Stuffy causes a frequent\u00a0accident during a patient's check-up or at any time, he seems loyal and truthful to [[Doc McStuffins (character)|Doc]] or anyone else.\n\n==Role in the Series==\nStuffy is a stuffed blue dragon who always tries his best to be the bravest dragon of all. He unexpectedly hurts himself when [[Doc McStuffins (character)|Doc]] and the toys are playing a game in the episodes \"[[The Right Stuff]]\" and \"[[Un-Bur-Able]]\". Stuffy says he isn't afraid of anything (except spiders), and when he tells himself he is brave, a noise startles him.\n\nStuffy's favorite game is protecting castles from monsters and brave knights. He dislikes tea parties until he is part of it in the episode \"[[Tea Party Tantrum]]\" when Doc and [[Lambie]] laugh at him for sipping from his teacup loudly. Also, in the episode \"All Washed Up\", Stuffy and Lambie are pretending to be pirates in the game \"Find the Hidden Treasure\" (because of this, Stuffy is dressed as a pirate in the said game).\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*While busy working on\u00a0''[[The Doc Files]]\u00a0''TV series,\u00a0[[Robbie Rist]] was unable to voice Stuffy, so [[Ben Schwartz]] had to fill in for him.\n*When Stuffy tells himself he is brave, he does not succeed at that when something scares him.\n*Stuffy is the first toy to adopt a toy pet as his own.\n*In \"[[Bringing Home Baby]]\", it is revealed that Stuffy was given to Doc by her parents on Halloween night.\n*Stuffy's design is based on ''[[The Reluctant Dragon]]'' film from [[1941]].\n*Stuffy's voice actor, Robbie Rist, also voices Starr in\u00a0''Balto'', Brian Daily in\u00a0''Batman: The Animated Series'', Kevin in\u00a0''Godzilla: The Series'', Wiz in\u00a0''Kidd Video'', Lamarr in\u00a0''The Adventures of Puss in Boots'', Itsuki in the Tokyopop dub of\u00a0''Initial D'',\u00a0[[Thompson Overman]] in\u00a0''[[The Weekenders]]'', Mondo Gecko in\u00a0''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'', Choji in the English dubs of\u00a0''Naruto\u00a0''and\u00a0''Naruto Shippuden'', Swelter and Tricerashot in ''Transformers: Robots in Disguise'',\u00a0and Maroda in the Final Fantasy video games.\u00a0\n\n{{Doc McStuffins}}\n[[Category:Dragons]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Toys]]\n[[Category:Doc McStuffins characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
