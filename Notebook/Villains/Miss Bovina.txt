In this comic, she has a party in [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]]'s home, where Mickey's twin nephews Morty and Ferdie keep annoying Mickey throughout the night.\nLater, in ''Goofy's Hallowe'en'' (an illustrated text story from Walt Disney's Comics & Stories #38), she has another party. Goofy thinks he isn't invited (his invitation was still in his mailbox), and decides to learn proper etiquette. Miss Bovina had a major role in this comic.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bovina}}\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Aunts]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Cattle]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
