She is Wyatt's sister.\n\n==Biography==\nTBA\n\n==Appearance==\nWilla has long, dark, bushy curls of hair with several white streaks. She wears combat boots and a long leather jacket. As the rest of her pack, she wears a Moonstone Necklace around her neck that enhances her abilities. She also has dark skin and a wicked smile with pointed, but human-like teeth. \n\n==Background Information==\n\n===Personality===\nWilla is the Alpha werewolf and the leader of the pack which makes her a strong leader and extremely protective. She is also very serious, fierce, and won't let anyone or anything disrespect her or her pack.\n\nWilla is extremely loyal to her pack, her brother, and Wynter. She is a strong and confident force to be reckoned with and is a bit more violent than her brother, Wynter or her other pack mates. She is very resourceful. \n\n==Powers & Abilities==\nEnhanced her powers with the necklace all werewolves wear that came from the moonstone with that, it can make the werewolf kind live and be healthy.\n\nThe powers of the necklaces give them, the Werewolves, infinite strength, which measures to the strength of a Zombie, if not stronger, and will make them formidable in combat or in a situation that threatens them.\n\n==Relationships==\n\n===Wyatt===\nWyatt is Willa's brother. They argue a bit in the second Z-O-M-B-I-E-S film, but ultimately are always there for one another, and there to defend the other werewolves in any situation.\n\n===Wynter===\nWynter is Willa's packmate and best friend, and Wynter always follows Willa's directions, or asks for clarification on something tough. They get along well.\n\n===Addison===\nAddison and Willa are put at odds, more or less with Willa leaving with snarky comments. But, by the end of ''[[Zombies 2]]'', the girls are friends and very close ones, at that.\n\n===Eliza===\nHer and Eliza barely exchange comments, but when they do, they seem very close. Willa calls Eliza smart and intelligent many times in the short series, and Eliza now stands behind Willa in risky situations.\n\n===Zed===\nZed and Willa's relationship is mutual. They can be kind to one another, but from time to time, they do argue, and quit, with the involvement of Addison.\n\n===Bucky===\nWilla seems to be the \"Alpha\" of her and Bucky's relationship. But, she does show how sensitive she is around Bucky from one time to another.\n\n===Vanna===\nVanna and Willa were long time enemies, and both were stubborn at at one another's throats. But, by the end of season 2, they both learned to accept one another and became close friends.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Before Addison was discovered by the Werewolves, Willa was the leader of the pack. After Addison was found not to be the Great Alpha, she became the leader once more.\n*Willa is very fierce, and stands up constantly for her pack, and for herself, respectively.\n*Willa will do whatever it takes to feed and care for the people she loves.\n*She may seem rude at times, and a little too fierce, but she is very loyal and kind, deep down.\n*The last name Lykensen is derived from the word \"lyken\", a term used for humanoid wolves.\n*Willa's necklace proves to be the most powerful out of her pack, and is very useful.\n*Without her Moonstone, Willa is a powerful foe to stand against.\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Werecreatures]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel Original Movie Characters]]\n[[Category:Z-O-M-B-I-E-S characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]"
