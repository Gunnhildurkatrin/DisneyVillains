Spotting this, the waiter initially was about to tell Donald that he couldn't eat his lunch in his restaurant, but decides to overcharge him with $35.99, which Donald couldn't pay, as he had only a nickel at the moment, thus deciding to demand Donald to the court. Ultimately, he wins the cases, and laughs evily when he hears the judge forcing Donald between pay a ten dollar fee, spending ten days washing dishes in his restaurant or going to prison, however, his glee soon dissapears after Donald accepts working in his restaurant and destroys his plates on purpose while \"washing\" them. Pierre pleads with Donald to stop it, and even offers to drop the charges in return, but Donald won't have it, reminding him what the judge said and continuing destroying his dishes, much to his horror.\n\n==Life Skill(s)==\n\n*Outside food and beverages are strictly forbidden to bring inside a fancy restaurant.\n*By far, a waiter/waitress charging a customer for his/her outside food and beverages (other than asking him/her to leave the premises) is not the way how a restaurant should be run.\n*Generally, the customer is always right.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"151\">\n46107.jpg\n1948-trial-3.jpg\nTumblr nnuj8jLGxm1r3jmn6o4 1280.png\nTumblr nkwrq6UtOW1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\n46110.jpg\nTumblr nnuiuppwjT1r3jmn6o1 1280.png\n46111.jpg\n46112.jpg\nTumblr nnuj8jLGxm1r3jmn6o8 1280.png\n46114.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:French characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Stub]]"
