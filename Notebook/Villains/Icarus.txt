Someone who can put at the epicenter of the Academy's chic Greek elite.|Icarus}}'''Icarus''' is a major character from the Disney animated series ''[[Hercules (TV series)|Hercules]]''. He was [[Hercules (character)|Hercules]]' best friend during their time in [[Prometheus Academy]]. He also has a romantic obsession with his friend, [[Cassandra (Hercules)|Cassandra]].\n\n==Background==\nIcarus was born and raised in Athens and comes from a wealthy family with his father, Daedalus, as a famous inventor and his mother with a highly successful pottery making business. Despite his wealth, Icarus is a kind, caring, friendly, hyper, fun-loving and eccentric individual.\n\nIcarus refers to his father as \"Dadalus\" and his mother as \"Momalus\". At some point in his life, his parents amicably divorced, with his mother relocating to Ithaca while he remained in Athens with his father. Icarus maintains a very close relationship with both his parents and regularly spends his summers working with his mother. Despite their divorce, however, Icarus refuses to acknowledge or accept it, believing that despite their separation, his parents still love each other.\n\nSimiliar to his father, Icarus takes interest in inventing as prior to the series, he and his father created wax wings allowing him to fly. Unfortunately, Icarus carelessly flew too close to the sun, which nonfatally immolated him and caused him to crash, an act he has since become well known for. Icarus is also hopelessly head-over-heels in love with his friend, Cassandra, whom he considers his girlfriend, despite his feelings clearly being one-sided.\n\n===Personality===\nThe incident involving flying too close to the Sun fried Icarus' brain, leaving him batty but lovable. Despite being an easy-going and good-natured man, Icarus is quick to anger and driven to great acts of spite at the slightest provocation, particularly when consumed by jealousy. While deeply respectful of his self-declared best friend Hercules, Icarus is not above using the Demigod's super strength to his own advantage, and will at times stop at nothing to make himself appear more capable than he genuinely is.\n\nIcarus' encounter with the Sun has resulted in a number of behavioral oddities, such as sudden bouts of screaming and hyperactive fits when trying to prove a point or terrified. He also has little to no sense of social etiquette, though believes himself to be a ladies man.\n\n==Role in the [[Hercules (TV series)|series]]==\nIn the clip-show episode \"[[Hercules and the Yearbook]]\", Phil tells that after graduation, Icarus went into manufacturing with his father, Daedelus, and became very wealthy, earning the name \"Icarus: The Wax-Wing King\". In \"[[Hercules and the Arabian Night]]\", he gets kidnapped by [[Jafar]] and teams up with [[Abu]] to stop him and Hades. Icarus then wants a monkey after he waves goodbye to Abu.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Icarus was created specifically for the ''Hercules'' animated TV show.\n*In the animated series, Icarus' accident is implied (and portrayed in the opening) as catching aflame as a result of flying too close to the Sun, immolating him and causing brain damage, resulting in his hyperactive behavior and burnt appearance. In actual Greek Mythology, after escaping his confines using the wax wings developed by his father Daedalus, Icarus ignored his father's warnings and flew too close to the sun, the heat of which caused his wax wings to melt and break apart, causing him to plummet into the sea and resulting in his death. This is contradicted in \"[[Hercules and the Romans]]\", where Icarus accidentally flies too close to the Sun leading to his wax wings melting, during which he screams \"OH MAN, NOT AGAIN\" before plummeting, suggesting his initial accident was similar to Mythology rather than being immolated.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Promotional===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nHercfaceoff.jpg\nHercsGang.jpg\nHerctrio.jpg\nHadechase.jpg\nHercules ToonDisney.jpg\nIck official.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Stock art===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nclipics.gif|Icarus\n</gallery>\n\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nhadesandick.gif|Icarus with Hades\nTapestry of Fate02.gif\nTapestry of Fate06.gif\nCasic2.jpg\nDisney's Hercules - Hercules and the Apollo Mission - Hercules and Icarus.jpg\nHercules The Animated Series icarus.jpg\nIcarus-Hercules and the Drama Festival.gif\nFlounderCameo.jpg\nHatan90.jpg\nAbu & Icarus - Hercules and the Arabian Night02.png\nAbu & Icarus - Hercules and the Arabian Night01.png\nHades-Hercules and The Drama Festival10.jpg\nHades-Hercules and The Drama Festival09.jpg\nHades-Hercules and The Drama Festival08.jpg\nHades-Hercules and The Drama Festival07.jpg\nAphroditeHerc&Icarus-Hercules and the Dream Date.jpg\nHelen&Icarus-Hercules and The Trojan War.gif\nAdonis-Hercules and The Visit From Zeus07.jpg\nIcarus Diapered 3.png\nHercules and the Yearbook (25).png\nHercules and the Yearbook (23).png\nHercules and the Dream Date (7).jpg\nHercules and the Arabian Night (11).png\nHercules and the Yearbook (47).jpg\nHercules and the Prometheus Affair (77).jpg\nHercules and the Dream Date (1).jpg\nHercules and the Big Sink (11).jpg\nHercules and the Big Sink (10).jpg\nHercules and the Big Sink (8).jpg\nHercules and the Big Sink (5).jpg\nHercules and the Parent's Weekend (8).jpg\nHercules and the Parent's Weekend (7).jpg\nHercules and the Parent's Weekend (6).jpg\nHercules and the Parent's Weekend (1).jpg\nHercules and the Parent's Weekend (29).jpg\nHercules and the Parent's Weekend (12).jpg\nHercules and the Parent's Weekend (10).jpg\nHercules and the Parent's Weekend (9).jpg\nHercules and the Green-Eyed Monster (15).jpg\nHercules and the Green-Eyed Monster (12).jpg\nHercules and the Green-Eyed Monster (11).jpg\nHercules and the Green-Eyed Monster (10).jpg\nHercules and the Green-Eyed Monster (9).jpg\nHercules and the Green-Eyed Monster (7).jpg\nHercules and the Green-Eyed Monster (5).jpg\nHercules and the Green-Eyed Monster (4).jpg\nHercules and the Green-Eyed Monster (3).jpg\nHercules and the Green-Eyed Monster (2).jpg\nHercules and the Green-Eyed Monster (1).jpg\nHercules and the Parent's Weekend (32).jpg\nHercules and the Parent's Weekend (31).jpg\nHercules and the Big Sink (17).jpg\nHercules and the Big Sink (15).jpg\nHercules and the Big Sink (14).jpg\nHercules and the Big Sink (13).jpg\nHercules and the Big Sink (12).jpg\nIcarus - Hercules The Series Opening.jpg\nHercules and the Green-Eyed Monster (23).jpg\nHercules and the Green-Eyed Monster (22).jpg\nHercules and the Green-Eyed Monster (21).jpg\nHercules and the Green-Eyed Monster (20).jpg\nHercules and the Green-Eyed Monster (18).jpg\nHercules and the Green-Eyed Monster (17).jpg\nIcarus Dopey.png|Icarus as [[Dopey]]\n</gallery>\n\n{{Hercules}}\n[[Category:Hercules characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Greek Mythology]]\n[[Category:Inventors]]\n[[Category:Greek characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Historical characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Sidekicks]]"
