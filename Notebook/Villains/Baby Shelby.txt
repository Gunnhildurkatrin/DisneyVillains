However, [[Donald Duck|Donald]] is the photographer and matches wits with Shelby. Shelby would later go on to star as an adversary for the duck much like [[Chip and Dale]] or his nephews. Shelby also went on with [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Goofy]] in the cartoon \"[[Babysitters]]\".\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\nShelby is often seen causing trouble for [[Donald Duck]], or rare to [[Mickey Mouse]]. He doesn't speak, but he is famous for his trademark laugh. He also can speak in thought as seen in \"[[Donald's Pool]]\". Shelby's mother, [[Mrs. Turtle]], is overprotective of her son and will often yell if she can't find him, or if she gives someone an order.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Baby Shelby resembles a child turtle in the Pluto cartoon \"[[Pluto's Surprise Package]]\". It could be possible that this is in fact the \"prototype\" Shelby as they look exactly alike with different color schemes.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nChar 29967.jpg\nShelby.jpg\nChar 67591 thumb.jpg\n0800251abec7fc0f4da9be6bd7a4d116UJyRKf4G.jpg\nE51a3290c-1.jpg\n2002-tousenboiteS3-17-00.jpg\n2002-tousenboiteS3-16-03.jpg\nShelby .jpg\n2000mikeymanias30503.jpg\nBaby Shelby stage fright.png\nDonald Shelby HM.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{House of Mouse}}\n{{Mickey Mouse Works}}\n{{Mickey Mouse & Friends}}\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Turtles]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse Works characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Infants]]\n[[Category:Toddlers]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]"
