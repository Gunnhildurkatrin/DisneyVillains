He is an exact physical copy of Donald, but with far more urbane manners and eloquent speech. Fearing that he will lose Daisy after a heated argument, Donald wanders through the streets to figure out a solution when he meets his look-alike, whom he offers money to impersonate him in order to win back Daisy's heart.\n\nThe plan goes awry when the look-alike starts falling for Daisy, which incurs Donald's wrath and jealousy. For the rest of the date, Donald tries everything to prevent them from getting closer, and win back Daisy himself.\n\nNotably, with his Ronald Coleman type voice, this is the type of duck that in ''[[Donald's Diary]]'' Donald envisions himself to be, and briefly adopts this voice in [[Donald's Dream Voice|''Donald's Dream Voice'']]''.''\n\nThe character didn't have an actual name until the [[2018]] series ''[[Legend of the Three Caballeros]]'', in which he is named Dapper Duck.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nDonald's Double Trouble Dapper swoon.jpg\nDonald's Double Trouble - Dapper Duck.jpg\nDonald's Double Trouble Donald and Dapper.jpg\nDonald's Double Trouble Dapper and Daisy.jpg\nDaisy and Dapper Duck.png|In ''[[Legend of the Three Caballeros]]''\n</gallery>\n\n{{Saludos Amigos/The Three Caballeros}}\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:The Three Caballeros characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]"
