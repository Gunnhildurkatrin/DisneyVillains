He is a soldier from the game ''[[Hero's Duty]]''.\n\n==Background==\n===Development===\nMarkowski evolved from a character in earlier drafts named '''Bobby Dunderson''', a soldier that went against the program and wished to game-jump to a game called ''Extreme EZ Livin' 2''. Ralph encountered Dunderson during the former's imprisomiment in ''Hero's Duty'' and sparked something of a friendship (though Dunderson, in truth, wanted to use Ralph\" strengths as a means escape their cell.\n\n==Role in the film==\nOne of the few named troops in the film, Markowski has a brief, yet fairly significant role in the film. He is first seen in ''Tapper's'', mindlessly walking through the halls, repeating \"We are humanity's last hope. Our mission's to destroy all Cy-Bugs.\" in a very dry tone until Ralph approaches him, causing him to snap and complain about the horrors of fighting the vicious Cy-Bugs day in and day out, despite the fact that ''Hero's Duty'' was only plugged in for a week. Markowski then states that it's all for a medal, which catches Ralph's attention. The bad-guy, wanting to be treated as a hero, asks Markowski if he could enter ''Hero's Duty'' and win a medal, but Markowski denies saying \"Only the bravest and the best serve in our corps!\" before panicking at the sight of a [[Hal|cockroach]] on Ralph's shoulder, accidentally running right into a wall. The unconscious Markowski was then trapped in a storage closet by Ralph and his armor was stolen, giving the bad-guy a disguise to enter ''Hero's Duty''.\n\nDuring gameplay, Ralph fumbles throughout the level, much to [[Sergeant Calhoun]]'s frustration. With the troops being identified by their armor, Calhoun mistakes Ralph for Markowski and berates his incompetence. The other men (having fell for the disguise as well) also joke at \"Markowski\"'s expense. Markowski is seen again at the end of the film during Sergeant Calhoun and Felix's wedding.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nMarkowski ALL.jpg|Markowski concept art\nMarkowskiComic2.png\nWreck-it-ralph-markowski-3.jpg\nWreckitralph 4269.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Wreck-It Ralph}}\n[[Category:Wreck-It Ralph characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Military characters]]\n[[Category:Soldiers]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
