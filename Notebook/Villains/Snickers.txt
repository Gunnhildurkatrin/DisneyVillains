Best part of the day.|Snickers}}\n\n'''Snickers''' is a supporting character in the [[2020]] [[Disney+]] film, ''[[The One and Only Ivan]]''. She is a circus spoiled poodle working in the Big Top Mall, [[Stella the Elephant|Stella]]'s partner and one of [[Ivan the Gorilla|Ivan]]'s friends. Of all the animals, she is the one who really appreciates this kind of life.\n\n== Personality ==\n{{Quote|'''Snickers''': But I wouldn't last two minutes in the wild.<br>'''Bob''': Why?<br>'''Snickers''': Well... there are no blow-dryers.|Snickers to Bob about her inability to live in wild.}}\nSnickers is easily the easiest animal of the Big Top Mall, particularly enjoying the cheering crowd and considering the best time of day to be during his performance. She also finds domestic life quite good but that can make her rather superficial because she didn't think she could stay in nature for a moment due to the lack of hair dryer, showing that she cares about her appearance.\n\nOn the social side, Snickers is very open-minded, tolerating [[Bob the Dog|Bob]]'s opportunistic habit with whom she gets along quite well despite their different points of view, Bob refusing domestic life because he wants to remain free while Snickers finds the rather miserable vagabond life. She's also full of common sense, deciding not to share bad news if it causes annoyance, although it didn't bother her when Bob yelled at all over the roof seconds after promised not to talk about it, only amused by his incorrigibility. While not shown, Snickers was probably just as saddened as the others upon learning of Stella's passing.\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n=== ''[[The One and Only Ivan]]'' ===\nSnickers is first seen performing her quotient number by climbing onto Stella's head and then standing up when the female elephant does the same.\n\nAs the days go by and the public grows rarer and rarer, Snickers isn't too worried, being still fed and pampered by Mack. One day, Mack receives a call that thrills him, attracting the curiosity of Snickers who follows the human. She returns shortly after to the office where she surprises Bob about to eat her kibble but instead of annoyed, she just comments that he would need a bath before questioning him about his refusal to accept domesticated life. When Bob recalls that he has to encourage Ivan, Snickers informs him that today's performance has been canceled due to a newcomer arriving, while asking him not to tell the others to avoid them are upset but the street dog starts shouting it to everyone afterwards, to the amusement of the poodle.\n\nThe newcomer, Ruby, does not take long to bring people back to the marquee but Stella's health deteriorates more and more and she ends up dead, to the great sadness of the other animals. Meanwhile, [[Ivan the Gorilla|Ivan]] made the promise to Stella to offer freedom to Ruby so one evening, he frees the little elephant then the other boarders but Snickers does not follow them for the wild. After the natural getaway turns out to be unsuccessful, life resumes its courtship for everyone until Ivan uses his artistic talents to paint his desire for liberation, creating a wave of protest for the gorilla's release.\n\nMack eventually gives in and closes the Big Top Mall, sending all the exotic performers to other places while Snickers is the only one staying with Mack.\n\n== Trivia ==\n\n* According to Ivan, Snickers brings a touch of elegance to the show.\n* At the end of the film, Bob ends up being adopted by Julia, probably inspired by Snickers.\n{{The One and Only Ivan}}\n[[Category:The One and Only Ivan characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Circus performers]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Pets]]"
