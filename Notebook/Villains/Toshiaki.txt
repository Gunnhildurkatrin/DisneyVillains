He is a scientific rival of [[Victor Frankenstein]].\n\n==Description==\nToshiaki is over-achieving and mega-competitive. He is 12-years old. He delights in beating Victor at his own game and like a power-hungry mad scientist, Toshiaki will stop at nothing to win the top prize in the school\u2019s science fair\u2014even if it means stealing Victor\u2019s ideas to do it.\n==Appearances==\n\n=== ''[[Frankenweenie]]''===\n==Trivia==\n\n*In the film, when Toshiaki revives his deceased pet turtle, Shelley, it mutates and grows to a horrific size. In this state, Shelley closely resembles popular Japanese [[wikipedia:Kaiju|Kaiju]] monster [[wikipedia:Gamera|Gamera]]. Additionally, the scene in which Shelley crushes a police car with its foot is a reference to the teaser trailer for the [[wikipedia:Godzilla (1998_film)|1998 ''Godzilla'' movie]], an American reboot of the popular [[wikipedia:Godzilla|Japanese ''Kaiju'' franchise]]. All of this is given further significance by the fact that Toshiaki is Japanese.\n*Toshiaki can be interpreted as a dark twist on the various child characters of Godzilla and Gamera films from the late 60s and early 70s, who often had a fondness for monsters and a deeper understanding of them compared to the adults. Gamera himself was billed as the \"Friend of All Children\" and protected them from other kaiju, so Shelley turning on Toshiaki is a possible subversion of that relationship.\n*Toshiaki is a 12-year old boy. He is younger than Nassor.\n\n==Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nToshiaki.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Frankenweenie}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Frankenweenie characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Japanese characters]]\n[[Category:Inventors]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]"
