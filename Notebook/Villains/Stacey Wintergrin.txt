Early on, she became the romantic interest of [[Arthur Spudinski|Spud]], who had become obsessed with trying to win her heart. Despite his affection, Stacey quickly runs, screaming in horror, at any physical contact or even friendly greetings made by him. However, Spud falls for one of [[Fury]]'s lies when she tells him that she wants to use her power to do good for the world, but in order to do so, she needs a bracelet that will restore her powers.<ref>[[Furious Jealousy]]</ref>\n\nAfterward, she apparently uses mind control to make Stacy like Spud (she begins to secretly see him while in public, pretending she still hates him). Spud soon realizes that Fury just used him to free her sisters and to permanently imprison [[Jake Long|Jake]] in stone and drop him in the Hudson River, and he helps save the day. Back at school, Spud tries to tell Stacey that it was okay if she dumped him for [[Nigel Thrall]], but she tells him that she likes him because he came up with a great idea for a dance to please her, and together they share a dance in the janitor's closet. Presumably, they continue to date in secret after this, now that Spud has finally won her over by himself.\n\nEventually, considering the fact that she's Spud's graduation partner, they are still dating and their relationship appears to be more public, as she clearly agreed to be his partner.<ref>[[Being Human]]</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{American Dragon: Jake Long}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wintergrin, Stacey}}\n[[Category:American Dragon: Jake Long characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Cheerleaders]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
