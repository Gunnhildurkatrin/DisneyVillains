As a huge fan and later apprentice of Mateo, she dresses a lot like him in similar robes, and dreams of someday becoming a great wizard like her idol.\n\n==Role in the [[Elena of Avalor|Series]]==\nOlivia and Mateo first met during a get together at the castle in \"[[Wizard-in-Training]]\". While her parents spoke with [[Princess Elena]] about fixing a dried up well, Mateo gave Olivia a personal tour of his workshop and tells her a little bit about being a wizard. At the same time Mateo decides to make Olivia her apprentice, much to her delight. Despite Elena's concerns, Mateo was certain he could handle teaching.\n\nOlivia's first day of apprenticeship, was learning basic alchemy. She does well with the first part with Mateo showing her, but when he leaves her with directions for the second part she decided to take some notes in her book instead of doing the alchemy. Once she tries to finish the alchemy it ends up turning into purple smoke. Olivia decided to help Mateo clean up his workshop, and while he left with Elena, She got called upon Lucas to help get their cat out of a tree. Going against Mateo's orders, Olivia took one of his tamboritas and went to help out.\n\nForgetting her spell book, she used one spell she remembered to get their cat down. After the family saw what she did they decided to let her help them out with the dry well. Olivia tried to get more water from the well, but instead created a huge water spirit. Working with Mateo, both Master and Apprentice chased down the Water spirit and together they froze the spirit which became snow.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"180\">\nWizard-in-Training 4.png\nWizard-in-Training 7.png\nWizard-in-Training 8.png\n</gallery>\n\n== Trivia ==\n*In the episode \"[[Team Isa]]\", Olivia reveals that her middle name is Madeline.{{Elena of Avalor}}\n[[Category:Wizards]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Elena of Avalor characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
