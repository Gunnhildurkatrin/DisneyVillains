They are a duo of porcupines living in the [[Pride Lands]].\n\n==Background==\nThe porcupine brothers are two identical unnamed porcupines, as their names suggest. One of them has large black eyes and a red nose, while the other one has large brown eyes and a black nose.\n\n==Role in the series==\n\n===Season 1===\nThe porcupine brothers first appeared in \"[[Bunga the Wise (episode)|Bunga the Wise]]\".\n\nWhen flood arrives at the Pride Lands, the porcupine brothers find their home, which is a log, destroyed, leading the Lion Guard to come to the rescue. Later, when [[Fuli]] asks [[Kion]] to know if there is anyone to help, he explains to her that he needs to help the porcupine brothers, which would be easier if he had [[Bunga]] to help while Kion asks [[Ono]] to find Bunga. Kion, Fuli, and [[Beshte]] roll a log down to get the water out of it so the porcupine brothers can return to rest to which the three were able to do so as the porcupine brothers thank them for fixing their home. After rescuing the porcupines, they are heard arguing over their quills due to the limited space they have inside their home.\n\nIn \"[[Beware the Zimwi]]\", two of the porcupine brothers listen to [[Rafiki]] telling a scary story about the Zimwi, a monster feared across the Pride Lands as the porcupines react in fear. After the story, the porcupines set off on their own just as the Lion Guard searches various parts of the Pride Lands to seek the mysterious Zimwi. Eventually, the group discovers that what they are facing are the porcupine brothers just as the two are mistaken for the Zimwi. The porcupines then explain that they left together due to the scary story of the Zimwi and that the termite mound had them appear taller than the duo. The Lion Guard then decides to stop investigating the Zimwi case.\n\n===Season 2===\nIn \"[[Timon and Pumbaa's Christmas]]\", the porcupine brothers participate during the musical number \"[[The Twelve Ways of Christmas]]\" during Christmas morning along with the other Pride Land animals celebrating Christmas. Unlike in Season 1, the porcupine brothers have a non-speaking cameo though they are only heard rehearsing and singing \"The Twelve Ways of Christmas\".\n\n==Trivia==\n*The Porcupine Brothers are voiced by different actors in \"[[Beware the Zimwi]]\", making them sound much younger compared to their first appearance.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://lionking.fandom.com/wiki/Porcupine_brothers Porcupine Brothers] on [http://lionking.fandom.com/wiki/ Lion King Wiki].\n\n{{The Lion King}}\n\n[[Category:The Lion Guard characters]]\n[[Category:Porcupines]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]"
