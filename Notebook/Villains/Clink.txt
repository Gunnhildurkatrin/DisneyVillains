'''Experiment 086''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]]. He\u00a0is designed to capture and confine enemies inside of him.\u00a0\n\n==Background==\n===Physical appearance===\nClink is a big, green mouthless crab-like experiment with two stalked, lime-green eyes, six legs, two large claws, and a container window on his chest.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nClink can trap his targets in the holding tank in his stomach by splitting in half and joining together again around the target in his holding cell tank in his stomach. When split, each half of Clink apparently has a separate mind.\n\n=== Weaknesses ===\nWhen tied up Clink loses control of his targets.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment 086 was the 86th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to capture and confine enemies in a holding tank in his stomach.086 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.\n\nIn \"[[Skip (episode)|Skip]]\", 086 was used to capture rogue experiments in an alternate future where [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]] ruled Earth. He captured [[Stitch]] and [[Skip]] and brought them to [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]].\u00a0He\u00a0was later tied up by [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], freeing Stitch and Skip.\n\nAt an unknown point in the original/current timeline, 086 was presumably activated, captured and named Clink.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nDespite not physically appearing, the first\u00a0624 experiments, presumably including Clink, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]] and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nIt is unknown whether or not Clink participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]].\n\nThe Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.\n\n==Trivia==\n*\"Clink\" is slang for \"prison\", which makes this experiment's name very befitting.\n*Clink was activated off-screen.\n*Clink is one of the rare experiments to have sclerae and pupils instead of solid black eyes, the others being [[Mr. Stenchy]], [[Mrs. Sickly]], [[Skip]], [[Nosox]], and [[Thresher]].\n*Clink, [[Huggo]], and [[Thresher]] are the only known experiments with stalked eyes, a trait common in the invertebrates that all three are inspired by.\n*Clink, [[Bugby]], and [[Plasmoid]] are the only known experiments that are hexapods. Interestingly, all three have characteristics similar to different arthropods.\n*Clink is the only experiment to [[Skip (episode)|debut]]\u00a0and appear in\u00a0an alternate timeline dimension created by another experiment. Interestingly, Clink and Skip's\u00a0numbers are very close to each other: 086 and 089.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nscreenCapture 17.07.13 16-40-39.jpg\nscreenCapture 17.07.13 16-41-12.jpg\nscreenCapture 17.07.13 16-43-43.jpg\nscreenCapture 11.10.13 12-56-26.jpg\nscreenCapture 17.07.13 16-45-37.jpg\nScreenCapture 17.07.13 16-46-12.jpg\nscreenCapture 17.07.13 16-47-09.jpg\nscreenCapture 17.07.13 16-48-31.jpg\nscreenCapture 11.10.13 15-12-11.jpg\nscreenCapture 11.10.13 15-19-01.jpg\nscreenCapture 11.10.13 15-20-33.jpg\nscreenCapture 17.07.13 16-50-54.jpg\nscreenCapture 17.07.13 16-54-12.jpg\nscreenCapture 17.07.13 16-55-11.jpg\nscreenCapture 11.10.13 15-25-04.jpg\nscreenCapture 17.07.13 16-57-52.jpg\nStitch Now - Clink.jpg|Clink in ''[[Stitch!Now]]''\n</gallery>\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Crustaceans]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Police officers]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
