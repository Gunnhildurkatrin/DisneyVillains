These creatures have long bodies of snakes (huge long ones) and the head of a cat and it shows the snake body has scales and so does the cat head, but the cat has whiskers and it has a forked tongue. This was seen in the episode \"[[Downhill]]\". [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim Possible]] was in [[Amy Hall|DNAmy]]'s lair and a cat sees Kim, but Kim turns around and it shows the cat is a Snake-Cat. The Snake-Cat wraps Kim in his body to suffocate her, but Kim and the Snake-Cat both fell into the shelf of cuddle buddies and the Snake-Cat is knocked out or dead. The explosion probably killed the Snake-Cat with the [[Rabbit-Rhino]], Pig-Man, and Chicken-Man, but the plush of cuddle buddies have made it, but they fell in the snow.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nScreen_Shot_2014-04-13_at_10.25.21.png\nScreen_Shot_2014-04-13_at_10.25.30.png\nScreen_Shot_2014-04-13_at_10.25.48.png\nScreen_Shot_2014-04-13_at_10.26.09.png|The Snake-Cat with Kim in its coils.\nScreen_Shot_2014-04-13_at_10.26.23.png|Falling down the stairs.\nScreen_Shot_2014-04-13_at_10.26.47.png|Falling down the stairs.\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Kim Possible}}\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Hybrids]]\n[[Category:Kim Possible characters]]\n[[Category:Mutants]]\n[[Category:Snakes]]\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
