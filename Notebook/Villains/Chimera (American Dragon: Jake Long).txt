Only one appears in the entire series.

It has the body and head of a lion, the head of a goat, and the head of a cobra. It also has the tail of snake. Its entire body is a mix of red and purple colors.\n\n==Magical Powers==\nA Chimera in general is very powerful. It has superhuman strength and, although this only applies in the Dream Realm, can cause physical harm to humans. Whenever it appears into someone's dreams, it will cause horrifying nightmares that will make that person grumpy and/or sleepy the next morning.\n\nThe Chimera is incapable of speech and often acts from its instincts. It is extremely dangerous when on the loose as it will invade all the dreams it can in one night to cause as much havoc as possible.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\">\nChimera Captured.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{American Dragon: Jake Long}}\n[[Category:American Dragon: Jake Long characters]]\n[[Category:Mystical animals]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Greek Mythology]]\n[[Category:Multi-headed characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Hybrids]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
