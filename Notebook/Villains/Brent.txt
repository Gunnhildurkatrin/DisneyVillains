He is a student at [[Norrisville High]] and [[S. Ward Smith]]'s protege.\n\nIn the episode \"[[Sword Quest]]\", Brent had an argument with his master, after he only had him make corn holders (something he kept failing at), and stormed out. He later returned ready to apologize, on to catch some conversation out of context, and believed Mr. Smith had replaced him with [[Howard Weinerman|Howard]]. Overcome with anger and sorrow, he was [[Stank (magic)|stanked]] by [[The Sorcerer (Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja)|the Sorcerer]]. In this form, Brent's skill in the art of metal working had significantly increased, and he crafted for himself plates of armor. Once Brent had kidnapped Howard, Randy took him on in the metal shop. However, his armor proved stronger than Randy's weapons, and armed with his flaming sword he thought back. Randy took his new sword and managed to smash his flaming sword, and then chopped his hammer, destanking him.\n\n== History ==\nHe is the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mr S.W Smith, the school metal shop teacher, and secret sword smith of the Ninja, he was over come with anger at his failings, and stormed out. He later calmed down and returned to apologize and beg for a second chance. However due to only hearing part of the conversation he assumed that he had been replaced by Howard. Overcome with misery and anger, he fell victim to the Sorcerer's magic and was transformed into a monster. In this form he crafted himself armour, and later attacked and kidnapped Howard, planning to inflict his revenge upon him.\n\nRandy caught up and fought him, however all his weapons simply bounced off Brent's armour. Brent revealed his own sword (as well as his power to breath fire) and attacked. At the last moment, S.W. Smith rushed in with Randy's new sword. With this sword Randy managed to destroy Brent's Hammer, which the magic was possessing, thus returning him to normal.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nSwordQuest_-_I_present_you_master.jpg\nBrent 9.png\nSwordQuest_-_090.jpg\nSwordQuest_-_093.jpg\nSwordQuest_-_094.jpg\nSwordQuest - 098.jpg\nBrent 8.png\nBrent 6.png\nBrent 7.png\nBrent 5.png\nSwordQuest - 125.jpg\nBrent_2.jpg\nSwordQuest - 154.jpg\nBrent 4.png\nBrent 3.png\nSwordQuest - 166.jpg\nBrent 1.png\nBrent 2 Sword Quest.png\nSwordQuest - 333.jpg\nSwordQuest - 339.jpg\nSwordQuest_-_376.jpg\nSwordQuest_-_377.jpg\nSwordQuest - 378.jpg\nSwordQuest_-_382.jpg\nSwordQuest - 384.jpg\nSwordQuest - 413.jpg\nSwordQuest - 414.jpg\nSwordQuest - 478.jpg\nSwordQuest - 497.jpg\nWarrior Brent.png|Stanked form\nSwordQuest - 520.jpg\nSwordQuest - 521.jpg\nSwordQuest_-_545.jpg\nSwordQuest - 622.jpg\nSwordQuest - 538.jpg\nSwordQuest - 542.jpg\nSwordQuest - 555.jpg\nSwordQuest - 678.jpg\nSwordQuest - 703.jpg\nSwordQuest - 716.jpg\nShloompthereitis - 026.jpg\nFlumeigation - 227.jpg\nBrent Full Body.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Randy Cunningham}}\n[[Category:Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Students]]"
