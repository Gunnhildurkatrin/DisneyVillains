He was the bass guitar player for the band known as [[Love Handel|Love H\u00e4ndel]], which was and still is a famous band in [[Danville]]. After the band broke up, he worked at a hair salon which soon became his own Bobbi's Hair Emporium. [[Linda Flynn-Fletcher|Linda Flynn]] goes there to keep her hair looking as it always does. Before he opened his hair salon. After being approached by Linda's sons [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]] and [[Ferb Fletcher|Ferb]], which included having him sing along with the song ''[[Fabulous]]'' to convince him he more than just part of the background, he reunited with [[Love Handel|Love H\u00e4ndel]] to perform a concert on [[Lawrence Fletcher]] and [[Linda Flynn-Fletcher]]'s anniversary. On the soundtrack, his name is written \"Bobby Fabulous\".\n\nThough he is very fashion-savvy and generally good natured, Bobbi can be extremely snobby, vain, and narcissistic, especially around people he considers \"Slovenly,\" most notably Love H\u00e4ndel drummer [[Sherman (Phineas and Ferb)|Sherman]], occasionally pointing out his faults.\n\n==Songs Bobbi has sung==\n*''[[Fabulous]]''\n*''[[You Snuck Your Way Right Into My Heart]]''\n*''[[Music Makes Us Better]] (possibly)''\n*''[[Just Passing Through (song)|Just Passing Through]]''\n*''[[Robot Riot]]''\n==Appearances==\n*\"[[Dude, We're Getting the Band Back Together]]\" (first appearance)\n*\"[[Thaddeus and Thor]]\"\n*\"[[Just Passing Through]]\"\n*\"[[Hip Hip Parade]]\"\n*\"[[Rollercoaster: The Musical!]]\" (cameo)\n*\"[[Make Play]]\" (cameo)\n*''[[Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension]]''\n*\"[[Tri-Stone Area]]\"\n*\"[[Delivery of Destiny]]\"\n*\"[[Fly On the Wall]]\" (cameo)\n*\"[[Cheers for Fears]]\"\n\n==Trivia==\n*Bobbi's hair (which is fake) is the same style as Linda's hair, only a different color. This is likely not a coincidence, because Linda gets her hair done at Bobbi's salon.\n**In fact, nearly everyone who goes to his salon has his hairstyle, including the employees who also share his hair color in addition to style.\n*When Bobbi tells Phineas to, \"Talk to the hand.\" Bobbi's hand makes a statement that is a call-back for [[Norm]], \"Secretly, I'm very lonely.\" (\"[[w:c:phineasandferb:User:Felinoel/Swampy Marsh Correspondence#.22|Secretly, I'm very lonely]]\")\n*Bobbi, along with [[Danny (Phineas and Ferb)|Danny]] and [[Swampy]], are named after producers of the show, [[Dan Povenmire]], Bobby Gaylor, and especially, [[Jeff \"Swampy\" Marsh]].\n*Bobbi may also be named after Alan \"Mr. Fabulous\" Rubin of the Blues Brothers.\n*'''[[wikipedia:Yes (band)|Yes]]:''' He may be modeled on bass player [[wikipedia:Chris Squire|Chris Squire]], who is famous for his stylish costumes in concert.\n*Bobbi is the one who seems to have changed the least since the 90's, the only differences being that when he is older, he has glasses and a soul patch.\n*His clothing when not onstage consists of a black turtleneck and white jeans.\n*Bobbi's voice for ''[[Just Passing Through (song)|Just Passing Through]]'' is radically different from his talking voice, sounding much more sung by [[Dan Povenmire]] (\"[[Just Passing Through]]\").\n*He is the only [[Love Handel|Love H\u00e4ndel]] member to have a Tri-Stone Area version in \"[[Tri-Stone Area]]\".\n\n==References==\n<references />\n{{PF-Wiki}}\n{{Phineas and Ferb}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fabulous, Bobbi}}\n[[Category:Phineas and Ferb characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Singers]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
