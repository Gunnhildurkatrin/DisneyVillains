Aladdin tries various ways to show the boy that he is just as tough as the [[Odiferous|Odiferans]], but keeps failing, which makes Bud think that he is weak. After stinker-breath lizards breathe on Uncouthma, [[General Gouda]], and some other Odiferans, Bud wants to smash the lizards, but Aladdin has another idea. He covers the cheese with peppermint to make the lizards eat them and make their breaths smell better. After doing so, Bud learns his lesson that smashing is not always the answer.\n\n===''[[Aladdin and the King of Thieves]]''===\nBud and his family make cameos in this film, when Aladdin and [[Jasmine]] finally get married. He is standing in a crowd where Aladdin and Jasmine are walking at a wedding procession path with [[Rajah]] holding Jasmine's dress.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink|Bud (Aladdin)}}\n{{Aladdin}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Bud}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Princes]]\n[[Category:Aladdin characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]"
