He wears a traditional Buddhist collar and usually ends his sentences with \"Namaste.\" He is the calmest of the Buddies and almost never loses his temper. The only time he did lose it was in ''[[Santa Buddies]]'' when [[Puppy Paws]], using his special magical collar, changed Buddha's symbolic statue into a snowman. His religion is Buddhism, regarding his name, and he always tries to teach his siblings the importance of yoga and meditation. He lives in Fernfield, [[Washington]], with his famous all-star father, [[Air Bud (dog)|Buddy]], and mother, [[Molly (Air Bud)|Molly]]. His owner is Sam, a young boy who is a yoga class student.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nBuddha 1600x1200.jpg\nSnow buddies buddha.jpg\nNormal Buddha s.jpg\nBuddha Card.jpg\nAir-buddies-disneyscreencaps.com-382.jpg\nSuper Buddies Buddha.jpeg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Air Bud}}\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Air Bud characters]]\n[[Category:Superheroes]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]"
