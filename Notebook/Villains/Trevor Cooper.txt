He is often taken to baby care seminars by his father, [[Ben Cooper|Ben]], while the other parents were mothers. There, he sat his first word, \"Fommy\", which means father and mother. When [[Alexander Cooper|Alexander]] accidentally drops the pacifier in the garbage disposal which Ben accidentally turns on, it causes him to cry for hours.\n\nThe next day, Trevor is taken to Ben's job interview about video game designing. There, he is seen eating a green highlighter and getting the ink all over his face. Later on, he feels awkward that [[Celia Rodriguez|Celia]] is riding in the wrecked family minivan to Nagamaki, only to be making noises through his fist.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cooper, Trevor}}\n[[Category:Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day characters]]\n[[Category:Infants]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Character stubs]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]"
