She is the leader of the Inklings, and helps the player along in the journey.\n\n==Background==\nChrona's father was an inventor, who is presumed to be deceased due to her wistful tone when mentioning him. At some point, she stumbled upon the land of the inklings and became their leader.\n\nThe inklings can create anything using imagination, one day she wished that she would have more adventure in her life, and an inkling interpreted that as to create a villain named Sez, that would threaten the worlds that Chrona would have to stop.\n\nShe enlists the players' help, to stop the evil creature threatening the different Disney worlds, and to restore balance using imagination and quick thinking.\nShe traverses all the various Disney worlds with a blimp, with a large magnifying glass, so she can see which worlds are in danger from [[Sez]].\n\n==Personality==\nChrona seems extremely headstrong, and independent. She's extremely helpful and willing to give out tips on how to navigate through the worlds. \nShe sometimes had little patience for the inklings mistakes, but always tries to remain calm and collected.\n\n==Physical appearance==\nChrona appears to be in her early 20's, she has emerald green eyes, and very long brown hair that's presented in a similar way to [[Jasmine]]'s.\n\nShe also wears steampunk-esque goggles and red suspenders, with a beige shirt. Her tool belt contains items like paint brushes and cogs, to help in the adventures.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nchronainklings.jpg\nchrona magnifiying.jpg\nDisney-hidden-worlds-6.png\nchroma back view.png\nchrona and inklings.PNG\nchrona and inklingstrailer.PNG\ndistressed chrona.PNG\nsad chrona.PNG\ninventor chrona.PNG\nDisney Hidden Worlds 7.jpg\nDisney Hidden Worlds 6.jpg\nDisney Hidden Worlds 5.jpg\nDisney Hidden Worlds 4.jpg\nDisney Hidden Worlds 3.png\nDisney Hidden Worlds 2.jpg\nDisney Hidden Worlds 1.jpg\nHiddenDisney screenshot 04.jpg\nHiddenDisney screenshot 03.jpg\nHiddenDisney screenshot 02.jpg\nyoung chrona.PNG|Young Chrona\nchrona dlrp.PNG\nPrincess Chrona.jpg\nDisney-Hidden-World-Inklings.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Concept Art===\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\">\nHidden Worlds Concept 13.jpg\nHidden Worlds Concept 12.jpg\nHidden Worlds Concept 11.jpg\nHidden Worlds Concept 10.jpg\nHidden Worlds Concept 9.jpg\nHidden Worlds Concept 8.jpg\nHidden Worlds Concept 2.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Hidden Worlds}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Inventors]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Orphans]]\n[[Category:Hidden Worlds characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in video games]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]"
