He constantly shoos off animals who would come near his hot dog cart.\u00a0\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Oliver & Company]]''===\nIn the movie, Louie is seen pushing his hot dog cart in [[New York City]]; trying to sell his hot dogs to hungry people. He smokes a cigar as he is waiting for a potential customer. A cat named [[Oliver]] smells Louie's sausages and goes up to the cart; hoping to get something to eat but Louie shoos him away instead. Oliver tries to go back and begs Louie to give him a hot dog by hanging onto his leg but this time, Louie kicks Oliver away into a pile of trash where a dog named [[Dodger]] has been watching the whole thing. Dodger offers to help Oliver get the hot dogs by pretending to scare the cat, thus causing Oliver to run and jump onto Louie frighteningly, as a distraction, while Dodger steals the sausages. As Oliver jumps off of Louie, he accidentally squirts mustard in Louie's face to which Louie throws the mustard back at him but misses. Louie doesn't appear throughout the rest of the film after this.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\noliver-disneyscreencaps.com-538.jpg|Louie's cart\nOliver-co-disneyscreencaps.com-559.jpg\noliver-disneyscreencaps.com-556.jpg|Louie pushing his cart\noliver-disneyscreencaps.com-590.jpg|\"Hey, it's a beautiful day, eh?
