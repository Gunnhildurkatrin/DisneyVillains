Like all Odiferans, he loves to bash and smash things. He's not very bright, but he has a good mind for battle, and he does love to battle. He has no love for [[Aladdin (character)|Aladdin]] and his company (they're too weak and they think!) or their methods of doing things, and doesn't hesitate to say so. He would gladly smash them, but knows that [[Prince Uncouthma]] is on friendly terms with them. He never really comes to like Aladdin, but sometimes finds he has to agree with the \"frail one\", and they part on not-hostile terms.\u00a0\n\n==Appearences\u00a0==\n===[[Smells Like Trouble]]===\nGouda first appears when Aladdin, his friends, Uncouthma, and his family are at a fair ground playing a \"ring the bell\" game. When Aladdin falls backwards when he picks up a heavy mallet, Gouda picks it up and hits the game hard with it. He is then seen eating cheese with the other barbarians. He later gets breathed on by a stinker-breath lizard and he passes out, making his face green with purple spots on it, just like the lizard did to some other people. Near the end of the episode, after the lizards eat peppermint-covered cheese, [[Genie]] makes one of the lizards breath on Gouda and he wakes up. Gouda does not believe that Aladdin defeated the lizard, but then he does after Bud told him so.\n\n===[[The Way We War]]===\nGouda and the other barbarians go to [[Agrabah]] and have a war. The reason he's having a war against Agrabah is that he thinks they stole their Most Sacred Crock of Cheese. At the end of the episode, he and the Odiferan soldiers find out that it was really [[Nefir Hasenuf|Nefir]] who stole their cheese, and demand that Nefir fixes Agrabah and refunds the money he was paid.\n\n==Trivia==\n*His name is actually a comical adaptation of a cheese known as a Gouda.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n{{Aladdin}}\n[[Category:Aladdin characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Military characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Soldiers]]\n[[Category:Generals]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]"
