He's a police officer and spends his days riding around Hazelnut in his police cart, assisting citizens in need.\n\nThough JoJo's job isn't exactly the most glamorous one in the world, he makes the most of it by having good friends and a good family. He occasionally stops off at a local restaurant and picks up something healthy (usually something soy-based or fat-free).\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Pepper Ann}}\n[[Category:Pepper Ann characters]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Police officers]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Uncles]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
