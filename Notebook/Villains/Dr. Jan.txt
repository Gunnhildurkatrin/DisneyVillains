She wears brown pants, white gloves, and a yellow shirt with dinosaur bones all over it.\n\n==Role in series==\nDuring [[Anne Boonchuy]] and the Plantar family\u2019s trip the museum Dr. Jan approached them when she saw they were interested in a mysterious vase, but a paranoid Anne warded her off. That night, she would encounter them again during their fight with the [[Cloak-Bot]]. She became obsessed with the talking frogs after seeing them without their disguises. Dr. Jan distracted the guards so they could escape. After hearing their story, Dr. Jan offers to help them in their quest; she also gives Anne some sound advice, by telling her that while she understands her desire to help her friends get back to their world, but she still needs to take a break once in a while and sends her home for some much needed rest. After doing some research on the vase, she discovers a hidden message and gives it to Anne the very next day at the Tai Temple, which reads \"Seek the Mother of Olms, she will guide you to your destiny\".\n\n==Trivia ==\n*She is very similar to [[Marcy Wu]] in terms of intelligence, interests, and enthusiasm.\n*Dr. Jan's voice actress, Anika Noni Rose, is also known as the voice of [[Tiana]] in ''[[The Princess and the Frog]]'', another Disney production about frogs.\n** Coincidentally, like ''Amphibia'', ''The Princess and the Frog'' also features [[King Andrias|an]] [[Dr. Facilier|antagonist]] voiced by [[Keith David]].\n*Like Mr. and Mrs. Boonchuy, she knows Anne and the Plantars\u2019s secret and becomes their ally.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\">\nFile:Fight at the Museum still 2.jpg\nFight at the Museum (11).jpg\nFight at the Museum (39).jpg\nFight at the Museum (40).jpg\nFight at the Museum (41).jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*[https://amphibia.fandom.com/wiki/Dr._Jan Dr. Jan] at [https://amphibia.fandom.com/wiki/Amphibia_Wiki Amphibia Wiki]\n{{Amphibia}}\n[[Category:Amphibia characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
