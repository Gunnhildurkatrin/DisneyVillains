He is an obnoxious and strange kid that [[Cricket Green]] somehow befriends.\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nGregly might be the most obnoxious person in Big City. He talks loudly and complains about everything. Even if something is not directed at him, he will still find some way to complain about it and has no consideration for the people around him. He does not entirely hate everything and will find something to like, but he will still be highly obnoxious about it. Despite all this, he does try to be social as he is seen hanging out with Cricket and the rest of his friends and he is shown to be somewhat self aware of the situations presented to him and will try to take part if needed to. Despite this, he will still find a way to insert his own abrasive commentary into the fold.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nGregly is a sickly lime green color with a small body and large head. He has bluish-black unkempt hair and wears thick round glasses. Above his large mouth he has what appears to be a vellus mustache. H wears a white shirt with a light brown jacket over it, brown pants and black sneakers.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nGregly pitch bible.jpg|Gregly as he appears in the pitch bible\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*Gregly was one of the original characters from the series pitch bible, but did not appear until season two because the Houghton Brothers had trouble trying to incorporate him into the show. Chris Houghton stated that he was based on a \"guy [he] used to know who edited porn, yelled a lot, and had pet snails.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://chrishoughton.tumblr.com/post/631003283193987072/i-knew-i-loved-the-one-off-character-gregly-but-i|title=Tumblr Gregly Post|website=Tumblr|date=October 3, 2020}}</ref>\n*Gregly might be older than the other kids as hinted by his vellus mustache.\n*Based on his yelling and the fact that he lacks social skills, implies that he might be autistic.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n\n*{{Interwiki|https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/countryclub9732/images/6/64/Favicon.ico|bigcitygreens|Gregly|Big City Greens Wiki}}\n\n{{Big City Greens}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Big City Greens characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
