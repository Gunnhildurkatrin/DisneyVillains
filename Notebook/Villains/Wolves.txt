Even when Maurice manages to get inside past the gate and close it, they still try to get him and one manages to bite his foot, but he still gets away safely. \n\nLater on, when [[Belle]] runs away from the castle after the [[Beast]] frightens her, she is ambushed by the wolves and attacked. During the chase, one of the wolves inadvertently fell into the thin ice of the lake and was stranded, slowing him down from the rest of the pack. The wolves almost kill her, but the Beast turns up, possibly tipped off by [[Lumiere]] and [[Cogsworth]] (who saw Belle leave and alarmed the Beast to save her from the wolves), and fights an entire pack of the wolves to save her. Although they manage to bite him several times, the Beast throws one (possibly the alpha male) against a tree and knocks him out cold, and the rest run off in fright, never to be seen again.\n\n===''[[Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas]]''===\nThe Eurasian wolves make a cameo in the midquel, taking place several weeks after their encounter with Belle and the Beast. When Belle, [[Chip Potts|Chip]] and [[Philippe]] go into the Black Forest to look for a Christmas tree, the wolves are seen watching them with angry glares and growls, but this time they don't attack them. This may possibly be due to the memory of their past experience with Belle and the Beast, and they know not to mess with them in order never to get hurt again.\n\n===[[Beauty and the Beast (2017 film)|''Beauty and the Beast'' (2017)]]===\nThe Eurasian wolves appear in the live-action remake, inhabiting the woods surrounding Beast's castle similar to what they did in the animated film. In this version, they have a more violent approach towards trespassers but seem to avoid the castle at all costs, as they quickly backed away from the castle gates the moment Maurice entered them. Notably, one of the wolves (distinguished by the scar across its left blind eye) appears to be the pack's leader.\n\nThe wolves first appear during the part where Maurice plans to get a rose for Belle. As Maurice travels with Philippe across the woods at night, Maurice notices a pack of wolves preparing to attack as Maurice finds himself lost at a snowy forest at night just as he rides on Philippe to escape from the pack of wolves just as he and Philippe arrive at the Beast's Castle. Later after the Beast angrily yells at Belle, she escapes from the castle and rides on Philippe in terror just as the wolves chase after Belle who then attempt to eat her and Philippe. The Beast manages to scare away the wolves, but is later injured in process while trying to save Belle. Afterwards, the Beast's wounds he received from the wolves are later healed the next day.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink|Wolves}}\n\n== Trivia==\n\n*The wolves were originally planned to make one more appearance nearing the climax, where Gaston, after surviving a fall off a cliff due to Belle throwing a rock at him just as he was about to shoot a downed Beast, stands up with a broken leg only for him to be surrounded by the wolves, with it being heavily implied that they finished him off shortly thereafter.  This idea was however scrapped from the final film due to the dark and gruesome nature of said scene.\n* To call them villains is rather unfair because these wolves, savage as they acted, were just predators looking for their next meal, which is harder during winter. Though it could also be possible that their aggression was amplified as part of the spell.\n*In real life, wolves are normally afraid of humans and tend to stay far away from them. Their behavior in ''[[Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas|The Enchanted Christmas]]'' was closer to their actual behavior.\n**However, [[France]], where ''Beauty and the Beast'' takes place, historically suffered from a large number of wolf attacks, with 5,400 people having been killed between 1580\u20131880.<ref name=\"moriceau2010\">[http://www.uc.pt/fluc/ihes/publicacoes/rph/indice_tomo41 Moriceau, J.

ISSN : 0870.4147]</ref>\n*The planned involvement of wolves fatally attacking [[Gaston]] was eventually reused as [[Scar]]'s death in ''[[The Lion King]]''. It features the [[Hyena Clan|Hyenas]] devouring Scar after he falls off a cliff during a royal battle with his [[Simba|nephew]].\n*They appear to have inspired a group of [[Wolves (Frozen)|wolves]] in ''[[Frozen]]'', as the latter group plays a similar role in attacking the main characters and being a form of the setting's antagonistic wildlife.\n*In the [[Beauty and the Beast (2017 film)|live-action remake]], most of their sounds are a mixture of those of Panthera cats such as leopards, tigers, and lions.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Beauty and the Beast}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Wolves}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Wolves]]\n[[Category:Beauty and the Beast characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Video game bosses]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:French characters]]"
