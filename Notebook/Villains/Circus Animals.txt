In the [[Dumbo (2019 film)|live-action remake]] are snakes, dogs, pigeons, crocodiles, and wolves.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===''[[Dumbo (1941 film)|Dumbo]]''===\nThe circus animals are first seen physically during the musical number \"[[Look Out for Mr. Stork]]\" where a flock of storks delivers baby newborn animals to their mothers, except for [[Mrs. Jumbo]] who did not receive a baby at night. As [[Casey Junior]] is being loaded to bring the [[Circus|WDP Circus]] to the next spot where the circus will perform at, the circus workers get the animals ready and just after that, the [[Ringmaster]] calls in Casey to get him ready for the next show to perform. Casey then travels very far and stops at the spot where the workers set up the circus tent to get the animals and performers ready for the circus. The following day, various circus animals are seen during the circus parade and later during during the part where the barkers are telling visitors to take a look at Dumbo. They are last seen during the musical number \"[[Baby Mine]]\" where several parent animals are sleeping with their offspring. No other circus animals aside from Dumbo, Timothy, and the circus elephants, appear throughout the remainder of the film.\n\n==Circus Animals==\n<tabber>\nElephants=\nElephants (especially [[Dumbo (character)|Dumbo]]) are quite the stars of the show.\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\">\nDumbo-disneyscreencaps.com-1328.jpg|The elephants when the train stops\nDumbo-disneyscreencaps.com-1793.jpg|The elephants during the circus parade\n</gallery>\n\n|-|Giraffe=\nA giraffe was seen sleeping at the beginning of the film. When a bundle of a baby giraffe flew in, it licked his newfound mother on her nose, waking her up. When the baby escaped from the bundle, he wobbled slightly on his legs, nuzzling his newfound. Two adults and the baby are seen again walking in their car when the circus is packing, with the adults sticking out. Then, one night, the train stops in town, waking them up. In the \"[[Baby Mine]]\": scene, the mother and her baby are sleeping soundly.\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\">\nDumbo-disneyscreencaps.com-248.jpg|The giraffe and her calf at the beginning\nDumbo-disneyscreencaps.com-390.jpg|The giraffes in their car\nDumbo-disneyscreencaps.com-1333.jpg|The giraffes waking up from the train stop\nDumbo-disneyscreencaps.com-4594.jpg|The giraffes sleeping\n</gallery>\n|-|Tigers=\nA tigress seen at the beginning of the film was sleeping while her mate is pacing restlessly around. Then a bundle dropped in and four tiger cubs scurried out toward the tigress' stomach, licking it as a fifth one jumped out onto her tail, waking her up. She nuzzles them as their father looks on with admiration. Three adults are seen in their own car during the circus packing scene. During the parade, the same three are seen enjoying an afternoon siesta.  During \"Baby Mine\", the tigress and three of her cubs are sleeping, one of them yawning and stretching before going back to sleep. The other two are either with their father or in another cage to sleep.\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery>\nDumbo-disneyscreencaps.com-227.jpg|The tigers and their cubs at the beginning of the movie\nDumbo-disneyscreencaps.com-364.jpg|A car of three tigers being nudged by an elephant\nDumbo-disneyscreencaps.com-1714.jpg|The tiger trio resting during the parade\nDumbo-disneyscreencaps.com-4611.jpg|The tigers sleeping\n</gallery>\n|-|Zebras=\nThree zebras and their foal seen during the circus packing scene are walking in a car with two camels. At the parade, four zebras drag a carriage containing a male lion.

She is sleeping as a bundle lands in her cage and opens to reveal a bear cub. As she hugs it, a second bundle lands in, and another one tumbles out, shaking its head. Happily, she grabs both cubs in her paws and licks one of them on the head. She and her cubs are seen in their car during the circus packing scene.\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery>\nDumbo-disneyscreencaps.com-166.jpg|The bear and her cubs at the beginning of the film\nDumbo-disneyscreencaps.com-344.jpg|The bear and her cubs in their car\n</gallery>\n\n|-|Lions=\nThree male lions are seen sleeping until a sudden stop from the train wakes them up. During the parade, a male one, possibly one of the trio, yawns as he rides in his wagon driven by four zebras.\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery>\nDumbo-disneyscreencaps.com-1331.jpg|The lions awakened by the train's stop\nDumbo-disneyscreencaps.com-1711.jpg|The lion during the parade\nDumbo 2019 Lion.png|A lion in the 2019 film.

It opens to reveal a baby who sleeps along with her, but she does not notice until the next morning when the circus is packing up. They jump in their water-filled car. At the parade, a hippo, possibly the mother, is yawning as it carries the calliope. During \"Baby Mine\", the mother and her baby are sleeping soundly in their pool.\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery>\nDumbo-disneyscreencaps.com-197.jpg|The hippo mother and her calf sleeping\nDumbo-disneyscreencaps.com-370.jpg|The hippo and her calf going in their car\nDumbo-disneyscreencaps.com-372.jpg|The hippos dives in the water\nDumbo-disneyscreencaps.com-1741.jpg|The hippo during the parade\nDumbo-disneyscreencaps.com-4639.jpg|The hippos sleeping\n</gallery>\n\n|-|Hyena= \nThe only scene hyenas can be found is the \"Baby Mine\" musical number, where a mother and her three cubs are sleeping and giggling.\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery>\nDumbo-disneyscreencaps.com-4631.jpg|The hyenas\n</gallery>\n\n|-|Kangaroo=\nA kangaroo is seen at the beginning of the film sleeping in her pen as a bundle comes in and a joey unwraps out of it. It jumps into her pouch waking her up. When she sees it, she reaches out her paws and hugs it. Two kangaroos and the joey are seen again in their car when the circus is packing. The mother and her joey are seen again during \"Baby Mine\" when she is using herself as a rocking chair.\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery>\nDumbo-disneyscreencaps.com-183.jpg|The kangaroo doe and her new joey\nDumbo-disneyscreencaps.com-350.jpg|The kangaroos during the packing scene\nDumbo-disneyscreencaps.com-4672.jpg|The kangaroos sleeping\n</gallery>\n\n|-|Monkey=\nThe only scene monkeys can be found is the \"Baby Mine\" one, where a mother on her trapeze swing holds three babies and a fourth one clings to her tail.\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery>\nDumbo-disneyscreencaps.com-4615.jpg|The monkeys\nDumbo 2019 Monkey.png|A monkey in the 2019 film\n</gallery>\n\n|-|Ostrich=\nThe only scene that has ostriches is the \"Baby Mine\" one, where one (presumably an ostrich mother) with two chicks sleeping with their heads in the ground.\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery>\nDumbo-disneyscreencaps.com-4651.jpg|The ostriches\n</gallery>\n\n|-|Camel=\nThere are three scenes in which camels are seen. The first is the packing in which a mother and her baby are in a car with three zebras and their foal. The second is during the [[Roustabouts (song)|Roustabouts song]], helping carrying the poles for the circus tent. The third is at the parade in which a caravan of camels are walking and chewing their spit. One of them looks at its mouth, then at the crowd, and swallows.\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery>\nDumbo-disneyscreencaps.com-355.jpg|The camels with the zebras\nDumbo-disneyscreencaps.com-1747.jpg|The camels at the parade\n</gallery>\n\n|-|Horse=\nThe only scene that has a horse is the parade scene in the next day, when the [[Ringmaster]] rides on it.\n\n=Gallery=\n<gallery>\nDumbo-disneyscreencaps com-1500.jpg\nDumbo2019 13.png|[[Holt Farrier]] riding on a horse in the 2019 reimagining of the classic film.\n</gallery>\n\n|-|Gorilla=\nThe only scene that has a gorilla is the parade in the next day, in which one roars and shakes the bars of his cage, accidentally loosening one of them in the process. But luckily, he manages to put it back.\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery>\nDumbo-disneyscreencaps.com-1722.jpg|The gorilla\n</gallery>\n</tabber>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Most of the animals have four fingers instead of five like their real-life counterparts.\n*The tiger trio are resting like humans in their car.\n*During \"[[Baby Mine]]\", the mother zebra's head is clearly drawn as a cel, but her body is drawn like the background.\n*There were thirteen storks (including [[Mr. Stork]], [[Dumbo (character)|Dumbo]]'s deliverer) seen flying to the circus at the very beginning of the film, hinting that there are indeed thirteen species featured there, with each stork delivering a baby for them.\n*The bear wagon changes color when the camera zooms toward it: in the wide view of the circus train, it is green, but up close it is red. The same is true with the circus worker's uniform when he is fastening it to the wagon.\n*The hippos in \"Baby Mine\" were clearly both drawn as backgrounds instead of cels.\n*The hyenas appear to be striped ones, which are real-life, yet lesser-known cousins to spotted ones.\n*During the song \"[[On the Open Road]]\" in ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'', the giraffes look similar to the ones from here.\n*The gorilla's roar has the same sound as the beetles in ''[[Mickey's Garden]]''.\n*The camels appear to be Bactrian ones, as they have two humps which in real life Bactrian ones have.\n*During the final scene of [[Dumbo (2019 film)|the 2019 film]], all the animals including [[Dumbo (character)|Dumbo]] and [[Mrs. Jumbo]] were sold to the wild in [[India]] because the circus is being re-established with a new rule about wild animals. The only ones that aren't done so are the monkey, a horse, the mice, and [[Timothy Q. Mouse]].\n*In real life, hyenas and hippos are not kept in circuses, because they cannot be trained.\n*The Ringling Brothers Barnum & Bailey Circus once had a gorilla named '''Gargantua''' but it was used only for exhibition in his cage as gorillas cannot be tamed.\n*A lion in the trailer is one of the circus animals that don't appear in the remake. Other animals that don't appear in the remake include tigers, zebras, giraffes, kangaroos, ostriches, camels, hippopotamuses, gorillas, and hyenas.\n**The animals that didn't appear in the original are snakes, dogs, pigeons, crocodiles, and wolves while the rabbit is mentioned.\n\n==External links==\nFor information of:\n\n*Bear: {{WikipediaLink|Bear}}\n*Kangaroo: {{WikipediaLink|Kangaroo}}\n*Hippopotamus: {{WikipediaLink|Hippopotamus}}\n*Tiger: {{WikipediaLink|Tiger}}\n*Giraffe: {{WikipediaLink|Giraffe}}\n*Zebra: {{WikipediaLink|Zebra}}\n*Horse: {{WikipediaLink|Horse}}\n*Camel: {{WikipediaLink|Camel}}\n*Elephant: {{WikipediaLink|Elephant}}\n*Lion: {{WikipediaLink|Lion}}\n*Gorilla: {{WikipediaLink|Gorilla}}\n*Monkey: {{WikipediaLink|Monkey}}\n*Hyena: {{WikipediaLink|Hyena}}\n*Ostrich: {{WikipediaLink|Ostrich}}\n\n{{Dumbo}}\n[[Category:Bears]]\n[[Category:Kangaroos]]\n[[Category:Hippopotamuses]]\n[[Category:Tigers]]\n[[Category:Zebras]]\n[[Category:Camels]]\n[[Category:Elephants]]\n[[Category:Lions]]\n[[Category:Gorillas]]\n[[Category:Monkeys]]\n[[Category:Hyenas]]\n[[Category:Ostrich]]\n[[Category:Dumbo characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Giraffes]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Horses]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Snakes]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Birds]]\n[[Category:Crocodiles]]\n[[Category:Wolves]]"
