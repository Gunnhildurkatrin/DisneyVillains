Others managed to appear or make it into the final film, but were either cut out or replaced later on during production and development.\n\nMany of those listed characters can be found in the storyboards for the unproduced scene of Marvin Acme's funeral.\n\n===The Walt Disney Company===\n\n*[[Chip and Dale]]\n*[[Practical Pig]]\n*The Prince of the Isle of Jazz from ''[[Music Land]]''\n*One of the [[Vultures (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs)|Vultures]] from ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''\n*[[Monstro]] from ''[[Pinocchio]]''\n*[[Ben Ali Gator]], [[Zeus (Fantasia)|Zeus]] and a [[Centaurettes|Centaurette]] from ''[[Fantasia]]''\n*[[Ichabod Crane]] from ''[[The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad]]''*\n\n===Warner Bros.===\n\n*{{WikipediaLink|Pep\u00e9 Le Pew}}\n*[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmanian_Devil_(Looney_Toons) Tasmanian Devil]*\n*{{WikipediaLink|Petunia Pig}}\n*{{WikipediaLink|Claude Cat}}\n*{{WikipediaLink|Hippety Hopper}}\n*The Gorilla Waiter from ''{{WikipediaLink|Lady, Play Your Mandolin!}}''\n\n===MGM Cartoons===\n\n*{{WikipediaLink|Tom and Jerry}}\n*[[Wikipedia:George and Junior|Junior]]\n*The Wolf from ''{{WikipediaLink|Red Hot Riding Hood}}''\n*The Police Inspector from ''{{WikipediaLink|Who Killed Who?}}''\n*The Turkey from ''{{WikipediaLink|Jerky Turkey}}''\n*The Country Rooster from ''{{WikipediaLink|The Hick Chick}}''\n*The Cat from ''{{WikipediaLink|The Cat That Hated People}}''*\n\n===Sony Pictures===\n\n*[[Wikipedia:The Fox and the Crow|Fauntleroy Fox and Crawford Crow]]\n*[[Wikipedia:The Dick Tracy Show|Dick Tracy]]*\n*{{WikipediaLink|Yakky Doodle}}*\n\n===Universal Studios===\n\n*{{WikipediaLink|Andy Panda}}\n*One of the Clouds from ''{{WikipediaLink|Pantry Panic}}''\n\n===Paramount Pictures===\n\n*{{WikipediaLink|Popeye}}, {{WikipediaLink|Bluto}} and {{WikipediaLink|Olive Oyl}}\n*[[Wikipedia:Superman (1940s cartoons)|Superman]] (1940's)\n*{{WikipediaLink|Casper the Friendly Ghost}}\n*{{WikipediaLink|Little Lulu}}\n*{{WikipediaLink|Baby Huey}}*\n*{{WikipediaLink|Herman and Katnip}}*\n\n===20th Century Fox===\n\n*{{WikipediaLink|Mighty Mouse}}\n*{{WikipediaLink|Heckle and Jeckle}}\n\n==Special Edition DVD Cameos ==\nNumerous characters that did not make cameos in the film made a few on the menus of the Special Edition DVD.\n\n'''Note''': Most can be seen in the second disc.\n\n*[[Lady Tremaine]] from ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''*\n* A [[Bread-and-Butterflies|Bread-and-Butterfly]] from ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''*\n*[[Elliott]] from ''[[Pete's Dragon]]''*\n*[[Kuzco|Emperor Kuzco]] from ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]''*\n\n(*) Denotes anachronisms; these characters (or, in the cases of characters such as Tinker Bell and Marvin the Martian, the animated versions of them that appear in the film) were created or adapted to cartoons after 1947. But as screenplay writer Peter S. Seaman said, \"The aim was entertainment, not animation history.\" It also has been argued that the characters may have \"existed\" in the Toon world before being \"discovered\" and featured in real productions.\n\n==Trivia==\n\n* There were some cameos that didn\u2019t appear as living characters in the film, but in photos and posters who were seen in it. Those characters were Huey, Dewey, and Louie, Lampwick from \"Pinocchio\", Willie the Giant, and Felix the Cat (who was also intended to appear in the film by his own).\n* The Dinosaurs from Fantasia appear in the film, but their shadows were only shown.\n*Some cartoon characters didn\u2019t have a cameo in the movie, but they were mentioned in it by other characters. Those characters are [[Alice]] from ''Alice in Wonderland'', [[Peter Pan (character)|Peter Pan]], [[Wikipedia:Screwy Squirrel|Screwy Squirrel]], [[Wikipedia:Chilly Willy|Chilly Willy]], [[Wikipedia:Dinky Doodle|Dinky Doodle]], and [[Wikipedia:Raggedy Ann|Raggedy Ann]].\n* Some cameos were planned for the unproduced sequel, with a lot of them appearing in the first film (such as Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, Pluto, the Seven Dwarfs, the Hyacinth Hippo, Dumbo, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Road Runner, Wile E. Coyote, Sylvester, Tweety Bird, Yosemite Sam, Foghorn Leghorn, Speedy Gonzales, Droopy Dog, and Woody Woodpecker) in addition to those that did not make the final cut (such as Chip and Dale, Pep\u00e9 Le Pew, the Tasmanian Devil, and Petunia Pig). Some new cameos were also included, such as [[Wikipedia:Hector the Bulldog|Hector the Bulldog]], [[Wikipedia:Rocky the Flying Squirrel|Rocket J. Squirrel]], [[Wikipedia:Bullwinkle J. Moose|Bullwinkle J. Moose]], [[Wikipedia:Huckleberry Hound|Huckleberry Hound]] and [[Wikipedia:Yogi Bear|Yogi Bear]].\n*There were also cartoon cameos in the Roger Rabbit shorts that were released some years after the movie. The characters appearing in the shorts are Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, [[The Mad Doctor (character)|The Mad Doctor]], the [[Three Little Wolves (characters)|Three Little Wolves]], [[Wikipedia:Raggedy Andy|Raggedy Andy]], and Droopy Dog in ''[[Tummy Trouble]]''; Clarabelle Cow, Pinocchio, and [[Ariel]] from ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' in ''[[Roller Coaster Rabbit]]''; and Tinker Bell, [[Evinrude]] from ''[[The Rescuers]]'', the [[Genie]] from ''[[Aladdin (film)|Aladdin]]'', and the Boy from ''[[Off His Rockers]]'' in ''[[Trail Mix-Up]]''.\n*Huey, Dewey, and Louie, Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck also appeared with the ''[[w:c:muppet:Muppet Babies|Muppet Babies]]'' versions of [[Kermit the Frog]], [[Miss Piggy]], and [[Gonzo]], and [[Winnie the Pooh]] and [[Tigger]] in the anti-drug TV special, ''[[Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue]]'' two years later in 1990.\n*The novel ''{{WikipediaLink|Who Censored Roger Rabbit?}}'' by Gary K. Wolf (novel on which the film is based) mentions original characters from American comic strips, including Dick Tracy (who was originally intended to appear in the film), {{WikipediaLink|Snoopy}}, [[Wikipedia:Blondie (comic strip)|Blondie]] and {{WikipediaLink|Dagwood Bumstead}}, {{WikipediaLink|Beetle Bailey}}, and {{WikipediaLink|H\u00e4gar the Horrible}}.<ref>https://www.mouseplanet.com/8606/The_Roger_Rabbit_That_Never_Was</ref> Bugs Bunny also appears and other characters such as Petunia Pig are mentioned.\n*In the 5th issue of the [[Roger Rabbit (comic book)|comic series based on the film]], there was an appearance of a character named Percy Pig, which shares the same name of the [[Wikipedia:Percy Pig|candy mascot \"Percy Pig\"]]. However, the comic was published in 1990, while the candy product with the same name was created 2 years after, in 1992.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n\n*[http://jimhillmedia.com/editor_in_chief1/b/jim_hill/archive/2014/05/08/storyboards-reveal-what-marvin-acme-s-funeral-in-quot-who-framed-roger-rabbit-quot-would-have-looked-like.aspx Deleted Funeral Scene Storyboards]\n*[https://www.mouseplanet.com/8606/The_Roger_Rabbit_That_Never_Was%7C Original Novel Cameos]\n\n{{Who Framed Roger Rabbit}}\n[[es:Cameos de \u00bfQui\u00e9n enga\u00f1\u00f3 a Roger Rabbit?]]\n[[Category:Character lists]]\n[[Category:Who Framed Roger Rabbit characters| ]]\n[[Category:Non-Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Touchstone characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Lists]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Who Framed Roger Rabbit cameos]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Non-Disney]]\n[[Category:Animated characters in live-action films]]"
