She is an ally and a friend of Kion and the [[Lion Guard]]. She helped [[Kion]] fight [[Janja]] and his [[Janja's Clan|clan]] and the Guard against the [[Outsiders]].\n\nBeginning in Season 3, Jasiri becomes in charge of the [[Outlands]] after [[Scar]]'s defeat since the premiere episode, \"[[Battle for the Pride Lands]]\" when all the Outlanders are free from Scar's tyranny after the battle against Scar was successful.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nUnlike [[Janja's Clan|Janja's clan]] and [[Scar]], Jasiri is friendly and open to making friends with the [[Pridelanders]]. However, her tie to her species shines through in how often she laughs, Kion noting that the world is like a giant game to her. Bold, spunky, and snarky, Jasiri is a hyena through-and-through, but unlike Janja, she is a friend to the Pridelanders.\n\nA natural leader, Jasiri has charisma that can sway those around her and rally them to her cause. This extends even to her enemy Janja, whom she was willing to forgive. She even saved his life and invited him to join her clan, which ultimately redeemed him. While she has a sharp wit and tends to make fun of her enemies, she is not arrogant. She is willing to deal with the Pride Landers and enjoys playing with the pups of her clan, showing her humility and agreeable nature.\n\nJasiri differs from her kind by looking past differences and focusing on where different species have common ground and noting how what they have in common makes them the same in a way that not only advocates peace and harmony but also how some very different species can be friends despite their differences. According to her, unlike Janja and his clan, most hyenas, especially her, respect the [[Circle of Life]] and are actually disgusted by hyenas like Janja whose selfishness and gluttony give their species a bad reputation.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nJasiri is a fairly small and slim spotted hyena, though she displays strength when fighting Janja's clan. She has gray fur that bears a slight purplish tint. Her lower legs and paws are a very dark shade of purple, and her underbelly is a dull pinkish-orange. Her tail is short and bicolored; most of it is deep purple like her paws, but the fur on the very bottom is much paler, the same color as her underbelly. Her eyebrows and ears both match the color of her mane and paws, and her inner ears are dull pink. On each side, she has three round spots, slightly darker than her main coat color, lined up vertically from her shoulder to the joint of her foreleg. Two smaller spots fleck her face on either side, and she has darker stripes along her neck as well as a streak along her spine. Her muzzle is the same color as her spots. She has large, deep blue eyes, encircled by darker fur, and a dark purple mane that is striped with brighter purple. Her mane is long and thick, with a lock in the front leaning toward her nose.\n\n===Abilities===\n*'''Animal Strength:''' Jasiri is a very strong hyena; she is shown to have very strong kicks and can easily pin down opponents, though she did have trouble escaping Janja's strong grasp when he pinned her to the ground.\n*'''Skilled Combatant:''' Jasiri is a very capable fighter; she is very resourceful when fighting to kick up dust to block her opponent's vision.\n*'''Intelligence:''' Jasiri is very intelligent and witty. She easily tricked Kion into falling into a thorn bush and is generally very clever.\n\n==Role in the series==\n\n===Season 1===\nJasiri first appeared in \"[[Never Judge a Hyena by its Spots]]\". When Kion gets separated from the rest of the [[Lion Guard]], he ends up in the [[Outlands]]. As he desperately seeks Flat Ridge Rock, he is confronted by Jasiri, who teases him for not having noticed her sneak upon him. Kion bristles at this and claims to have known she was there the whole time, but Jasiri continues to poke fun at him.\n\nShe catches his attention when she calls him out for being the leader of the Lion Guard, and she points out that his [[Mark of the Guard|shoulder mark]] is a dead giveaway. Kion questions if she's a part of Janja's Clan, but Jasiri answers ambiguously, asking Kion why he's in the Outlands. Though defensive, Kion tells her that he's hoping to get back to the [[Pride Lands]], and Jasiri points out that he's going the wrong way and says she will show him the way. Kion follows Jasiri, but is distrustful of her.\n\nKion remains distrustful of Jasiri and gets himself caught in a thorn bush. Jasiri gets him out of the bush and then leads the way to Flat Ridge Rock. After a while, Jasiri reveals that hyena clans like Shenzi's or Janja's are the exception, not the rule, and most hyenas actually respect the Circle of Life. She voices how similar hyenas and lions are before she and Kion sing \"[[We're the Same (Sisi Ni Sawa)]]\". When they get to Janja's territory, they part ways. After Kion leaves, Jasiri is confronted by Janja and his clan. She is able to easily defeat [[Cheezi]] and [[Chungu]], before being pinned down by Janja. Kion comes back to help Jasiri and drives the Outlander hyenas off using the [[Roar of the Elders]]. The Lion Guard arrives and at first, thinks Jasiri is a threat, but Kion assures them that she is a friend. Jasiri parts on good terms with the Lion Guard who return to the Pride Lands.\n\nIn \"[[Lions of the Outlands]]\", Jasiri enters the Pride Lands in search of Kion after a pride of lions takes over her family's watering hole, refusing to share it. Kion goes with her, believing that the lions in the Outlands must be lost and don't know about nice hyenas, completely unaware of the history of the existence of the Outsiders. Jasiri expresses her gratitude that Kion agreed to help knowing how difficult it can be to trust her kind. Jasiri introduces Kion to her clan, which consists of two adults, her sister, [[Madoa]], and two babies [[Tunu and Wema]]. Madoa expresses her surprise that her sister was telling the truth about being friends with a lion and that he is willing to help them as she and Jasiri point out the babies need the water the most.\n\nJasiri is ambushed by [[Nuka]], only for Kion to save her. She is ready to fight by his side only to back down when Nuka and [[Kovu]] agree to take them to see their mother, [[Zira]], in hopes to get her watering hole back. A short time later, she is shocked by Kion's ability to use the Roar to create rain. When Zira wants to talk to Kion alone, she warns him that she doesn't trust her and he should be careful. She is left with Zira's children including [[Vitani]] and is happy to take advantage of Nuka, who is told to \"play nice.\"\n\nWhen Zira lies to Jasiri about Kion claiming the watering hole for her pride, Jasiri runs off angrily. She encounters the Lion Guard who informs her about Zira's true motives and reassures Jasiri's beliefs that Kion would never turn his back on a friend. She joins the Guard in rescuing Kion and watches with delight as the Outsiders are thrown out of the Outlands by the Roar, reclaiming her family's watering hole. She compliments Kion on being the fiercest animal when the baby hyenas still cower away from him, causing everyone to laugh.\n\n===Season 2===\nJasiri later appears in the episode \"[[Rescue in the Outlands]]\" discovering Janja, Cheezi, and Chungu in her territory after Janja failed to mark it for the Dry Season. Janja angrily tries to take the territory back, but Jasiri defeats all three easily. Later, Janja receives orders from Scar to eliminate Jasiri. At the time, Jasiri is playing with Tunu, Wema, and Madoa. Jasiri finds Tunu and Wema, but they are attacked by Janja. Jasiri saves Tunu and Wema from Cheezi and Chungu, but Janja knocks all three of them into a steam vent. Jasiri is then saved by the Lion Guard, and Jasiri takes Tunu and Wema home.\n\nIn \"[[The Hyena Resistance]]\", Jasiri approaches the Lion Guard after watching them defeat the Outlanders and is informed of Scar's return. Kion offers Jasiri and her clan a place in the Pride Lands to stay, but Jasiri kindly rejects because the Outlands is her clan's home. She instead proposes the idea of forming the Hyena Resistance to oppose Scar to her clan. After the resistance is officially formed, Jasiri and her clan act as spies for the Lion Guard, informing them of the location that will become [[Army of Scar|Scar's army]]'s target while also thwarting each group in charge of the plan before they can leave the Outlands while the mission is carried out.\n\nHowever, after their third success, the skinks finds out about the Hyena Resistance and inform Scar who directs their next attack to Jasiri's clan by having Janja spreading a false plan that they will attack Mizimu Grove while in reality, the entire arm will ambush her clan. Hearing the false plan, Jasiri sends Madoa to inform the Lion Guard. However, once Madoa returned after delivering the news, they are surrounded by Janja's clan, [[Kiburi's Float]], and [[Reirei's Pack]]. Fortunately, the Lion Guard finds out about the ambush and helps the resistance in fending off the Outlanders. When Jasiri is ready to face Janja, one of the crocodiles is tackled by Fuli, hitting Janja and causes him to fall into the lava pit. Jasiri quickly saves Janja, much to the latter's shock. Jasiri tells Janja that they're the same and invites him to join the hyena resistance. Janja hesitates for a moment before refusing and leaves.\n\nBecause Scar now knows about the hyena resistance, Kion becomes worried that Jasiri and her clan won't be safe staying in the Outlands, but Jasiri still determines to defend their home and assures Kion that even if Scar knows about them, he can't do anything if they can't find them.\n\n===Season 3===\n\nIn \"[[Battle for the Pride Lands]]\", Jasiri works with the Lion Guard and Pride Landers to fight Scar's Army. [[Simba]] wants to take the battle into the Outlands. Jasiri offers her clan to help out with the battle in which Simba thanks her and the rest of the guard gathers the Pride Landers. Janja thinks that he and his clan might be on the wrong and thinks of \"[[A New Way to Go]]\". After being betrayed by Scar, Janja decides to get Jasiri for help. Janja tells her \"Sis ni sawa means 'We're the same'.\" Jasiri laughs and says that she's never heard him save that. Janja tells her that she was right and how Scar doesn't care about the hyenas; this was due to Scar's betrayal to Janja's plan while [[Pride Rock]] was set on fire. Jasiri and Janja rush into the Pride Lands where Janja tells the Pride Landers that he knows how to defeat Scar. Jasiri tells Kion to listen to what Janja has to say, to which he says that Kion needs to use his more powerful Roar. The next day, Jasiri's clan, Janja's clan, and the Pride Landers go and fight Scar's Army while the Lion Guard prepares to find a way to defeat Scar and end his tyranny once again.\n\nAfter Scar was defeated, Jasiri notices Kion and the scar on his face; this scar was obtained when [[Ushari]] struck Kion during a battle in an attempt. Jasiri soon becomes in charge of the Outlands, telling everyone to follow the Circle of Life. While [[Reirei]] seems to be ok with that knowing Jasiri will handle Janja, [[Kiburi]] seems hesitant and say they can take care of themselves but he does agree to back off and [[Mzingo]] says that the vultures will follow the Circle of Life, Kion thanks Janja and Jasiri for their help.\n\nIn \"[[Journey to the Pride Lands]]\", Jasiri and Janja arrive with [[Azaad]], leading them to the [[Tree of Life (The Lion Guard)|Tree of Life]]. Jasiri tells the Guard that Zira is back and has led the Outsiders to overthrow Simba to take over as the ruler of the Pride Lands; she also states that Kovu and Vitani have fully grown. Kion and the Guard decide to follow Jasiri and Janja back home. By using his roar, Kion comes up with all different shortcuts to get home faster. After a long journey, they finally reach the Great Stone Wall and later the Outlands just as Kion and his team prepare to ensure peace between Pridelanders and Outlanders.\n\nIn \"[[Return to the Pride Lands]]\", Jasiri and the others meet up with Madoa, Cheezi, and Chungu in the Outlands; Madoa says that they were hiding from Zira. They come across Mzingo and [[Mzingo's Parliament|his vultures]]. Jasiri asks Mzingo and the vultures for help. They soon come across Vitani and a group of lioness who call themselves the \"Lion Guard\" and starts attacking Kion's group. [[Kiara]] and Kovu soon stop the fight and Kiara asks Kion to come with them to Pride Rock so they can explain to which it is later explained that Zira has completed her Circle of Life journey and Kovu and Vitani have joined Simba's Pride. Kion thanks Jasiri and the Outlanders for their help. Later, Jasiri and her clan attend Kion and [[Rani (The Lion Guard)|Rani]]'s wedding (which doubles as Kion's coronation to become King of the Tree of Life).\n\n==Relationships==\n\n===Family===\n====[[Madoa]]====\n\nMadoa is Jasiri\u2019s older sister who loves her deeply and worries when she is in danger, as seen when Janja and his clan. She was surprised to see that her sister had truly befriended a lion but appears to trust her sister's judgment, despite having her own reservations.\n\n===Friends===\n====[[Kion]]====\n\n[[File:Jasiri_Kion_Fraternal_Link.jpg|right|250px]]\nWhen Jasiri first met Kion, her initial reactions towards the cub made it seem like she was his enemy. It wasn't until she helps Kion out of a thorn bush. Jasiri helps Kion get to Flat Ridge Rock. Jasiri and Kion also start to learn that [[We're the Same (Sisi Ni Sawa)]]. Kion even helps Jasiri fight Janja's clan. Kion saves Jasiri from Zira and her lioness. He also rescues her from Janja in the Outlands. Jasiri sets up a hyena resistance to help fight Scar's Army.\n\n====[[Bunga]], [[Fuli]], [[Beshte]] And [[Ono]]====\n\nJasiri becomes friends with all of the members of the Lion Guard. She even helps them fight Scar's Army.\n\n====[[Janja]]====\n[[File:Imagetlgnjahbisjasirijanja.jpeg|right|250px]]\n\nJanja and Jasiri used to be enemies. In \"[[Never Judge a Hyena by its Spots]]\" Janja and his clan tried to trap Jasiri until Kion came to help. In \"[[Rescue in the Outlands]]\", Scar orders Janja to get rid of Jasiri; however, the Lion Guard stops them. In \"[[The Hyena Resistance]]\", Janja is saved by Jasiri and says that he can join their side and not follow Scar's orders. Janja thinks differently and runs off. In \"[[Battle for the Pride Lands]]\", Janja thinks of [[A New Way to Go]] and wondering if he should join Jasiri. After Scar betrays the hyenas, he gets Jasiri for help. He even helps the Pride Landers and Jasiri's clan defeat Scar.\n\n====[[Tunu and Wema]]====\nJasiri has a caring and playful relationship with Wema and Tunu and protects them if they are threatened.\n\nShe clearly cares a lot for the cubs, as shown when she protects them from Janja's clan and shields them from the steam in the vent that they landed in.\n\n====[[Chungu]] and [[Cheezi]]====\nJasiri used to hate Chungu and Cheezi. However, when they join the good side, they became good friends.\n\n====[[Mzingo's Parliament]]====\n\nAfter Scar's defeat, Jasiri becomes good friends with Mzingo and the vultures after she becomes in charge of the Outlands.\n\n===Acquaintances===\n====[[Anga]]====\nAnga and Jasiri are on good terms. They worked together to defeat Scar's Army.\n\n====[[Simba]]====\nSimba and Jasiri are on good terms. Even though she's a hyena (since hyenas in the Pride Lands broke the Circle of Life since the event of ''[[The Lion King]]''), Simba allows her into the Pride Lands since she respects the Circle of Life as Jasiri told Kion that not all hyenas are bad. She helps the Pride Landers fight Scar's Army.\n\n====[[Makini]]====\n\nJasiri and Makini are on good terms.\n\n====[[Azaad]]====\nJasiri and Azaad are on good terms. Azaad helped Jasiri and Janja get to the Tree of Life quickly.\n\n===Enemies===\n====[[Scar]]====\nBeing a hyena, Jasiri has heard about the legend of Scar. When she hears about Scar's return she becomes an enemy of his by setting up a Hyena Resistance to help the Guard stop him.\n\n====[[Zira]]====\n[[File:Zira-Jasiri.png|thumb|248x248px]]\nAfter taking over her clan's watering hole, Zira refuses to share it with Jasiri or her clan, Jasiri does to not trust Zira even after she and Kion try to resolve the matter.When Jasiri is nearly hurt by Zira's eldest son, Nuka, Zira lies to her, stating that Kion has selected his kind over her to try and get her out, but eventually helps rescue Kion and defeat her pride.She hates hyenas greatly, which can be seen throughout the episode, ''Lions of the Outlands''.\n\nWhen she learns that Zira and her Outsiders have returned, she and Janja left the Outlands to find the Lion Guard, but after returning to the Outlands learning that she has completed her journey through the Circle of Life.\n\n====[[Nuka]]====\n[[File:Jasiri-Nuka3.png|thumb|250x250px]]\nAfter taking over her clan\u2019s watering hole, both view each other as rivals, with Nuka attacking her whenever he gets the chance, and finds her friendship with Kion questionable.\n\nHowever, Jasiri can defeat Nuka and his pride, when she comes to the aid of Kion with the help of the guard.\n\n====[[Kiburi's Float]]====\nJasiri hates Kiburi's float since they're on Scar's side. After Scar is defeated once again, Kiburi and his crocodile float become part of Jasiri's leadership.\n\n====[[Reirei's Pack]]====\nReirei's clan hate Jasiri and her whole clan. After Jasiri comes up with the Hyena Resistance and they kept on spoiling Scar's plans, they tried to help kill Jasiri's clan but failed.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}<br />\n==Trivia==\n*Jasiri is similar to Asante, a female hyena cub from ''The Lion King'' German audiobook ''Friends for Life'', whom befriends [[Simba]]'s son - Kion's noncanonical brother - [[Kopa]].\n*Jasiri translates to \"daring\" in Swahili.\n*Two hyenas - Scooter and Zawati - possibly served as inspiration for Jasiri. These hyenas were introduced to the writers of ''The Lion Guard'' by Jill Mellen, who made the suggestion of a friendly hyena to the writers of the show.\n*Excluding \"Asante\", Jasiri is the first hyena in ''The Lion King'' franchise to be on the side of good. This is due to the implied racism of the first film, as critics had assumed the hyenas as villains and the lions' prejudice against them promoted racism and discrimination.\n*She has many many giggle fits, fitting for a female laughing hyena.\n*Due to their interactions, it can be safely assumed that Jasiri and Janja have encountered each other before. This statement was proven true in the episode \"[[Rescue in the Outlands]]\".\n*The reason Jasiri was made a protagonist was due to the perceived racism the heroes held against the hyenas in the films.\n*Jasiri has shown to be able to overcome most of Janja's pack in a fight, with a little help from Kion and the rest of his Lion Guard, presumably based on female hyenas being stronger and fiercer than males, even as young cubs.\n*She speaks with a slight, but noticeable, Australian accent.\n*Jasiri and her clan are the only ones to consider the Outlands as their home, while all the other inhabitants describe this place as hostile and miserable.\n\n{{The Lion King}}\n\n[[es:Jasiri]]\n[[nl:Jasiri]]\n[[pl:Jasiri]]\n[[pt-br:Jasiri]]\n[[ru:\u0414\u0436\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0440\u0438]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Hyenas]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:African characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:The Lion Guard characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Queens]]"
