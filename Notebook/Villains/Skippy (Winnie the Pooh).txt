He is a sheepdog who only appeared in Season 4 of ''[[The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]''. Some believe he\u00a0first appeared in \"[[A Pooh Day Afternoon]]\", which marked his first appearance, but in \"[[Sorry, Wrong Slusher]]\", a sheepdog like Skippy appears nameless, so this might be the actual first appearance of him. He'll only obey Christopher Robin whenever he hears the sound of a horn, or when [[Tigger]] imitates the horn's sound by yelling, \"SQUANKY!\". His vocal effects are performed by [[Jim Cummings]].\n\n{{Winnie the Pooh}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Winnie the Pooh characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]"
