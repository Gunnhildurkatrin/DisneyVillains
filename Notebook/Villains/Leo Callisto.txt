He is [[Miles Callisto|Miles]] and [[Loretta Callisto|Loretta]]'s father, and [[Phoebe Callisto|Captain Callisto]]'s husband. He works as the engineer and pilot aboard the [[Stellosphere]].\n\n==Background==\n===Official Disney Bio===\n:''Miles' dad is an awesome inventor, pilot, and former pro-surfer. He's laid back and utterly cool, even when flying through space junk. A passionate engineer, he's never afraid to try something new in his workshop.''\n\nLeo Callisto is the best dad that Miles and Loretta could have. He's loving, kind, patient, and always sorts out Miles and Loretta's problems if they disagree about what activity they want to do. For example, Loretta wants to do exo-flexing and Miles wants to play quantum kick. What Leo does is turn the room off until they agree who will do their activity first.\n\nLeo used to be great at surfing on the waves at the Zuma Whirlpool. His son seems to have picked up his skills.\u00a0\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Leo is named after the Leo star constellation, which is also Latin for \"lion\".\n*Tom Kenny who provides Leo's voice is best known for voicing [[wikipedia:SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob SquarePants]] in [[wikipedia:SpongeBob SquarePants|the series of the same name]] and other characters, like [[Pat]] from ''[[Handy Manny]] '' and [[Rabbit]] in the [[Winnie the Pooh (film)|Winnie the Pooh]] film.\n*Leo's signature color is green.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Miles from Tomorrowland}}\n[[Category:Miles from Tomorrowland characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Mechanics]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Inventors]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Scouts]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Engineers]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
