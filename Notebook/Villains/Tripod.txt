He only appears in ''[[101 Dalmatians: The Series]]''. Presumably named for being the only puppy with three legs, Tripod is a very athletic, and hard-working puppy. He is seen to be a bit of a perfectionist, as in \"[[Full Metal Pullet]]\", and frequently contends with Lucky in several episodes.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[101 Dalmatians: The Series]]''===\nTripod is the only recurring dalmatian puppy in the series who has not been in any of the movies or the original book, and he also has the most speaking roles compared to the other minor pups. According to the episode, \"[[Dalmatian Vacation (episode)|Dalmatian Vacation Part One: Road Warriors]]\", he is not one of [[Pongo]] and [[Perdita]]'s original [[Dalmatian Puppies|fifteen puppies]], and was one of the adopted 84.\n\nDespite having three legs, he is very athletic, considerably more so than the other Dalmatians. He is [[Lieutenant Pug|Lt. Pug]]'s favorite member of the Bark Brigade and takes his brigade very seriously. According to \"[[Mall Pups]]\", he is the captain of the brigade. [[Lucky (101 Dalmatians)|Lucky]] sees him as his rival until the episode \"[[Lucky All Star]]\", after they help [[Roger Radcliffe|Roger]] pull his car out of the mud. After that, he is on better terms with Lucky and the other pups. Originally, he was quite stuck-up and cocky; however, after becoming more friendly with Lucky, this aspect of him starts to vanish. There has never been an explanation behind his missing leg, though it's suggested that he was either in an accident and it was amputated, or it was a birth defect.\n\n====Episodes where Tripod has speaking roles====\n*\"[[Two for the Show]]\"\n*\"[[An Officer and a Gentledog]]\"\n*\"[[The Great Cat Invasion]]\"\n*\"[[Lucky All Star]]\"\n*\"[[Our Own Digs]]\"\n*\"[[Citizen Canine]]\"\n*\"[[Full Metal Pullet]]\"\n*\"[[Cadet of the Month]]\"\n*\"[[Mall Pups]]\"\n*\"[[Walk a Mile in My Tracks]]\"\n\n==Trivia==\n*At the beginning of the episode \"[[Shipwrecked]]\", a puppy is shown hanging out with [[Dipstick]] that looks similar to Tripod, but with four legs and no sweatband.\n*At the start of \"[[You Say It's Your Birthday]]\", when [[Roger Radcliffe|Roger]] looks at the swarm of pups between himself and the bus, Tripod can be seen amongst them in the distance; however, with four legs instead of three.\n*Out of all of the \"background\" [[Dalmatian puppies]] in the series, Tripod has had the most speaking lines.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nTripod.jpg\nOpyzw1.png\nTripodCool.jpg\nLucky Tri-Pod LCTRSPHDL.jpg|Tripod with [[Lucky (101 Dalmatians)|Lucky]]\nTripodFullBody.jpg\nPuppyMovieNight.jpg|Tripod with Lucky, [[Two-Tone]], [[Rolly]] and [[Spot Chicken|Spot]]\nLucky Cadpig TriPod Pups Television Shock .jpg\nEVERYBODEHEVERYBODEH-1.png\nLucky racing Tri-Pod.jpg|Tripod racing Lucky\nImage109.jpg|Tripod with [[Lieutenant Pug]]\nLucky Cadpig Rolly Spot Wizzer Dipstick TriPod LTPug TTTGBIDL.jpg|Tripod with Lt.
