He is one of the Little Einsteins and their main transportation.\n\n==Background==\nIt is unknown how old he is because his age was never mentioned. Since Rocket used to be part of Leo's baby mobile that really sings, he is technically a toy. Yet somehow he advantaged to \"grow big\" like regular people, though he grew as big as the minimum size of a usual rocket. How he did so is unknown. Despite Rocket's origins, he even had a mobile of his own, which included the planets turning around the sun and played \"F\u00fcr Elise\". The first mobile is only found in \"[[How We Became the Little Einsteins: The True Story]]\" while the second mobile is only found in \"[[A Galactic Goodnight]]\".\n\n===Appearance===\nRocket is a gigantic 4-dimensional toy spaceship made out of red metal. He has a red antenna, clear blue windows, and yellow headlights for eyes. He has large jet engines on the back of him with fin-like tails on them.\n\nThe inside consists of a cockpit with 4 bluish-silver seats in which the Little Einsteins sit on. There is a gray and red steering wheel that resembles the handle of a slingshot. He has a dashboard all over the front of the inside covered in buttons and switches with different colors. When the Little Einsteins are inside him and the camera is on the outside, you can see them through the glass in his windows.\n\nThere is gray metal on the bottom in which red wheels sprout out from it. Rocket appears to have a pointy piece of metal on the top resembling a fish's top fin.\n\nHe can't talk, so he usually communicates by making the sound of a marimba and shaking his antenna. Rocket's grandmother looks just like him but she is pinkish-purple in color and Rocket is red, she is also bigger than Rocket. When he screams, he sounds like a musician insanely playing the marimba really fast. He also sounds like someone making noises with the marimba's keys when he gets the \"Rocket Hiccups\"\n\n===Personality===\nHe is nice and friendly, he is trustworthy, loyal and a great friend, and caring for his friends, including his grandmother when he made \"Rocket Soup\" for her.\n\n===Friends===\nHis friends are [[Leonardo (Little Einsteins)|Leo]], [[Quincy (Little Einsteins)|Quincy]], [[Annie (Little Einsteins)|Annie]], and [[June (Little Einsteins)|June]]. He also has other friends, but they (like him) are not human, including a young humpback whale.\n\n==Appearances==\n===Little Einsteins===\nLittle Einsteins is the only franchise he has ever been shown. He appeared in every episode of the Little Einsteins.\n\n==Rocket's Powers==\n*Rocket has backup boosters.\n*He can transform into any kind of vehicle like a pirate ship.\n*To get him to fly, you need to pat to the music.\n*Rocket has a drum thumper.\n*Rocket has astronaut suits for each of the Little Einsteins.\n*Rocket has a special place for conducting on his head.\n*His second most used tool is his Grab Nabber.\n*He has a Pogo Bouncer which helps him bounce over mountains and from planet to planet when counting them.\n*Anything you need, he has it.\n*He has many different sets of buttons that pop out of his dashboard.\n*On his dashboard, he has a light that blinks when he speaks.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"190\" position=\"center\">\nRocket introduces audience.png\nLittle Einsteins Rocket room.JPG\nLet's Rocket!.jpg\nJune kisses Rocket.JPG\nRocket Backup Booster.JPG\nRocket Look-and-Listen Scope.jpg\nSubmarine Rocket LE.jpg\nRocket Pogo Bouncer.jpg\nRocket Elephant form.jpg\nRocket chimp legs.jpg\nRocket Giraffe.jpg\nRocket underwater turbine booster.jpg\nRocket pirate ship.jpg\nCaterpillar Rocket.jpg\nFirefly Rocket.jpg\nFire Truck Rocket.jpg\nRocket and his grandmother.jpg\nWhatsApp Image 2018-10-18 at 16.59.59-3.jpeg|Rocket without his turbines\nWhatsApp Image 2018-10-18 at 16.59.59-6.jpeg\nScreenshot 2019-12-27 at 9.44.16 AM.png\nLittle Einsteins in space.png\nLittle Einsteins Promotional Poster.jpg\nLittle Einsteins Gallery (21).jpg\nDisney+LittleEinsteins.png\nLittle Einsteins Toys (16).JPG\nLittle Einsteins Toys (8).jpg\nLittle Einsteins Toys (9).jpg\nLittle Einsteins Toys (10).jpg\nLittle Einsteins Toys (1).jpeg\nDisney Playhouse Live - Little Einsteins (2).jpg\nDisney Playhouse Live - Little Einsteins (3).jpg\nRocketCrown.png\nDdw6glo-31a5f6d3-5276-46f9-89f4-38662e2b6513.png\n</gallery>\n\n==Disney Parks==\nHe made an appearance at Walt [[Walt Disney World|Disney World]] as a background for the Little Einsteins puppets in ''Disney Junior - Live on Stage!'' in [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] and the Magic Kingdom located at Animation Courtyard.
