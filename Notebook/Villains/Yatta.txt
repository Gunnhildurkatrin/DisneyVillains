She was first seen in\u00a0The Emperor's New Tuber. She's a country girl with a strong Tennessean accent (like her voice actress in real-life), and is very nice and kind to Mudka's Meat Hut customers. She is also a student at\u00a0Kuzco Academy. It's stated that Yatta's a vegetarian, so she probably only works at Mudka's for the money and not the food, since the place obviously sells mostly meat-type foods.\n\n==Episode Appearances==\n*\"[[The Emperor's New Tuber]]\"\n*\"[[Show Me the Monkey]]\"\n*\"[[Working Girl]]\"\n*\"[[Card Wars]]\"\n*\"[[Mudka's Secret Recipe]]\"\n*\"[[The Emperor's New School Musical]]\"\n*\"[[Vincent Van Guaka]]\"\n*\"[[Auction Action]]\"\n*\"[[Kuzcokazooza]]\"\n*\"[[Graduation Groove]]\"\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nBlog.png\nYatta1.png|Yatta's first appearance\nYatta_Kuzco_and_Malina.png|Yatta, Kuzco and Malina in episode \"Working Girl\"\nWorking Girl.jpg\nWorking Girl (1).jpg\nWorking Girl (2).jpg\nYatta Malina shopping.jpg\nYatta Malina.jpg\nPuffpiece.png\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n{{The Emperor's New Groove}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:The Emperor's New Groove characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Peruvian characters]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Hyenas]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
