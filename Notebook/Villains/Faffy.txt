Faffy is [[Dave Barbarian|Dave]]'s family's pig-shaped pet dragon.\n\n==Background==\nUnlike most dragons who spew fire, Faffy breathes lightning and is domesticated and has no tail.

It is mentioned in the show that Faffy has a one digit IQ.\n\n==Role in the series==\nIn the episode, \"[[Pet Threat]]\", Faffy is sad because the family forgot to get him anything during Dragon Appreciation Week, so Dave buys Faffy a diseased weasel for a pet.

When everyone is hooked on the video games, Faffy, [[Lula]], and [[Twinkle the Marvel Horse]] (being the only ones without thumbs) must face off against Ned.\n\nFaffy is once again the main focus in the episode, \"Slay What?\", [[Fang Barbarian|Fang]]'s barbarian idol arrives in town to slay an unsuspecting Faffy, so the barbarians must do whatever it takes to keep Faffy safe.\n\nIn the episode, \"Here There Be Dragons\", Faffy's allegiance to his dragon brethren makes it tougher for Dave to reverse an unnatural heat wave that has struck Udrogoth. But he eventually decides his family is more important and rescues them.\n\nIn the episode, \"Shake, Rattle, & Roll Over\", while retrieving the magical Combat Rattle from an ancient temple, Faffy causing a statue to come to life and attack Dave and the others.
