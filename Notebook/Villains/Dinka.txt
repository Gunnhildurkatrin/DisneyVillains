He is only 14 years old and wishes to have a beard as thick as his sister's and as great as his father's. He appeared in \"Sonny Get Your Goat\", in which he filled in for [[Tawni Hart|Tawni]] while she was in Glendovia. While Tawni was under the impression that she was in a comedy exchange program, Dinka, a dedicated cashier, thought he was in a cashier exchange. He is extremely proud of his job, and takes great offense when [[Grady Mitchell|Grady]] calls a cash register boring.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Interestingly, [[Nico Harris|Nico]] and Grady would have been the first \"Check It Out Guys\". In \"Sonny Get Your Goat\", Dinka would have been the third one not the first.\n*Dinka was originally from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n[[Category:Sonny with a Chance Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
