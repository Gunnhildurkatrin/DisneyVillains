(\"[[Ready for the Bettys]]\")\n\nThe band seems to be a parody of the pop rock band based an Australian band called The Veronicas (both of which are parodies of Archie comics characters, Betty and Veronica). It also seems to be based somewhat on the [[wikipedia:Spice Girls|Spice Girls]], an all-female British band.\n==Members==\n*'''Crash''': Leader, Singer & Guitar\n*'''Tink''': Bass Guitar\n*'''Missy''': Drums\n*'''Sir Bacon''': The Bettys' Mascot\n*'''Dennis''': The Bettys' Driver\n\n==Songs==\n* \"[[Ready for the Bettys]]\", co-written with Candace and Stacy.\n==Contests==\nThe Bettys participated in a radio contest where fans in the [[Danville]] area would get to spend a day with the band and ride on the tour bus to the concert. Candace and Stacy were the winners. The initial \"rewards\" for winning the contest were to perform chores for the band, such as shredding fan mail and cleaning the bus exterior while in motion. Candace and Stacy sang with the band at the concert that day, a more appropriate reward.\n==References==\n*\"Tink\" is also a nickname for [[Tinker Bell]], from ''[[Peter Pan (film)|Peter Pan]]'', another story Disney adapted into an animated movie.\n==Appearances==\n*\"[[Ready for the Bettys]]\"\n*\"[[Let's Take a Quiz]]\" (Pictured)\n*\"[[Phineas and Ferb Musical Cliptastic Countdown]]\"\n*\"[[Phineas and Ferb Christmas Vacation!]]\"\n\n{{PF-Wiki}}\n{{Phineas and Ferb}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bettys, The}}\n[[pl:Bettys]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Phineas and Ferb characters]]\n[[Category:Character trios]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pigs]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:English characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]"
