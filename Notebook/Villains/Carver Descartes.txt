He is an African American who has a strong interest in clothes and fashion (particularly shoes). Although he appreciates spending time with his friends, Carver desperately and hopelessly wants to be one of the cool kids and, ultimately, to become a celebrity. He is shown to be\u00a0a little\u00a0self-centered and annoying and can be immensely shallow and superficial towards women: he once rejected a girl just because she was too tall. Thus, the more touching moments of the show are when he is altruistic and battles his own insecurity. Carver often makes bad choices. One of the many notable jokes about Carver is that he secretly owns and tries on women's clothing, making him pretty strange. However, he usually (nervously) responds that the clothing is his sister's. Carver also has a younger brother named Todd, a toddler stuck in his terrible twos, who often torments Carver and often, by extension, his friends. He sometimes goes to his sister, Penny, for advice, but she frequently\u00a0ignores his questions. Carver's head is often compared to a pineapple for humorous effect. Carver is sometimes noted for his horrible handwriting, which often leads to people reading words much different from his intentions.\n\n==Clothes==\nAll of Carver's outfits consist of an open button-down shirt, t-shirt, pants, and sneakers, of various colors.\n*Standard Outfit - white t-shirt, yellow button-down shirt, gray pants, gray sneakers.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Many fans believe that Carver may have a shoe fetish, as he always loves shoes.\n*Carver shares the fashion sense, hairstyle, hair color, and traits of Brock of the ''Nintendo'' game and anime series ''Pok\u00e9mon''. They both have brown spiky hair, they have similar heads, similar outfits, and they love women.\n*Carver shares his middle and last name with the philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes.\n*His middle and last name may suggest that he is Creole.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nCarver.png\nCrush Test Dummies (2).jpg\nPenny McQuarrie (1).jpg\nPenny McQuarrie.jpg\nVengenace.jpg\nDixon.jpg\nVengenace (1).jpg\nVengenace (2).jpg\nLor1.png\nChar 1172.jpg\n024.PNG\nPizzaimpossible.jpg\nWeekenders cast skating.png\nCarver Tish billiard.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n<references />\n{{The Weekenders}}\n[[Category:The Weekenders Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Martial Artists]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]"
