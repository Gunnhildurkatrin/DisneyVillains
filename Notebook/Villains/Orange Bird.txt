Regardless, the Orange Bird used to live up north in the United States before deciding to migrate to [[Florida]] for its high quantity of citrus to eat.  It would come to live in the Sunshine Tree of [[Adventureland]].\n\nUnlike other birds, the Orange Bird is incapable of singing or speaking and instead communicates with orange-colored thought bubbles. He is mocked by other birds as a result of this and Orange Bird generally looks for friends wherever he goes.\n\n=== Development History ===\nThe Orange Bird was created in [[1970]] as a mascot for the Florida Citrus Commission in exchange for them sponsoring the Tiki Room attraction at Magic Kingdom. Accompanied by singer [[Anita Bryant]], the two appeared in ads for Florida oranges and Bryant narrated a record album telling the character's story. After the Anita Bryant ad campaign was dropped in the late 70s, the Orange Bird had a solo career and appeared in a few educational shorts in the [[1980]]s such as ''[[Foods and Fun: A Nutrition Adventure]]'' and ''The Orange Bird and the Nutrition Bandwagon''. Eventually, the bird would fade into obscurity when Disney and the FCC severed their ties in [[1987]].\n\nYears later, at [[Tokyo Disneyland]] in [[2004]], the Orange Bird would experience a revival as the Japanese became infatuated with the character and the character received a lot of merchandising to coincide with Japan's annual Orange Day on [[April 14]]th of that year. The Orange Bird soon returned to appearing regularly on merchandise in the US as well.\n\nEventually, on [[April 17]], [[2012]], the Orange Bird made a proper return to the [[Sunshine Tree Terrace]].\n\n==Appearances==\n\n=== Animated Shorts ===\n\n* ''Foods and Fun: A Nutrition Adventure''\n* ''The Orange Bird and the Nutrition Bandwagon''\n\n===Disney Parks===\n\n==== Meet 'n' Greet ====\n[[File:Bird2.jpg|thumb|250px|The Orange Bird at Walt Disney World.]]\nThe Orange Bird appeared at [[Magic Kingdom]] as a [[Disney Parks characters|walk-around character]] during that park's first decade.
