She lives on a farm with her father. She is an intelligent, pretty, yet short-tempered and sassy farm girl first introduced in \"[[Beetlemania]]\", where Yang lied about being a Woo Foo Warrior to impress her, but his plan backfired after he had to fight a giant steel beetle; however, Yin was able to get Yang to tell the truth.\n\nIn \"[[The Yin of Yang]]\", she shows slight feelings for Yang after he tried to act like Yin in order to impress her. In \"[[Smoke and Mirrors (Yin Yang Yo!)]]\" she actually tried to pursue him, though she was constantly interrupted by both Yin and Yang. As of \"[[Gone-A-Fowl]]\", she and Yang exchange their secret feelings for each other and Lina began pursuing a relationship.\n\nShe is now a part of Yin and Yang's Woo Foo Army as the second-in-command, though she is still marked as a Woo Foo Knight in a Little Less Training. Lina's species was unknown until the episode \"[[Yin Yang You!|Yin Yang You]]\", which reveals that she is a dog.\n\n\n==Trivia==\n*At the near end of the episode, [[Beetlemania]], Lina ditches Yang; but in [[Gone-A-Fowl]], it is revealed that she likes Yang a lot.\n*In [[A Bad Case of the Buglies]], according to Lina herself, she wears contact lenses.\n*Lina still sleeps with her baby blanket as mentioned in Dummy Up.\n*Some fans mistakenly misspell Lina's name as Lena, due to the pronunciation.\n*Like a dog, Lina has ears but doesn't have a nose or tail.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"185\">\nLina first appearance.png|Lina at the county fair.\nZombie slumber party.png|Lina as a zombie, along with Katie and Paige.\nLina watching TV show.png\nSass-quatch.png|Lina as \"Sass-quatch\".\nWonder Tweens.png\nLina in love.png\nYin Yang Yo! - S01E14 - The Yin of Yang Shopping Sprawl 666666.jpg\nYin and lina after yang was gone.png\nVlcsnap-2020-11-25-02h07m10s657.png\nLINAS2.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Yin Yang Yo!}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Non-Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Farmers]]\n[[Category:Yin Yang Yo! characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Zombies]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]"
