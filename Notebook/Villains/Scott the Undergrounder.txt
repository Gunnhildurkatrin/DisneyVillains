He was a pipe-fitter who was one of a group of people called the Undergrounders, who were stuck living in the underground caverns beneath [[Danville]], which they named Subterranis per his suggestion. Scott developed a quirky personality, frequently declaring anyone he encountered to \"be their leader\". Although [[Milo Murphy]] and his friends would help the Undergrounders return to the surface world, Scott chose to stay in Subterranis. He has since made various cameos in later episodes.\n\n== External Links ==\n* [https://milomurphyslaw.fandom.com/wiki/Scott Scott the Undergrounder] on [https://milomurphyslaw.fandom.com/wiki/Milo_Murphy%27s_Law_Wiki Milo Murphy's Law Wiki]\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Milo Murphy's Law}}\n[[Category:Milo Murphy's Law characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
