"[[File:SparkySnarky.jpg|thumb|250px]]\n'''Snarky \"Sparky\" Jennings''' is dog that was adopted by [[Sigourney Jennings]] and one of [[Stan Mordecai James|Stan]]'s friends in ''[[Dog With a Blog]]''.\n\n==Character History==\nSparky is a stray dog that was found by Stan in the streets of Christmas. Stan snuck him into the James-Jennings house and tried to hide him during Aunt Sigourney's visit. However, he gets loose and is discovered by Tyler and Chloe, who lose him again until Avery found out and had him wrapped in a Christmas box until her aunt leaves. However, Bennett mistakes the box for a Christmas present and places it under the tree. Sparky escapes again and was next seen jumping out of the Christmas turkey, exposing himself to the rest of the family. According to Stan, he was adopted by Sigourney and was renamed \"Snarky\".\n\n==Trivia==\n*Sparky being renamed Snarky possibly references Sigourney's personality against Ellen.\n*He's the third dog to have a known name. Followed by [[Evita Ortiz|Evita]] and [[Mandy (Dog With A Blog)|Mandy]].\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Dog With a Blog}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jennings, Sparky}}\n[[Category:Dog with a Blog characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
