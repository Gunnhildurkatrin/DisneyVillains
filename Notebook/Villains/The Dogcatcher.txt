At first, it looks like he captured Buster, however, he escapes and gets the best of him. Later, he catches [[Reggie]] after he's chasing [[Scamp]] and [[Angel (Lady and the Tramp)|Angel]]. Eventually, due to Buster's actions, he captures Scamp without a collar and takes him to the [[Dog Pound|pound]]. When he confronts Scamp and Tramp and is ready to capture them, Angel suddenly attacks him from behind. He panics as he tries to removes her but his net gets caught on the hook and he hits the wall hard. Becoming dizzy, he says that the fireworks are lovely and he passes out.\n\n===Comics===\nIn one of the Disney adventure comics, he also ends up getting arrested when, while trying to hunt down Scamp and Angel, he accidentally puts his net on a bunch of wigs at a wig shop and on its owner, which results in his arrest.\n\n===[[Lady and the Tramp (2019 film)|''Lady and the Tramp'' (2019)]]===\nNow named  '''Elliott''', he appears in the [[2019]] remake of ''Lady and the Tramp''. Unlike his animated counterpart, he takes his job as a dogcatcher very seriously and considers Tramp to be his arch-nemesis. Whenever he describes him to others in an effort to keep a lookout for him, he always mentions him as being vicious and having teeth like a shark, which always confuses them.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nTramp2-disneyscreencaps com-5265.jpg\nTramp2-disneyscreencaps com-3148.jpg\nTramp2-disneyscreencaps com-3113.jpg\nTramp2-disneyscreencaps com-6651.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Lady and the Tramp}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dogcatcher, The}}\n[[fr:Gardien de la fourri\u00e8re]]\n[[Category:Lady and the Tramp characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
