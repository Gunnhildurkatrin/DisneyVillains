She is a giantess who lives in the clouds. She likes to play the harp.\n\n==Role in the series==\nGoldie and Bear first meet Tess when a wind storm blows their balloon far into the clouds. She tells them it's hard to find others to play with when one is as tall as her. That gives Goldie the idea that Tess should meet Giant. When they arrive at his house, however, Giant is not present at the moment. When they slide down the beanstalk, Giant returns home with a bottle of milk. When he meets up with Tess, however, Giant gets all nervous.\n\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Goldie & Bear}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Goldie & Bear characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
