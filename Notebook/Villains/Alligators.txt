When their leader Ben tries to woo Hyacinth in which she attempts to run away from them, Ben Ali and his alligators pursue them also, frightening them away. The other dancers then hide behind pillars as the alligators search the palace, pulling out hippos, elephants, and ostriches, with the ballet becoming rapidly more chaotic. All the dancers begin dancing with the alligators, including Ben Ali with Hyacinth, performing lifts rapidly, finally standing over her, with her gazing adoringly at him.\n\n===''[[Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas]]''===\nBen Ali and his gator accomplices were part of [[Minnie Mouse]]'s skating routine. They are later seen in traditional artwork during the end credits. In this film, the gators do not appear to be wearing their red capes from ''Fantasia''.\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\nThe Alligators make several cameo appearances in ''[[House of Mouse]]''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps com-8741.jpg|The Alligators' first appearance\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps com-8759.jpg|3 Alligators are wearing red capes with triangle shaped hoods on them.\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps com-8767.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps com-9193.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps com-9191.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps com-9168.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps com-9104.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps com-9096.jpg|Ben Ali Gator's Alligators remove all their capes and join along with [[Ben Ali Gator]].\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps com-8794.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps com-9219.jpg\n3 gators looking.jpg|3 Alligators looking and smiling at [[Hyacinth Hippo]] while she's sleeping.\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps com-8842.jpg|The Alligators are frighten away by Ben Ali Gator.\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps com-9021.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps com-9160.jpg|3 Alligators dancing lifting 3 Hippos (These must be the same ones, 1 was whisping and the other 2 hear him when he's whisping.)\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps com-9142.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps com-9126.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps com-9120.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps com-9116.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps com-9031.jpg\n3 alligators frightening Hyacinth Hippo.JPG|3 of Ben Ali Gator's alligators are scaring and frightening Hyacinth Hippo.\n1 gator whisping.jpg|One of the Alligators is whispering [No Audio, Song continues]\n3 gators wearing red capes.jpg|3 of the Alligators are looking closely, smiling at Hyacinth Hippo.\nGatordudes.jpg|Alligators in the ''Fantasia'' Sega Genesis game\nHouseofmouseapplaud.jpg\nHouseofmouseapplaud2.jpg\nTumblr_nk36uskF5k1r3jmn6o1_1280.png\nTumblr_nk36xko0IT1r3jmn6o1_1280.png\nTumblr nklw1f8D9F1r3jmn6o1 1280.png\nTumblr nkmb39vczo1r3jmn6o1 1280.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Fantasia}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Alligators]]\n[[Category:Dancers]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Fantasia characters]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Wonderful World of Color]]"
