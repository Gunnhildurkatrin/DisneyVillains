He hates it when [[Lulu Plummer|Lulu]] crosses her eyes. [[Shane Wolfe]], at first, doesn't know how to change his diaper, so he washes his bottom in the toilet. For the starting times throughout the song \"Just Like You\", he reads a manual as he changes his diaper. Then he learns to do so without the manual.\n\n==Role in the film==\nTyler first appears when Helga comes in holding him while [[Julie Plummer|Julue]] introduces them to Shane. He spits milk on her, and Helga calls him an \"evil little puke machine\" in Romanian. Julie then holds him while she kisses his siblings goodbye. He cries as she hands him to Helga, and climbs into the car.\n\nTyler is seen again when Helga is holding him with his bottle in her hand. Peter throws Cheerios in her face, which upsets Tyler. The next morning, she feeds him until Shane shouts, \"EXCUSE ME!\" to get her attention. When the kids stand up, he wraps a black watch around Tyler's ankle.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Plummer, Tyler}}\n{{The Pacifier}}\n[[Category:Infants]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:The Pacifier characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]"
