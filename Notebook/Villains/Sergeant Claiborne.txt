Claiborne and the other two had been, allegedly, hunting \"a few animals here or there\" when the mighty tiger [[Shere Khan]]\u00a0found out about their sport-killing. Nathoo warns them to be aware of the tiger now that he suspects the entire tour party.\n\nLater that evening, as the group makes encampment, Claiborne is playing a game of solitaire, while the infuriated Shere Khan prepares to attack the camp, first by killing the young soldier who had hunted with them earlier. As he sets down the cards on the table, he hears an eerie growl in the distance and then notices that one of the cards has a menacing image of a pouncing tiger represented as a King of Spades.\u00a0\n\nClaiborne assumes that he was just imagining things when he heard the growl, but then hears another one. Jumping up in alarm, he then sees Shere Khan charging and pouncing on him. Claiborne barely has time to scream before the tiger goes for his neck.\n\nIn the ensuing chaos, Colonel Brydon informed [[Dr. Julius Plumford]]\u00a0of the tiger and that it attacked Claiborne. Plumford then went to attend to Claiborne, but the man was already dead.\n==Trivia==\n*Rick Glassey, who portrayed Sergeant Claiborne, was also one of the animal trainers employed during the film's making.\n*Ironically, the tiger-themed King of Spades card somewhat foreshadowed Claiborne's oncoming death.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nNathoobrave.jpg|Claiborne, a soldier, and [[Buldeo]] reprimanded by [[Nathoo]]\nclaibournetiger.jpg|Claiborne's tiger suspicions\nclaibourneridiculous.jpg|Claiborne finding it ridiculous\nclaibourneshock.jpg|Claiborne shocked at the sight of [[Shere Khan]]\nclaibourneattack.jpg|Shere Khan pouncing on Claiborne\nclaibournedeath.jpg|Claiborne's death\n</gallery>\n{{The Jungle Book}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Claiborne}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Jungle Book characters]]\n[[Category:Soldiers]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Military characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Sergeants]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in remakes]]"
