Gadget is an anthropomorphic mouse; she loves solving problems like an obsessed and quirky inventor. Her curiosity and fearlessness drive her to find solutions that others have simply overlooked, and her mechanical savvy makes her incredibly valuable to the team. There are a few people she doesn't like, but those few are typically villains. Gadget has a natural warmth about her that makes everyone welcome and pleased to see her. She's very loyal to her friends and frequently goes out of the way to help them.\n\nAt the same time, Gadget is constantly thinking. As exhibited in the episode \"[[Gadget Goes Hawaiian]]\", she has trouble focusing on just one way to do things. However once her focus has come, she can invent at a staggering pace\u2014for instance, her armored gyro-mobile in \"[[The Case of the Cola Cult]]\".\n\nGadget has her quirks. She thinks so much from an inventor's standpoint that it tends to make her na\u00efve at times. She has upset [[Chip and Dale]]'s romantic advances more than once, simply by not understanding what it was, they were after.\n\nWhen Gadget is excited about her inventions, she's known to use scientific jargon freely and talk at an extremely rapid pace. This tends to leave anyone listening to her clueless as to what she actually meant, but it never seems to bother her.\n\nGadget can be easily angered at times as well. As seen in \"[[Kiwi's Big Adventure]]\", \"[[The Case of the Cola Cult]]\", \"[[Dirty Rotten Diapers]]\", \"[[The S.S. Drainpipe]]\", and \"[[A Fly in the Ointment]]\", Gadget has a limit beyond which her friendly veneer is lost and she can become aggressive at times. Woe to the villain or anyone else who manages this feat, because once Gadget is riled up, she's a juggernaut\u2014thankfully, such incidents are rare. Regardless, she remains a strong female character.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nShe has a pink nose and light blue eyes, while the color of her hair has frequently been a topic of discussion as it changes from episode to episode. In many episodes, her hair appears to be orange in color, and in others, it shows up as being a strawberry-blonde. At one point, [[Tad Stones]], the producer of the show, was contacted by a fan and gave this explanation:\n:''\"I believe the intention was sandy-blonde. Because we work with a limited color palette, we pick the closest color to what we want. There was no intention of adding red. I did the first paintings of Gadget and she was completely blonde wearing blue coveralls.\"''\n\nShe usually wears a pair of lavender mechanic coveralls, a purple belt, and a pair of purple goggles which she keeps on her forehead when she doesn't need them. A white shirt can often be seen under her coveralls, but it is even more inconsistent than her hair, sometimes disappearing and reappearing within one scene. Though she can occasionally be seen in different outfits matching the situation, she never wears a dress or make-up unless it is part of a disguise.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]''===\nGadget was the daughter of Geegaw Hackwrench, a famous mouse inventor. It was implied at the time that her father had passed away. She first meets [[Chip and Dale]] courtesy of [[Monterey Jack]], a friend of her late father, as the group is in search of an airplane. Gadget helps the group solve the crime they are investigating by lending her inventive talents. Afterward, having nowhere else to go and no other obligations, she then became an official member of the [[Rescue Rangers]], making their base in a tree in the City Park and they promised to be her guardians and take care of her.\n\nFrom that point, Gadget usually assists the team via her numerous inventions. In addition to building and maintaining the [[Ranger Plane]], Gadget is the one responsible for the various technological items used by the team and is regularly inventing new vehicles and tools for the team's use. She has the uncanny ability to take discarded and unrelated items, and invent nearly anything with them. Unfortunately, her creations don't always work the way she intends and has sometimes failed at just the wrong moment to cause the team trouble. Both Chip and Dale are very attracted to Gadget and can be found often vying for her attention.\n\n===[[DuckTales (2017 series)|''DuckTales'' (2017)]]===\nGadget and the other Rescue Rangers appear in the Season 3 episode \"[[Double-O-Duck in You Only Crash Twice!]]\". Within the show's universe, the Rescue Rangers were lab animals granted intelligence by a device created by [[F.O.W.L.]] scientist [[Black Heron]], with Gadget's transformation being shown in demonstration footage to [[Steelbeak]], who subsequently asks whether she made the jumpsuit herself.\n\n==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==\nGadget started making appearances at the Disney Parks in [[1989]] in the Disney Stars Parade and [[1990]] through the [[Mickey's Toontown Fair]] at [[Walt Disney World]] and at The Disney Afternoon Avenue at [[Disneyland]]. In addition, she even got her own attraction at [[Mickey's Toontown (Disneyland)|Mickey's Toontown]] in [[1993]] - [[Gadget's Go Coaster]]. The coaster is still around, but Gadget herself rarely appears in the parks today.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*In 2010, a few news outlets reported about a religious cult in Russia that worships Gadget Hackwrench as an idol.<ref>http://www.odditycentral.com/news/russian-cult-worships-female-cartoon-character.html</ref><ref>https://www.themarysue.com/gadget-rescue-rangers-cult/</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Inducks character|Gadget}}\n*[http://users.cwnet.com/xephyr/rich/dzone/hoozoo/gadget.html Disney's HooZoo - Gadget Hackwrench]\n\n{{Rescue Rangers}}\n{{DisneyTsumTsum}}\n{{DuckTales}}\n{{Disney Heroes: Battle Mode}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hackwrench, Gadget}}\n[[Category:Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Mice]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Orphans]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]\n[[Category:Article of the week]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Mechanics]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Tritagonists]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:DuckTales characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Inventors]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Sorcerer's Arena Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Bonkers characters]]\n[[Category:Chip 'n Dale]]\n[[Category:Disney Heroes: Battle Mode characters]]"
