Unfortunately for Goofy, the rhinoceros is prepared to encounter him, thanks to a [[Titbird]] resting on his horn, and charges after him. Goofy tries his shot against the rhino, but the animal is too much for Goofy. He evidently leaves Africa, fleeing from the rhinoceros, so other hunters can shoot it.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\n39511.jpg\nTumblr nhs7m7WeZm1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\n39513.jpg\n39514.jpg\nTumblr nicacvM5GN1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Rhinoceroses]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:African characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
