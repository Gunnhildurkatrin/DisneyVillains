He most commonly interacts with [[Jackson Stewart|Jackson]], who is his employee, despite the fact that Rico is a few years younger. In the second season he also attends school with [[Miley Stewart|Miley]], [[Lilly Truscott|Lilly]], and [[Oliver Oken|Oliver]]. He generally acts as the main antagonist of the series and is the only major character not to know Miley's secret. However, since he has shown awareness that [[Robby Ray Stewart]] is the former country star Robby Ray, the publicly acknowledged father of [[Hannah Montana]], it could be inferred that he now does know. Rico is played by [[Mois\u00e9s Arias|Moises Arias]].\n\nRico comes from a very wealthy Latino family. His billionaire parents are often mentioned but never seen (though in one episode, the sound of his mother's voice can be heard on the phone, while in another his father appears in a photograph and is revealed to bear a striking resemblance to him). He has a sister, an almost identical brother named Mateo (Mateo Arias), a cousin named Teresa, and an identical Australian cousin nicknamed \"Angus\" whose real name is '''A'''lejandro '''N'''\u00fa\u00f1ez '''G'''onzalez '''U'''berto '''S'''i-Fu\u00e9ntes (Moises Arias). He also has a grandmother who tried to help Rico get the recipe for Jackson\u00b4s and Oliver\u00b4s cheese jerky.\n\nRico makes a brief cameo appearance in ''[[Hannah Montana: The Movie]]'' at Lilly's birthday party.\n\n==Personality==\nRico is manipulative, arrogant, and spoiled. Therefore he has no friends. His self-centeredness leads him to constantly look for ways to increase his revenue, even at the expense of taking it from others. (He sees everyone else as a direct competitor and becomes extremely jealous whenever someone makes money.) His catchphrases include his greeting \"Hey-Oh!\" and a diabolical laugh (\"Mwah-ha-ha!\"). He owns the North American rights to them.\n\nRico is very gifted academically. He skipped a couple of grades in school and is in the same grade as Miley, Lilly, and Oliver, even though he is several years younger. Studying is easy for him because he has a photographic memory. He is especially good at biology and mathematics, once finishing a biology mid-term exam in less than one second, with still enough time to recheck all of his answers.\n\nIt is revealed that Rico sometimes suffers from personal insecurities from his big ears and buck teeth. As a result of a [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]] complex, Rico uses his money, brains, or influence to put other people down or blackmail them into doing something they do not want to do. He also tends to pursue relationships with girls much older than himself in order to increase his social standing. He bribes both Miley and Lilly in this way.\n\nIn the episode \"Cheat It,\" Rico runs a sauna company called \"Se\u00f1or Steam\" which Robby patronizes.\n\nEpisodes that especially deal with Rico's character development include \"Me and Rico Down By the School Yard\" and \"Get Down, Study-udy-udy.\"\n\nRico and Jackson are almost always at odds with each other. Rico being Jackson's boss takes every opportunity to make his employee miserable. However underneath their surface hatred of each other, they are friends. Rico even admitted to Jackson once that he was the closest thing to a best friend that Rico had. In \"Wherever I Go\", Rico, because he cares about Jackson, fires him to force him to get a real job which Jackson fails in doing as he has no real skills. Rico, who almost calls Jackson his best friend but can't say it out loud (which Jackson reciprocates), gets Jackson a real job as a video game tester because he cares about him.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Suave, Rico}}\n\n[[es:Rico Suave]]\n\n{{Hannah Montana}}\n[[Category:Hannah Montana characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Anti-villains]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]"
