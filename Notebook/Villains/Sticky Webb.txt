In the first episode,<ref>Bring It On</ref> he warns Penny about [[The Gross Sisters]]' plan of getting rid of [[LaCienega Boulevardez]]. Throughout the whole series, he is being annoyed by [[Dijonay Jones]], who has a mega crush on him. He is Penny's male friend and Dijonay's love interest, although he dislikes her rather strong come-ons. Though he does have feelings for her, he only let those show once in one episode. He is very intelligent and knows a lot about computers. Sticky is still upset because his parents got a divorce.<ref>The Altos</ref> He is also short and has a funny way of showing that he has a crush on Dijonay. Sticky is very good at figuring things out, like puzzles and anything involving technology. As shown in ''[[The Proud Family Movie]]'', his cousin is rapper [[Fifteen Cent]], a parody of rapper [[Wikipedia:50 Cent|50 Cent]].<ref>''[[The Proud Family Movie]]''</ref>\n\n==Relationships==\n*[[Dijonay Jones]] (on-off girlfriend)\n\n==Episode Appearances==\n*''Suga Mama's Believers''\n*''Wedding Bell Blues''\n*''It Takes a Thief''\n*''Bring It On''\n*''Strike''\n*''Rumors'' (first appearance)\n*''Tiger Whisperer''\n*''Spelling Bee''\n*''She's Got Game''\n*''Forbidden Date''\n*''Don't Leave Home Without It''\n*''Seven Days of Kwanzaa''\n*''The Party''\n*''Love Thy Neighbor''\n*''I Had a Dream''\n*''I Love You Penny Proud''\n*''Puff's Magic Adventure''\n*''Enter the Bullies''\n*''Hip-Hop Helicopter''\n*''Romeo Must Wed''\n*''A Star Is Scorned''\n*''A Hero for Halloween''\n*''Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thingy, Baby''\n*''Poetic Justice''\n*''Hooray for Iesha''\n*''Camping Trip''\n*''Crouching Trudy, Hidden Penny''\n*''Boot Camp''\n*''One in a Million''\n*''Tween Town''\n*''Hmmm...
