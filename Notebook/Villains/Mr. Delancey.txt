He is voiced by [[Steve Carrell]].\n==Appearance==\nMr. Delancey is a caucasian man with blond hair, blue eyes, wears a light blue shirt, brown tie, lab coat, black belt with a pale blue buckle, jeans.\n\n== History ==\nIn\u00a0<ref>Field Trip of the Just</ref>,\u00a0[[Ingrid Third|Ingrid]]\u00a0sees him for some inquiries concerning\u00a0[[Eric Orben]]. She learns from Mr. Delancey that Eric is actually a straight A student, yet despite that, he'd been in detention 15 times, so Eric being an underachiever turns out to be just a front and he hides his reputation by faking that he doesn't do well academically. Ingrid finds it far-fetched, but Mr. Delancey explains to her that there are other things that don't always make a lot of sense and aren't what they seem. However, he doesn't believe that Eric was the one who poisoned\u00a0Guildenstern.</p>\n==References==\n<references/>\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Delancey, Mr.}}\n[[Category:Schoolteachers]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Fillmore characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
