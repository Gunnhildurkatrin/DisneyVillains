When the forest kingdom was under threat of a army from the human kingdom, Maleficent became the land's protector and summoned her army of tree creatures to fight King Henry's army and seemingly over-powered them but failed to protect Maleficent when [[King Stefan]] betrayed her and took her wings.\n\n===Border Guards===\nThe Border Guards are humanoid tree looking giants made of roots and greenery with faces that merely look like evil skulls and one of them named Balthazar. When in battle they are known to be strong and fearless and even the creatures of the Moors fear them. They carry tree like spears and masses and ride wild boar\u00a0looking creatures that are like them made of roots and greenery.\n\nThey also appear to serve as Maleficent's loyal guards as two of them stand beside her after she claims her throne making herself Queen of the Moors.\n\n=== Bush Juggernauts ===\nThese creatures are among the stronger members of the Forest Army. They resemble humanoid giants with downward-curving growths on the sides of their faces like horns. A large bush grows out from their backs, which is the only part shown above ground when they are hidden below. They are also incredibly strong and some even wield a hammer in battle. The Juggernauts were only seen during the battle against the old king and his army.\n\n===Forest Dragon===\nAt the moment there isn't much about the Forest Dragons Only that they appear to be giant snake like beasts in appearance made of roots and greenery with beak like snouts and sharp teeth. It is possible they live beneath the earth since they emerge from the ground when summoned by Maleficent to battle the invading human army led by King Henry.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nTree Creature Maleficent.png|Forest Dragon\nTree_Soldier_Headshot.png|Balthazar during the battle with [[King Henry]]\nMaleficent Screenshots 5.png\nMaleficent Battle.png\nMaleficent-(2014)-74.png|Bush Juggernaut\nMaleficent-(2014)-291.png\nMaleficent-(2014)-293.png\nMaleficent-(2014)-154.jpg|concept art of Balthazar\nMaleficent-(2014)-372.jpg|The Tree Warriors bow to their new queen\nforest-army-king-henry's-army.jpg\nTumblr nfw23kElc01qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Sleeping Beauty}}\n[[Category:Maleficent characters]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Armies]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Plants]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in remakes]]"
