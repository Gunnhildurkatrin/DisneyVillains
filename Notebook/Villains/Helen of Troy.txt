She is a popular girl at [[Prometheus Academy]] and the girlfriend of [[Adonis]], though she is very close friends to [[Hercules]] and generally a very kind person. \n\n==Personality==\nHelen of Troy is a very sweet if not generally vain character. She is a popular girl and is aware of her own popularity but does not hesitate to help others. She is very beautiful and sweet toward everyone, popular and unpopular (Cassandra, Icarus, and Hercules). While Helen's very beautiful, she doesn't appear to be that intelligent, though she's certainly much smarter than Adonis (as shown in \"Song of Circe\").\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nHelen-Hercules and The River Styxx01.gif\nHelen&Herc-Hercules and The Trojan War.gif\nHelen&Icarus-Hercules and The Trojan War.gif\nHelen&Herc-Hercules and The Trojan War02.gif\nHelen-Hercules and The Trojan War01.gif\nHelen-Hercules and The Trojan War02.gif\nHelen-Hercules and The Trojan War03.gif\nAdonis&Helen-Hercules and The Driving Test03.jpg\nAdonis&Helen-Hercules and The Driving Test02.jpg\nAdonis&Helen-Hercules and The Driving Test.jpg\nAdonis&Helen-Hercules and The Dreamdate.gif\nHadesfunnyhappy.png\nvlcsnap-2015-06-20-11h10m27s472.png\nHades&Helen-Hercules and The River Styxx.gif\nhelenpuffs.png\nHelen-Hercules and The River Styxx02.gif\nB2F81F4B-40B2-45A6-9FDD-DD6E2911A754.png\n86D15CB3-2E31-439F-B5AA-81819366C45F.png\n696943F8-2528-4809-B805-7CE6CA6804BA.png\n2EBBA932-B6A6-41A5-8AD5-C61E5AD8C23F.png\nYou're My Hero.jpg\nHercules and the Parent's Weekend (2).jpg\nHelen Mermaid.png|Helen as a mermaid.\n</gallery>\n\n\n==Trivia==\n* In the episode \"[[Hercules and the Son of Poseidon]]\", Helen dresses as a mermaid for the Homecoming parade, a nod to Jodi Benson's role as [[Ariel]]\u00a0in ''[[The Little Mermaid]]''.\n* Unlike her mythological counterpart, this version of Helen of Troy is not the mortal daughter of Zeus and half-sister of Hercules.\n* In the original Greek mythology, Helen was the wife of King\u00a0Menelaus\u00a0of\u00a0Sparta. Depending on the telling, she is either kidnapped or whisked away by Paris of Troy, which inevitably led to the Trojan War.\n\n{{Hercules}}\n[[Category:Hercules characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Greek Mythology]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Princesses]]"
