They enjoy playing and having fun, and sometimes have small contests with each other. The three love to play pranks and always get into trouble.\n\nUnlike the other two, Dimitri 1 has a force of habit of playing tug of war when a rope is nearby.\n\nThey love pulling pranks and getting in trouble. They go as far as to trying to physically assault the postman in '''\"[[London, We Have a Problem]]\"''' when he brings a package over to the front door'''.''' Like with most of the family they look down on cats, but they go the extra mile to harass and taunt; as they did with Constantin by throwing water at them as well as Deepak twice. In '''\"[[The Dog House]]\"''' Dimitri 1 is the only member of the trio not helping an unconscious Doctor Dave into the living room and instead is sitting on his butt eating the smashed pie, in spite of the fact that the they were all in danger of being taken away from their home. This indicates that he is the laziest of the three and likes taking advantage of the family. Also he seems to have a habit of pulling on ropes in a tug-of-war, something his brothers seem to lack. However, despite their trickster attitudes, the trio are willing to help the family get out of trouble, although they mostly do it for the thrill or chance of random destruction.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nAll three have white spotless fur on the front halves of their bodies and black fur with white spots on the back halves which resemble pants, a mark on their foreheads that resembles a cowlick of hair, and one ear notch. Their right ear is completely black and is always down. While they seem identical, the Dimitris have distinct traits to tell them apart. For starters, each of them has a gold chain collar with a gold number on it that designates which one is which from 1-3.\n\nDimitri 1 has a round patch spot on his left eye, a black left ear with one white spot and a small tatter on his right ear.\n\nDimitri 2 has a round patch spot on his right eye, a black left ear with 2 white spots and a small tatter.\n\nDimitri 3 has a round patch spot on both his eyes, a black left ear with 3 white spots and a small tatter on his right ear, but on a different place than Dimitri 1's ear.\n\n==Role in the series==\nThe Dimitris first appeared in a small cameo in the TV music video of the song \"[[In The House]]\".\n\nTheir first proper appearance in the TV series was in \"[[Winter Funderland]]\" where [[Dylan]] passed them on his way to the shower where the boys engaged in a burping contest. They later joined the indoor winter party, dancing with the other puppies and later flying in the air from a high jump over Dylan's head and crash landing into a pile of snow.\n\nIn \"[[Snow Day (101 Dalmatian Street)|Snow Day]]\", they're seen hanging on a ceiling lamp along with [[Diesel]] while Dylan is trying to get them to come down. Later, Dylan does a final head count with them being the first ones for Dylan to count and point at. At the end of the episode, they're also seen among the pups that went mudsledding with [[Doug (101 Dalmatian Street)|Doug]], [[Delilah (101 Dalmatian Street)|Delilah]], [[Dylan]] and [[Dolly (101 Dalmatian Street)|Dolly]].\n\nThey made a cameo in \"[[The Woof Factor]]\" as Dylan and Dolly were asking their siblings if anyone would help them be replacements for [[Triple-D]] as they got double-booked.\n\nIn \"[[The Nose Job]]\", they were among the audience for the tenth annual Nose Off and made fun of Spencer the Sausage Dog for mistaking a sausage for a piece of bacon. They later assist in breaking Diesel out of the slammer by disguising themselves as Diesel to distract [[Pearl (101 Dalmatian Street)|Pearl]], though Dimitri 1 himself briefly gets distracted by out of habit playing tug of war with the rope Dolly is wearing to lower herself into the station.\n\nIn \"[[A Date with Destiny...Dallas and D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu]]\", they pop Dylan's bubble wrap bubble, with him being unable to do so due to his underbite.\n\nIn \"[[The Wow of Miaow]]\", they mock Deepak for liking cats and make fun of the cats next door.\n\nIn \"[[Doggy Da Vinci]]\", they accidentally slipped over some spilled paint and stained Stanislav's white shirts for sale. However, with [[Da Vinci]]'s input, the artistic style of the shirts became popular.\n\nIn \"[[Fetch (101 Dalmatian Street)|Fetch]]\", the trio are first seen telling Fetch to belch, before using it to order the World's Largest Whoopee Cushion. They are later seen messing about with a Fetch of their own, which Dolly has ordered.\n\n==Trivia==\n*While the Dimitris stand out among the background puppies, and have played a significant role in numerous episodes, they're not considered part of the main puppies, nor do they appear in the opening titles of the show.\n\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nDimitri Model SheetsDL.png|Dimitri Trio Character Ref\nDimitri1.png|Dimitri 1\nDimitri2.png|Dimitri 2\nDimitri3.png|Dimitri 3\nThe Dimitrio (Dimitri 1, 2 and 3).png|The Dimi-trio laugh after a round of burping\nDimitrisDancing.png\nWinter Funderland Dimitris.jpg\nThe Dimitrio in the snow.png|Winter fun\nDimitris.png\nTheWoofFactorD1.jpg|I Love...\nTheWoofFactorD2.jpg|...To...\nTheWoofFactorD3.jpg|...But...\nDimitrisLaugh.png|Dimitri 1: \u201cThe Sausage Dog got the Sausage wrong.\u201d (Both Laugh)\nTheNoseJobGroup.jpg\nFlea-Mageddon Dimitris.jpg\nHairballDeepakDimitris.png\nDeepak With DimitriTrio LWHAPDL.png|Deepak and the Dimitri Trio hear the postman arrive.\nDimitrisWheel.jpg\nDimitrisTheBossIsBusy.jpg|Dimitri 1: \u201cThe Boss is Busy.
