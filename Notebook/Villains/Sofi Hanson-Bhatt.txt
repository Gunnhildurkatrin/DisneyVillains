[[Evan Morrow|Evan's]] friend, who is a talented hockey player, she leaves [[the Mighty Ducks]] to join the Don't Bothers, despite her perfectionist parents opposing the move.\n\n==Biography==\n===Team confusion===\nSofi initially plays for [[the Mighty Ducks]] during the time in which [[Evan Morrow|Evan]] also plays for the Ducks. When Evan is cut from the team, however, Sofi remains a member of the Ducks, despite multiple efforts by Evan to recruit her to the Don't Bothers. \n\nAfter the Don't Bothers build a team, Sofi becomes envious of the team spirit encompassed by the Don't Bothers. She remains reluctant to defect from the Ducks, however, given the superiority and prestige attached to their name; Sofi wants to go on to  study at Harvard and believes that the Ducks can help her with this. Things come to a head during the game between both teams. While Sofi scores a large amount of goals, she gets beaten by Evan scoring as time expired. [[Coach T]] become rude with the team after the game and came down on Sofi for letting Evan score. With that, Sofi accepts the Don't Bothers offer to join their team. \n\nSofi, however, remains a member of the Mighty Ducks whilst playing for the Don't Bothers, and is reluctant to tell her parents \u2014 or even ask \u2014 if she can swap teams. Sofi begins exhausting herself attending practices for both the Ducks and the Don't Bothers. Her efforts are thwarted, however, when her parents find out that she has been playing for the Don't Bothers.\n\nAfter a brief conversation with her parents, her father eventually realises that her position on the Ducks is making Sofi unhappy, and that she would be truly happy on the Don't Bothers. With this, he signs her permission slip and allows her to leave the Ducks for the Don't Bothers.\n\n==Trivia==\n*She's similar to [[Adam Banks]] because they are both characters who first joined one team and refuse to leave, but later left to join the current one when they changed their minds.\n*Sofi and [[Evan Morrow|Evan]] both have feelings for one another.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"185\">\nThe Mighty Ducks Game Changers - Poster.jpeg\nThe Mighty Ducks Game Changers - Sofi the Ringer.jpeg\n</gallery>\n{{The Mighty Ducks}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:The Mighty Ducks characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Students]]"
