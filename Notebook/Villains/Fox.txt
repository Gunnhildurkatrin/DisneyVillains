'Tis them red coats again!\"}}\nThe '''Fox''' is an animated character in the [[1964]] Disney film, ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]''. He has red fur and speaks with an Irish accent.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]''===\nThe Fox first appears during which [[Mary Poppins (character)|Mary Poppins]], [[Bert]], [[Jane Banks|Jane]], and [[Michael Banks|Michael]] have a magical journey inside one of Bert's sidewalk chalk drawings of the countryside. While they ride an enchanted carousel, the Fox is being chased by bloodhounds and their human hunters. Bert comes to his rescue just as the lead bloodhound almost catches him. Finding himself safe aboard Bert's horse, he becomes indignant with the pursuing bloodhounds, even kicking one that leaps at him.\n\nBert and the Fox escape the bloodhounds by leaping over a tall hedge, only to face an oncoming crowd of horse racers. After taking a dizzying spin from the passing racers, they stop to witness Mary win the race, after which everyone celebrates with candy apples and the song \"[[Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious]].\" Before they can continue further, a thunderstorm interrupts the celebration, forcing Mary, Bert, Jane, and Michael to return home. The fox is last seen fleeing to avoid the rain, and he isn't seen again for the rest of the film.\n\n===''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]''===\nThe Fox can be seen as one of the spectators in ''Bedknobs and Broomsticks'' during the soccer field sequence at [[the Isle of Naboombu]] where all the inhabitants are anthropomorphic animals.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nTumblr n57q3jruwS1rxt9glo5 1280.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*While the Fox himself does not appear in ''[[Mary Poppins Returns]]'', an animated dog named [[Shamus]] was later featured during the animated sequence in the Royal Doulton Bowl; coincidentally, both are animated anthropomorphic animals belonging to the same family of dogs that speak with an Irish accent.\n\n{{Mary Poppins}}\n[[Category:Foxes]]\n[[Category:Irish characters]]\n[[Category:Mary Poppins characters]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters in live-action films]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Bedknobs and Broomsticks characters]]"
