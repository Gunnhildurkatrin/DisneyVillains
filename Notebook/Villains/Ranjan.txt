He is also very hyperactive and occasionally slightly foolish. Although he tries to be as brave as his older brother [[Mowgli]] and constantly thinks he can survive in the jungle on his own and defeat [[Shere Khan]] when the big moment arrives he finds the situation too big for him to handle and tries to avoid it whatever way he can.\n\nRanjan looks up to [[Mowgli]] as an older brother (not just as an adopted brother). Ranjan is the \"little tyke\" of the cast because he is influenced by Mowgli's stories to be a wild, fun-loving child. But he can, in fact, be serious when he has to. For example, when [[Shanti]] was hypnotized by [[Kaa]], Ranjan promptly beats him with a stick, saving Shanti's life. Ranjan sees Shanti as a responsible sister, giving him a reason to allow her to hold his hand. Although when he sees a sign that Mowgli was near, Ranjan darts off without a care in the world. At the end of the film, he is seen playing with [[Bagheera]]'s tail before riding on top of him.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nRanjan somewhat looks like a younger and smaller version of Mowgli: with similar hair, body shape, more playfulness, desire to go to the jungle, and even wears a rubber loincloth exactly like Mowgli does (except Ranjan's is turquoise instead of red) and, like Mowgli, he is barefooted.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[The Jungle Book 2]]''===\nRanjan is the toddler son of [[Ranjan's Father|the village Chief]] and [[Messua]]. He appears at the beginning of the film watching Mowgli's puppet show about how his life was in the jungle, as his older brother Mowgli tells about Shere Khan, Ranjan jumps onto the projection screen trying to attack Khan, resulting in the screen falling apart and on top of him. Mowgli comes and secretly talks to Ranjan about their plan for tomorrow and shortly after, they both go to bed.\n\nThe next day, Ranjan wakes up Mowgli and they both sneak past their parents by saying they were going to do their chores.\n\nRanjan is later seen scaring [[Shanti]] by disguising himself as an animal and jumping out at her. The furious Shanti tells Ranjan that Mowgli is a bad influence on him and that the village was better than the jungle. Mowgli tells Ranjan about \"[[The Jungle Rhythm]]\" as Ranjan, Mowgli, and the rest of the village boys sing and dance their way to the jungle until Shanti tells them to stop and Mowgli gets punished.\n\nRanjan is partly seen watching the villagers battle Shere Khan and as he starts following Shanti into the jungle.\n\nRanjan later saves Shanti's life from [[Kaa]]. Shanti tries to tell Ranjan he needs to go back to the village, but Ranjan refuses and says they need to find Mowgli, Shanti then decides to let Ranjan help her.\n\nLater Shanti tries to see where they've been and where they haven't, Ranjan slides down a branch into some mangos and finds a peeled mango skin with a hole in the middle, revealing that Mowgli or something else had been there.\n\nAs Ranjan searches for Mowgli, he soon gets tired, so Shanti carries him on her back. Shortly after, he hears Shanti say that she heard Mowgli, which causes Ranjan to run off and fortunately find Mowgli. When Mowgli gets tangled in vines, Ranjan tries to help Shanti get him out but doesn't do very well.\n\nWhen [[Baloo]] tries to scare Shanti, Ranjan appears to be the only one scared, so Shanti takes Ranjan away, when Mowgli follows them, all three encounters and get chased by Shere Khan.\n\nAfter Shanti and Ranjan hide behind some bushes, Shanti tells Ranjan to stay there while she helps Mowgli. Ranjan tries to follow her but is caught by Baloo, who asks him where Mowgli is. Ranjan says \"Shere Khan!\" And Baloo puts Ranjan on his shoulders as they both chase after Mowgli.\n\nWhile running, they're both noticed by [[Bagheera]], as they tell him what's happening. Once they arrive at the temple, Ranjan is given to Bagheera as Baloo goes to help Mowgli.\n\nAfter Khan is defeated, Mowgli introduces Ranjan to his friends. After noticing other villagers in the distance, the kids return to the village.\n\nAfter getting past his parents and into the jungle, Ranjan is last seen trying to catch Bagheera's tail, before riding atop his back.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Ranjan getting his loincloth stuck on a branch is a reference to the first movie when Bagheera tries to drag Mowgli to the Man-Village with his jaws.\n*While Ranjan wasn't in both Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Book stories, there is an unnamed baby child of Messua that appeared in ''The Second Jungle Book''<nowiki/>'s story, \"The Spring Running.\" It's possible that Ranjan is the Disney adaption of that baby child.\n\n{{The Jungle Book}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Jungle Book characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Tritagonists]]\n[[Category:Toddlers]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Indian characters]]"
