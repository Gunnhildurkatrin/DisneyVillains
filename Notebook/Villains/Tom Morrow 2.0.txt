The character of Tom Morrow originated however from the original [[Rocket to the Moon]] attraction in Disneyland, originally having been portrayed as a human. He could've also been inspired by TOM, the robot host of competitor Cartoon Network's weekday afternoon action block Toonami.\n\nTom Morrow 2.0 was removed in the 2007-2008 renovation of Innovations. The robot later made an appearance at the Odyssey Building which also features [[Figment]] from the original [[Journey into Imagination]] ride, and one of the characters from [[Kitchen Kabaret]].\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n=== Innoventions ===\nTom Morrow 2.0 was the host of this attraction where he showed off technology.\n\n=== Rockettower Plaza ===\nTom Morrow 2.0 made a cameo appearance in  ''Stitch's Supersonic Celebration''.
