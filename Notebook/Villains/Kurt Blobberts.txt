Kurt attended Woxagon Elementary in the year X21 where he was in first grade. It was here where he met two of his future best friends, [[Eddie Horton|Eddie]] and [[Douglas McNoggin|Douglas]]. He would later become friends with Lloyd Nebulon, who made a fool of himself on his first day of school.\n\n===Personality===\nKurt is an optimistic but somewhat dim-witted alien who is apparently somewhat illiterate. He always tries to find the bright-side to every situation, no matter how bleak it seems. Unlike his friends, Kurt has no real interest in becoming popular and only cares about being happy with himself. Kurt also appalls violence and would prefer to make peace rather than fight. Despite this all though, he is treated and regarded by the more popular social circle almost nonetheless the same as the rest of his group of more savvy and intelligent friends. However when he and his best friend Douglas became Kurtlas, all the power went to their heads and they became the biggest bullies at Luna Vista Middle School until Lloyd talked some sense into them.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Relatives===\n*Mr. Blobberts (Father)\n*Mrs. Blobberts (Mother)\n*Tina Blobberts (Sister)\n*Edna Blobberts (Cousin)\n*Jeb Blobberts (Uncle)\n\n==Quotes==\n*\"Hooray! I'm not sad anymore.\"\n*\"But...they're so cute and cuddly.\"\n*\"I got a monocle with diamonds on it. And look at me! I look like a fancy rich guy!\"\n\n==Trivia==\n*Kurt shares the many traits, qualities, and voice actor of Patrick the Starfish of the ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' franchise.\n*Throughout the series, Kurt\u2019s body color is often stated as \u201c blue\u201d when he is perceivably the color purple.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nKurt.png\nAll four friends (Children).png\nThe Big Sleepover (4).jpg\nHeads Up Blobberts!.jpg\nHeads Up Blobberts!
