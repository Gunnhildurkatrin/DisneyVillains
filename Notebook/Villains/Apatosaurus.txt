When the [[Tyrannosaurus Rex|Tyrannosaurus]] lunged for the herbivores, Apatosaurus ran and watched its showdown with [[Stegosaurus]]. It is then seen marching with the other dinosaurs during the drought. They are then trapped in the muddy pit with other Stegosaurs, and they die of heat exhaustion and are attacked by desperately hungry [[Ceratosaurus|Ceratosaurs]].\n\n===''[[The Little Mermaid (TV series)|The Little Mermaid]]''===\nAn Apatosaurus also appears in ''The Little Mermaid'' episode \"[[Land of the Dinosaurs]]\" along with [[Stegosaurus]], [[Triceratops]], and [[Tyrannosaurus Rex]].\n\n===''[[The Legend of Tarzan]]''===\nAn Apatosaurus herd makes an appearance in the episode \"[[Tarzan and the Hidden World]]\".\n\n===''[[The Good Dinosaur]]''===\n[[Arlo]] and his family are Apatosaurus which are the central dinosaurs in the Pixar film.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nBrontosaurus_eating.jpg\nFantasia_-_2_brontosaurus.jpg\nFantasia_-_4_brontosaurus.jpg\nUn_branco_di_brontosauri.jpg\nImagesCAQCCTQS.png\nGroup_trap_in_the_mud_while_2_Ceratosaurus_attacking.jpg\nLandofthedinosaurs81.jpg|Ariel finds frozen dinosaurs\nLandofthedinosaurs92.jpg\nLandofthedinosaurs112.jpg|Ariel finds Flounder frozen\nLandofthedinosaurs126.jpg\nLandofthedinosaurs131.jpg\nLandofthedinosaurs164.jpg\nPelucidar.jpg|An Apatosaurus herd in [[Pellucidar]]\nRoSp204.jpg\nRoSp_12.jpg\nRoSp_13.jpg\nPrehistoric_jungle.jpg\nDino-swamp-concept.jpg\nRite_spring_concept.jpg\nTumblr_nhz8gylHbt1rqqcizo1_1280.jpg\n2854202810_b641b315d8.jpg\nBronto-model-sheet.png\nBronto-model-sheet_2.png\nTumblr_nloiezsyhb1sa3t1go3_1280.jpg\nDisney_FANTASIA_Animation_Model_Drawing_BRONTOSAURUS.jpg\nBronto-sketch-2.png\nBronto-sketch-1.png\nApatosaurus Feeding.jpg.png\nTarzan Dinosaur book.jpg.png\nAMNH_Apatosaurus.jpeg|A skeleton of Apatosaurus at the {{WikipediaLink|American Museum of Natural History}}, [[New York City|New York, NY]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Apatosaurus shares a lot of similarities with [[Diplodocus]]: they both are sauropods, both eat plants, both are diplodocoids, and both lived in the Jurassic Period of North America.\n*Brontosaurus and Apatosaurus were once thought to be one and the same. However, examinations of the two in 2015 show that Brontosaurus is, in fact, a separate animal from Apatosaurus, but at the same time is its closest relative in a family of diplodocids called the Apatosaurinae.\n*Apatosaurus was able to walk on two legs as a baby (based on footprints) and walked on all fours as it grew into an adult.\n*Apatosaurus and other diplodocids were able to move their tails fast enough to break the sound barrier; this is believed to have been a useful defense against predators.\n\n{{Fantasia}}\n[[Category:Dinosaurs]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Fantasia characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Tarzan characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:The Little Mermaid characters]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric animals]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric characters]]\n[[Category:The Good Dinosaur characters]]"
