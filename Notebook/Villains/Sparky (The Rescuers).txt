He is a fly who works with [[Jake (The Rescuers)|Jake]] at the Australia Airport. He is vocal effects by [[Frank Welker]].\n\n==Role in [[The Rescuers Down Under|the film]]==\nIn the movie, Sparky is a fly who works with [[Jake (The Rescuers)|Jake]] the kangaroo mouse at the Australia Airport. He is first seen playing checkers with Jake to which he wins and Jake calls him\u00a0a \"wise fly.\" Then they get a call over the radio from [[Wilbur (The Rescuers)|Wilbur]] the albatross requesting permission to land to which Jake tells Wilbur not to because the runway isn't big enough for a bird his size, but Wilbur won't listen and decides to land to which Jake tells Sparky they have to extend the runway and need to make a dragline. After Wilbur lands, Jake gets a ramp for [[Bernard (The Rescuers)|Bernard]] and [[Miss Bianca|Bianca]] to get off Wilbur and when he sees Miss Bianca he becomes smitten by her to which Sparky lets out a buzz knowing what's happened to Jake. Then Wilbur realizes that he has back pain from landing and Jake orders Sparky to watch the tower while he, Bianca, and Bernard get Wilbur to the hospital.\n\nSparky isn't seen after this for the rest of the film, so it is assumed that he is still watching the tower and waiting for Jake to return from helping Bernard and Bianca.\n\n{{The Rescuers}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:The Rescuers characters]]\n[[Category:Australian characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Flies]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]"
