He is never mean-spirited, but he\u2019s easily led and gullible. Bob follows Toshiaki everywhere, but is the first one to run to Victor for help when he gets in over his head.\n== Appearances ==\n\n=== ''[[Frankenweenie]]'' ===\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nBob Frankenweenie Artwork.png\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the film, Bob experiments with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea-Monkeys Sea-Monkeys], which mutates them from normal brine shrimp to [[Sea Creatures | strange amphibious creatures]].
