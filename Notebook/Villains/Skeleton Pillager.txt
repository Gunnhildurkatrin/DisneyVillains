They would be part of a party of pirates that travelled to the [[Dead Man's Cove]] of [[Isla Tesoro]] either to bury or unearth a treasure. Due to infighting for the treasure, the pillager along with at-least two of their comrades were killed.\n\nThe pillager's corpse would remain impaled on a nearby rock in the caverns with a seagull making its nest on his hat. It is implied that due to the supernatural nature of the grotto, the skeleton is haunted.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===[[Pirates of the Caribbean (attraction)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]===\nThe pillager appeared in the Dead Man's Cove segment of the original ride, being impaled on a rock nearby a beach. As guests pass by, a seagull perched on a nest in the pillager's hat squawks at them.\n\n===[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Battle for the Sunken Treasure]]===\nThe pillager appears in [[Jack Sparrow]]'s cave in this attraction, impaled against a mast rather than a rock.\n\n==Other Appearances==\n\n===[[Kinect Disneyland Adventures]]===\nThe pillager is among the undead skeletons who attack the protagonist and [[Black Barty]] in this video-game with the pillager even having the seagull nest on their hat.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In Disneyland, the pillager was originally portrayed by an authentic human-skeleton from the UCLA medical centre due to the limitations of props at the time. While the original skeletons were mostly removed, it has been put forwards that remnants of the original bones remain, including those of the pillager.\n*Cut dialogue for the skeletons would have had the pillager voiced by either [[Paul Frees]] or [[J. Pat O'Malley]].\n*Unused concept art showed the pillager and the other nearby skeletons amongst a treasure dug up by the pirate queens [[Anne Bonny]] and [[Mary Read]].\n*A [[2006]] action-figure identified the skeleton as, \"The Pillager\".\n*From [[2011]]-[[2018]], the pillager was seen alongside a [[Mermaids of Whitecap Bay|mermaid]]'s skeleton and a glass coffin from ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides]]'' as the song ''[[My Jolly Sailor Bold|Jolly Sailor Bold]]'' from the film played.\n*The skeleton is referenced in ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]'' when [[Hector Barbossa|Barbossa]] stabs Jack through the chest after Jack stole one of the [[Treasure of Cort\u00e9s|medallions]].When it is revealed that Jack is an undead skeleton, he has Barbossa's cutlass wedged in his rib-cage, mirroring the skeleton from the original ride.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\n81cHOSaDANL.
