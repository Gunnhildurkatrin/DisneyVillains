He is the owner of \"Second Chance\" and a good friend, maybe love interest\u00a0of [[Chloe Simon|Chloe]]'s.\n\n==Role in the [[102 Dalmatians|film]]==\nKevin\u00a0works at the Second Chance animal shelter and\u00a0is friends with [[Waddlesworth]], [[Drooler]], and\u00a0''The Gang''. He is\u00a0first seen playing tug-of-war with Drooler. However, when\u00a0Kevin seems close to winning the\u00a0match, the dogs mount up to have Drooler win, with Drooler himself shaking his slobber onto Kevin. He later meets [[Chloe Simon|Chloe]]\u00a0and introduces the dogs to her, claiming that they have been able to help find homes for most of the dogs who arrive at Second Chance.\n\nLater, Kevin tries to ask Chloe on a date, and Waddlesworth realizes that he needs a little nudge, so after Kevin saves [[Oddball]], who nearly fell\u00a0out of an office\u00a0window,\u00a0and Chloe asks if there is any way she can say thanks, the macaw intervenes and\u00a0suggests dinner. Chloe and Kevin then\u00a0eventually go on\u00a0their date.\n\nKevin later gets set up by [[Cruella De Vil|Cruella]] who\u00a0spent community service at Second Chance.\u00a0She is able to trick the authorities into thinking that Kevin kidnapped [[Dalmatian Puppies|the puppies]] to frame her and collect the fortune. Fortunately, hearing all of the puppies possibly owned by different people around [[London]], Kevin escapes from prison with\u00a0Waddlesworth's help, and he later meets up with Chloe. They learn that Cruella is headed to [[Paris]] and decides to follow her. However, they are soon captured by Cruella and imprisoned in her fur coat factory.\u00a0\n\nHowever, [[Alonzo]], Cruella's former servant\u00a0who helped with the theft of the puppies, decides that he doesn't want to work with Cruella anymore and reforms by\u00a0helping Chloe and Kevin escape. Near the end of the film, Chloe and Kevin receive an $8,000,000 paycheck from Alonzo for the dog shelter - on the judge's orders, all of Cruella's money had gone to the dogs' homes of the borough of Westminster - of which \"Second Chance\" was the only one. Kevin then notices\u00a0a few spots\u00a0on Oddball's body, which turn out to be real, and he and Chole congratulate Oddball for having her first spots.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"180\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nChloe and Kevin on a date.JPG|On a date with Chloe\n102-dalmatians-disneyscreencaps.com-10523.jpg|Kevin and Chloe kiss\n102-dalmatians-disneyscreencaps.com-10563.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Template:101 Dalmatians}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Shepherd, Kevin}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:101 Dalmatians characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]"
