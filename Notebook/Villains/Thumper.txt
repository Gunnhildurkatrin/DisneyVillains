That's why they call me Thumper.|Thumper}}\n\n'''Thumper''' is one of the deuteragonists of [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[1942]] animated feature film, ''[[Bambi (film)|Bambi]]''. He is a rabbit known and named for his habit of thumping his left hind foot.\n\n==Background==\nThumper is a young, comical rabbit and is also a well-known inhabitant of the forest. Despite being mistaken for a female by viewers, he is actually male. He was the first and closest friend of Prince Bambi, whom he sees as great potential for amazing things; taking the young fawn \"under his wings\" and teaching him the ways of the forest, to some extent.\n\n===Development===\nThe character was an important influence on the development of the 1942 film ''Bambi'' which started production with an adult tone that seemed too serious and non-commercial. As voiced by then 4-year-old Peter Behn, the vivacious character of Thumper was expanded from its original minor role and led to a focus on the young animals in the story.\n\n===Personality===\nUnlike Bambi, Thumper can be rather mischievous but ultimately means well. He often gives his close friends advice on a handful of topics but they usually get them into trouble. As a young adult, he hasn't changed much and continues to speak rather loud and thumps his left or right foot.\n\n=== Physical Appearance ===\nThumper is a rabbit kitten with gray fur, hazel eyes, a white tail, a white muzzle, white insicors, a white patch of fur on his chest, and a white muzzle. The insides of his long ears and his nose are pink, his cheeks, feet, belly, and the areas around his eyes are cream. His paw pads are pink. As a kitten, Thumper's left insicor is missing, whereas as a buck, he has both insicors and a set of whiskers.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Bambi (film)|Bambi]]''===\nOne beautiful day in the forest, a doe gave birth to [[Bambi (character)|Bambi]], the young prince of the forest. Thumper and Bambi quickly form a friendship, and Thumper takes it into his hands to teach Bambi the ropes, such as how to walk and talk. During one of these lessons, Bambi and Thumper meet and befriend a skunk named [[Flower]]. On another day, Bambi is out with his mother when Thumper appears again, telling him to eat blossoms and not grass. However, Thumper's mother forces him to eat the grass as well, being that it's healthier.\n\nDuring the winter, Thumper teaches Bambi how to ice-skate, which proves to be rather difficult for the young prince. Later on, [[Bambi's mother]] is tragically killed by Man.\n\n[[File:Bambi-teenage-thumper.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Young Adult Thumper in the original film.]]\nThe next scene takes place years after with a now young adult Thumper, Bambi, and Flower. It is Springtime and [[Friend Owl]], a good friend to Bambi's family, warns the trio about the \"dangers\" of becoming twitterpated (falling in love). The three claim they'll never fall victim to this, and make their way through the forest.\n\nAs their walk becomes longer, Flower falls for a [[Bluebelle|female skunk]]. Disgusted by the sight, Thumper and Bambi continue on. Eventually, a [[Miss Bunny|female bunny]] becomes smitten with Thumper, and she begins to flirt, luring him into her lap. Soon after, Bambi would fall for his childhood friend [[Faline]]. Sometime after, Thumper has revealed to have children of his own, as well as Flower. Both newly named fathers make way for Faline's den to witness the birth of Bambi's children, with Bambi now assuming the role as Great Prince of the Forest.\n\n===''[[Bambi II]]''===\n[[File:Thumper2.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Thumper in ''Bambi II''.]]\nThe events in ''[[Bambi II]]'' take place after the death of Bambi's mother but before Bambi's young adulthood. With his mother gone, Bambi is to live with his father, [[The Great Prince of the Forest]], until a suitable replacement mother is found. During this time, Bambi finds it to be very difficult to connect with his father, and Thumper offers to help. Throughout the film, Thumper gives Bambi lessons on how to impress the Great Prince and prove that he can be mighty as well.\n\nAs a side plot in the film, Thumper is constantly being followed by his sisters, though he finds them to be rather annoying. At the climax of the film, Man's dogs hunt down Bambi, and Thumper pitches in to help by telling Flower to make his \"brave face\" which causes him to let out his stink.\n\nIn the end, Thumper tells the story of the climactic dog chase to Faline, and other members of the forest, though he exaggerates it to make him seem like more of the hero.\n\n===Other appearances===\nThumper was set to have his own show as a part of [[The Disney Afternoon]] block entitled ''Thumper's Thicket'', although the idea for the show never really developed and is one of few ideas for Disney Afternoon shows that never made it off the drawing board.\n\nIn the [[1988]] feature film, ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', [[Roger Rabbit]] mentions his uncle Thumper, implying that Roger Rabbit might be Thumper's nephew.\n\nIn ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'', Thumper makes two cameos in the [[Donald Duck]] short \"[[Donald's Charmed Date]]\".\n\nThumper makes numerous cameo appearances in the animated series ''[[House of Mouse]]''. In the episode \"[[Timon and Pumbaa]]\", Thumper was going to be used by [[Timon]] for his \"pull a rabbit out of a hat\" trick, though Thumper thumped Timon's face and ran off. In the episode \"[[Pete's House of Villains]]\", he and Bambi were angered when [[Pete]] insulted Flower by saying that the club stinks, especially him.\n\nIn ''[[Enchanted]]'', a rabbit resembling Thumper appears at the beginning of the 2D-animated portions of the film.\n\nThumper makes an appearance in the ''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]'' episode \"[[Duck the Halls: A Mickey Mouse Christmas Special]]\", where he and Bambi are seen on an ice-skating rink.\n\nIn ''[[Ralph Breaks the Internet]]'', a ''Bambi'' poster featuring Thumper, Flower, and Bambi can be seen in a young Disney fan's bedroom.\n\n==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==\n[[File:Thumper DP.jpg|thumb|250px|Thumper at Walt Disney World]]\nThumper appears at the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts as a meetable character.\n\nDuring his early appearances, when Flower also appeared, Thumper used to appear in his child form, though as the years passed, the costume used was changed to his adult form, as shown by him now having both his buck teeth, his more developed neck frill, and the fact he is now found with or without Miss Bunny.\n\n===[[Disneyland]]===\nIn [[Disney California Adventure]], Thumper makes an appearance in Winter Dreams, the winter-themed rendition of the nighttime spectacular [[World of Color]].\n\n===[[Walt Disney World]]===\nThumper and his wife appeared in the \"Valentine's Day\" edition of the nighttime show [[Celebrate the Magic]] at the [[Magic Kingdom]]. Thumper has his own spell card in the attraction [[Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom]] known as \"Thumper's Mighty Thump\".\n\nDuring the EPCOT Flower and Garden Festival, Thumper has his own topiary located in [[Future World]].\n\nThumper also appears in the bubble montage in [[Fantasmic!]], and in the Walt Disney World Easter Parade.\n\n===[[Hong Kong Disneyland]]===\nThumper and Bambi can be found in the [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] version of [[It's a Small World]].\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*According to a line spoken by [[Roger Rabbit]] in ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', he has an uncle named Thumper. Roger also said that Thumper had prostate (which he misinterpreted as \"probate\") trouble and had to take medication for it.\n*Thumper is mentioned in a first chapter of a Junie B. Jones book entitled, ''Junie B., First Grader: Dumb Bunny'', along with Bugs Bunny from ''Looney Tunes'', the Bionic Bunny from ''Arthur'', Buster Bunny from ''Tiny Toon Adventures'', the Trix rabbit, ''Tthe Velveteen Rabbit'', and Peter Rabbit.\n*Thumper was originally meant to have a much smaller role in Bambi, but when [[Ollie Johnston]] and [[Frank Thomas]] noticed how cute the voice actor sounded, they insisted he had a greater role.\n*Thumper is one of [[John Lasseter]]'s favorite Disney characters, to the point that Lasseter named [[Thumper (A Bug's Life)|one]] of the grasshoppers in ''[[A Bug's Life]]'' after him.\n*In reality, rabbits thump their feet when frightened.\n*Thumper was listed #44 in Empire Magazine's The 50 Best Animated Movie Characters.\n*In the 1963 Disneyland album ''Peter Cottontail'', one of the stories focuses on Thumper called \"The Story of Thumper\", narrated by [[Lucille Bliss]]. The story explains that Thumper used to thump uncontrollably when he was young before gaining control of it.\n**The album also reveals the names of his four sisters: Blossom, Violet, Nillie, and Frillie.\n*Thumper's original voice actor, Peter Behn, initially auditioned for the role of Bambi but was rejected. However, he was later chosen for the role of Thumper, based on his previous audition.\n*Thumper's father was originally meant to appear in the film but was scrapped.\n\n{{Bambi}}\n{{DisneyTsumTsum}}\n{{Mickey Mouse (TV series)}}\n[[es:Tambor]]\n[[fr:Panpan]]\n[[it:Tamburino]]\n[[ja:\u3068\u3093\u3059\u3051]]\n[[nl:Stampertje]]\n[[pt-br:Tambor]]\n[[ru:\u0422\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0442\u0443\u043d]]\n[[zh:\u6851\u666e]]\n[[Category:Bambi characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Rabbits]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Spell Cards characters]]\n[[Category:Empire 50 Best Animated Characters]]\n[[Category:Uncles]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Deuteragonists]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse Works characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Disney Dreams! characters]]\n[[Category:Raw Toonage Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Wonderful World of Color]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse (TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Magic Kingdoms characters]]\n[[Category:Wreck-It Ralph cameos]]\n[[Category:Who Framed Roger Rabbit cameos]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]"
