Even though he is not completely evil, he is sensitive and temperamental. Also, he possesses a deep love for the game of soccer, as seen when the royal championships on his Island could not continue when a suitable referee couldn't be found. He was extremely aggressive and roared at everything that moved.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nKing Leonidas looks similar to [[Prince John]] from ''[[Robin Hood (film)|Robin Hood]] ''and [[Shere Khan]] from ''[[The Jungle Book]]'', but has a mane, a royal gold crown, and wears a king's red robe.\n\n===Abilities===\nKing Leonidas' voice is quite powerful, which can be expected from a royal lion. His yell to 'stop that ball' is powerful enough to blow everyone away to the net from its hurricane-like force.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]''===\nHe has an anti-human attitude, which may have stemmed from the fairy tale that animals staged a coup on [[the Isle of Naboombu]], killing the original leader, the human wizard [[Astoroth]]. He wears [[the Star of Astoroth]], a talisman that is needed to bring inanimate objects to life. After suffering much pummeling and stampeding at a soccer game, Mr. Brown succeeds in grabbing the Star of Astoroth from him. After being alerted by his secretary bird, an enraged Leonidas tries to pursue Mr. Brown, Miss Price, and the children, but he is foiled when he is turned into a rabbit, albeit one with a lion's tail, by Miss Price. He is last seen scurrying away. As Miss Price's rabbit spells are temporary, he presumably returned to his lion form soon after.\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\nKing Leonidas appeared in cameo with his servant The Secretary Bird from ''House of Mouse''.\n\n==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==\nShortly after the release of Bedknobs and Broomsticks, a costumed character version of King Leonidas was created. The costume itself is a reskinned variation of the [[Tigger]] costume that was originally made for [[Disney on Parade (show)|Disney on Parade]] as well as the parks. Coincidentally, King Leonidas would appear in the aforementioned show by 1974.\n\n===[[Disneyland]]===\nOne of King Leonidas' first appearances at Disneyland was in the [[Main Street Electrical Parade]]'' ''during it's original showings between [[1972]] - [[1996]]'', ''where he could be seen in the Dumbo Circus unit on a calliope float. He was still seen on the calliope from 2001 to 2008 when the parade ran at [[Disney California Adventure|Disney's California Adventure]] (under \"Disney's Electrical Parade\"). Unfortunately, the Dumbo unit was retired for unknown reasons along with King Leonidas in 2009, never being seen in the parade since then.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*King Leonidas as a rabbit has a similar look to [[Skippy]] from ''[[Robin Hood (film)|Robin Hood]]''.\n*He is named after the famous King of Sparta who fought in the Second Persian War. In Greek, Leonidas means \"Son of Lion\"\n*King Leonidas shares some of the same facial design as [[Shere Khan]] from ''[[The Jungle Book]]''.\n*In the reference art of King Leonidas along with the end credits of ''Bedknobs and Broomsticks'', he is referred to as both '''King Lion''' or simply '''Lion''' possibly implying that Leonidas became his official name afterwards and because his name was never heard in the film.\n*Given that [[the Star of Astoroth]] returned to his world as soon as it was brought into the real world, presumably Leonidas got his family's relic back.\n*King Leonidas has the loudest cry in all of Disney because when he yelled loudest \"!!! Give me the .... ball !!!\" Given that other characters screaming, it is not strong at all compared to his.\n\n{{Bedknobs and Broomsticks}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Leonidas}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Kings]]\n[[Category:Lions]]\n[[Category:Bedknobs and Broomsticks characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters in live-action films]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Rabbits]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
