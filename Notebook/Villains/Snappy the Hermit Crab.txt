He is also good friends with [[Marina]] and [[Stormy]].\n\n==Role in the series==\nSnappy first appeared in the episode [[The Old Shell Game]] After thwarting [[Captain Hook]]'s plan to steal the shell from the sea pups. Jake and his crew return to [[Pirate Island]], where they learn the shell was the home of a Hermit Crab, so Izzy set him free.\n\nThe Hermit Crab would later return in the episode \"[[The Mermaid's Song]].\" In the episode, the crab's name was revealed as Snappy as he tagged along with [[Stormy]] the mermaid as her brief partner-in-crime while the young mermaid used the power of the \"Mermaid's Song\" to hypnotize Captain Hook, [[Mr. Smee]], and [[Cubby]]. Snappy the Hermit Crab would later rush off to warn Marina about her sister abusing the power of the Mermaid's Song.\n\nSnappy makes a brief cameo in the episode \"[[Captain Who?]]\" as Jake and his crew tries to restore Captain Hook's memory. Snappy makes a brief appearance at the end of \"[[Treasurefalls!]]\" retrieving Cubby's lost Skull-N-Bones marble from the bottom of Never Sea, and returns it back to Cubby.\n\nSnappy reappears in the episode \"[[Jake's Royal Rescue]]\" rehearsing a song with [[Sandy the Starfish]] and Stormy in [[Queen Coralie]] honor held at [[Hidden Cove]]. After Queen Coralie is rescued by Jake and his crew from Captain Hook and return to Hidden Cove, Snappy can be spotted successfully singing with Sandy, Marina, Stormy, and the [[Mermaids (Peter Pan)|mermaids]].\n\n==Episode Appearances==\n*''[[The Old Shell Game]]''\u00a0(first appearance)\n*''[[The Mermaid's Song]]''\n*''[[Captain Who?]]''\u00a0(cameo)\n*''[[Treasurefalls!]]''\n*\"[[Jake's Royal Rescue]]\"\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"200\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\n108469115.png\nSnappy02.jpg\nSnappy03.jpg\nSnappy the hermit crab.jpg\nStormy01.jpg\nStormy02.jpg\nStormy03.jpg\nCollectseashells.png\nStormysinging.jpg\nStormy06.jpg\nStormy07.jpg\nStormy14.jpg\nStormy15.jpg\nStormy16.jpg\nStormy17.jpg\nStormy20.jpg\nStormy21.jpg\nMarina08.jpg\nMarina09.jpg\nMarina10.jpg\nMarina11.jpg\nMarina12.jpg\nSnappy04.png\nHook&amp;Snappy.png\nSnapshot 140 (12-24-2013 12-48 PM).png\nSnappy05.png\nSnappy06.png\nSnappy& Stormy- The Mermaid's Song.jpg\nHook&amp;Snappy-Jake's Awesome Surprise.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Jake and the Neverland Pirates}}\n[[Category:Jake and the Never Land Pirates characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Crustaceans]]"
