He is portrayed by [[Bobb'e J. Thompson]].\n\n==History==\nHe is [[Eddie Thomas|Eddie]]'s next-door neighbor, who is obsessed with [[Raven Baxter|Raven]]. He has a frenemy relationship with Eddie and [[Cory Baxter|Cory]], although he is usually seen scamming them. Stanley was originally brought in as a love interest for Raven's next-door neighbor, Sierra, but he becomes much more interested in Raven, and in one episode, [[Loca]]. Stanley is rude, obnoxious, mean, sarcastic, and deceptive to everyone. He is a young salesman, who usually tricks Cory into buying something that would eventually go wrong. Stanley is always trying desperately to get Raven to like him, but he suddenly leaves her alone after seeing her kiss Andre in the episode \"[[Mr. Perfect]]\". He loves to eat cheese sandwiches. He also competes against [[Chelsea Daniels|Chelsea]] in a ping-pong match, and loses. In the same episode (\"[[Taken to the Cleaners]]\"), he asks [[Victor Baxter|Victor]] to make him a cheese sandwich in the shape of a ping-pong paddle. His catchphrases include \"My brotha!\", which he exclaims whenever he is trying to \"show someone up\"; and \"I may have said that, but I say a lot of things.\" This is a partial denial of his ability to be nice to other people. He also appeared in the Cory in the House episode \"Uninvited Pest\" when he covets the Presidential medal Cory was going to receive for his Young Businessperson of the Year project. He got into the \"Up with Goodness\" program, feigned an ankle injury, and stole Cory's presentation. It is also noted that he has cartilogenophobia, the fear of bones, which helps Cory prove that Stanley faked the injury and stole his presentation.\n\n===Personality===\nHe is just like any other little kid, but likes selling stuff to costumers (mostly, Cory though). He likes to rip Cory off (which Cory doesn\u2019t like one bit).\n\n===Sayings===\nStanley's catchphrases are \"I may have said that, but I say a lot of things\", and \"My Brotha\".\n\n==Appearances==\n===''That's So Raven''===\n*\"[[Opportunity Shocks]]\"\n*\"[[Taken to the Cleaners]]\"\n*\"[[The Grill Next Door]]\"\n*\"[[Mr. Perfect]]\"\n*\"[[The Four Aces]]\"\n*\"[[Driving Miss Lazy]]\"\n*\"[[Sister Act (That's So Raven)|Sister Act]]\"\n*\"[[That's So Suite Life of Hannah Montana|Checkin' Out]]\"\n*\"[[Fur Better or Worse]]\"\n*\"[[When 6021 Met 4267]]\"\n\n===''Cory In The House''===\n*''[[Uninvited Pest]]''\n\n<br />\n\n= Trivia =\nHe's similar to Rico from ''Hannah Montana''.\n<br />{{That's So Raven}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Stanley}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:That's So Raven characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Character stubs]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Cory in the House characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
