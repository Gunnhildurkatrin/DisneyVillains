They are some of the most popular and beloved Disney characters in history, being from the classic era of Disney animation. These characters include:\n*[[Mickey Mouse|<font color=red>Mickey Mouse</font>]]: The iconic leader of the Six, known for his kindness, resourcefulness and tendency to get into mischief.\n*[[Minnie Mouse|<font color=magenta>Minnie Mouse</font>]]: The sweet, caring and lovely leading lady of the gang and Mickey's true love.\n*[[Donald Duck|<font color=blue>Donald Duck</font>]]: Bad-tempered and often unlucky, he is the ever stubborn and ambitious go-getter of the gang.\n*[[Daisy Duck|<font color=purple>Daisy Duck</font>]]: The feisty, effervescent and fabulous diva of the gang, and the loving girlfriend to Donald; whose ambition matches that of her beau.\n*[[Goofy|<font color=green>Goofy</font>]]: The lovable, happy, dimwitted, and clumsy goof, who is known for his friendly, yet extremely na\u00efve nature.\n*[[Pluto|<font color=orange>Pluto</font>]]: Mickey's loyal and helpful pup, ready to please his owner and friends at anytime.\n\nIn products and events where Daisy is absent or before her debut, the group is referred to as '''The Fabulous Five'''.\n\nInterestingly, the original theatrical cartoon shorts never had all six characters appearing together. The original Fabulous Five all appeared together in ''[[On Ice]]'' and ''[[Hawaiian Holiday]]'', both of which preceded Daisy's introduction in ''[[Mr. Duck Steps Out]]'' (unless one counts [[Donna Duck]] from ''[[Don Donald]]'' as being the same character as Daisy).\n\nMany of their productions involve the presence of another important character, [[Pete]], especially when an antagonist is needed.\n\n==Productions starring the Sensational Six together==\n*''[[Mickey Mouse Revue]]'' (animatronic show, [[1971]])\n*''[[Magic Kingdom on Ice]]'' (live show, [[1983]])\n*''[[Mickey's Diamond Jubilee|Walt Disney's World on Ice: Mickey's Diamond Jubilee]]'' (live show, 1988)\n*''[[Walt Disney's World on Ice: 10th Anniversary]]'' (live show, [[1990]])\n*''[[World of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck]]'' (video game, [[1992]])\n*''[[Mickey no Tokyo Disneyland Daib\u014dken]]'' (video game, [[1994]])\n*''[[Mickey Mouse: Magic Wands!]]'' (video game, [[1998]])\n*''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'' (TV series, [[1999]]-[[2000]])\n*''[[Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas]]'' (direct-to-video film, 1999)\n*''[[Mickey's Racing Adventure]]'' (video game, 1999)\n*''[[Mickey's Speedway USA]]'' (video game, 2000)\n*''[[House of Mouse]]'' (TV series, [[2001]]-[[2003]])\n**''[[Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse]]'' (direct-to-video film, 2001)\n**''[[Mickey's House of Villains]]'' (direct-to-video film, [[2002]])\n*''[[List of Disney video games|Disney Sports series]]'' (2002)\n*''[[Kingdom Hearts (series)|Kingdom Hearts]]'' series (2002\u2013present)\n*''[[One Man's Dream II: The Magic Lives On!]]'' (live show, [[2004]])\n*''[[Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers]]'' (direct-to-video film, 2004)\n*''[[Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas]]'' (direct-to-video film, 2004)\n*''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]'' (TV series, [[2006]]-[[2016]])\n**''[[Mickey Mousekersize]]'' (TV shorts, [[2011]] - present)\n**''[[Minnie's Bow-Toons]]'' (TV shorts, [[2011]] - [[2016]], re-aired in [[2021]] - present)\n*''[[Kinect Disneyland Adventures]]'' (video game, 2011)\n*''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]'' (TV shorts, [[2013]]-[[2019]])\n*''[[Disney Magical World]]'' (video game, 2013)\n*''[[Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures]]'' (TV series, [[2017]] - [[2021]])\n**''Chip 'n Dale's Nutty Tales'' (Shorts, [[2017]] - [[2018]])\n**''[[Mickey Mouse: Hot Diggity Dog Tales]]'' (Shorts, [[2019]] - [[2021]])\n*''[[Mickey Go Local]]'' (TV series shorts, [[2019]]-[[2020]])\n*''[[Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway]]'' (Theme Park Attraction, [[2020]])\n*''[[The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse]]'' (TV series, [[2020]]-present)\n*''[[Mickey Mouse Funhouse]]'' (TV series, [[2021]]-present)\n\n==Trivia==\n*The Sensational Six is likely a pun on the Marvel villain group, The Sinister Six.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\">\nRoyandmickeyandfriends.jpg|The Sensational Six, as they appeared in ''Mickey Mouse Works'', with [[Roy E.
