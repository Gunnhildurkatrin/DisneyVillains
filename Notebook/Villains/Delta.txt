He is absent from the third film.\n\nSimilar to Sebastian and Bimini, he is only seen at the beginning and end of the first film. Delta is first seen at the dog groomer with [[Chloe]] and Bimini, and then again when the three of them are relaxing by the pool. He is seen again at the end of the film, having gotten a spot on a dance show with Sebastian and Bimini.\n\nHis role is slightly enlarged in the second film. Here he attends Papi and Chloe's wedding with Sebastian and Bimini, and was seen watching the dog show on TV.\n\n{{Beverly Hills Chihuahua}}\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Beverly Hills Chihuahua characters]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]"
