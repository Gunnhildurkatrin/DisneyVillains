"[[File:Street-thugs.png|thumb|250px]]\nThe\u00a0'''Street Thugs'''\u00a0are a trio of recurring unnamed villains from the [[Disney Television Animation|Disney]] animated television cartoon series, ''[[Gargoyles]]''.\n\n==History==\nLike most stereotypical thugs, the trio is extremely aggressive, extremely loud, and extremely stupid, roughly in that order. They are also cowards who have only ever been seen harassing people that they see as weaker than themselves.\n\nOften scared away or beaten without effort, these three thugs are certainly not the most threatening opponents the clan has faced, but did seem to have a talent for attracting their attention as no matter where these bullies cropped up, they'd find themselves defeated by the defenders of the night.\n\nA different group of street thugs has appeared in the episode \"[[M.I.A.]]\" in [[London]]. The [[Manhattan Clan]] encountered the group and attacked the three. The thugs are seen near the end of the episode when Goliath brought Griff back to [[1996]], where the London Clan scares them off to protect the streets of London from thugs.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Gargoyles}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Gargoyles characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Character trios]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]"
