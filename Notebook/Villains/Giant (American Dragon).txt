"[[File:Giant.png|thumb|97px|Season 1]]'''Giants''' are magical creatures that look exactly like humans, only bigger. They first appear in \"[[Old School Training]]\" (Season 1) and make recurring appearances throughout the series, including Season 2.\n==Physical Appearance==\n[[File:Giant2.jpg|thumb|left|93px|Season 2]]\n\nIn Season 1, Giants have the exact same characteristics as regular humans, except for their height. Kids can stand up to twice an adult human's size while grown-up Giants can be at least three to five times taller. They are seen wearing modern clothes such as overalls, shirts, and pants. Some Giants can also go barefoot.\n\nIn Season 2, Giants get a rather drastic redesign. Their skin ranges from greyish to greenish, and their shapes have become sharper and edgier. They have more muscles (including females), pointy ears, and usually wear tunics with matching pants, a leather belt, and arm bracers.\n==Life in the Magical World==\nGiants usually live in small communities in secluded areas, such as caves and forests. They rarely wonder far from their home and are wary of outsiders. Giants are peaceful by nature and would never hurt anyone on purpose. Ironically, they possess superhuman strength. They also seem to be in good terms with other magical creatures, although they are often considered not very smart.\n==Known Giants==\n[[File:Hobbie_closeup.png|thumb|112px]]\n\nAlthough many Giants exist, only two were formerly introduced in the series:\n\nThe first is Hobie, an eight-year-old Giant that aspires to become a wrestling champion. He only appears in \"Ring Around the Dragon\" in Season 1. He runs away from home in order to fulfill his dream, and manages to attain the top wrestling spot in a short time. But, after a series of events, Hobie goes back home to save his parents who were captured by his wrestling manager. He then puts his career aside and remains home.\n\n[[File:Bertha_closeup.png|thumb|left|101px]]The second one is [[Bertha]], a simple female Giant that first appeared in \"[[Eye of the Beholder]]\" (Season 1) as a beauty pageant contestant. She takes on a bigger role in \"[[The Hunted]]\" (also Season 1) where she is captured by the [[The Huntsclan|Huntsclan]] along with other magical creatures for a hunting contest. She helps [[Jake]] and her other companions escape the Huntsman thanks to her extremely smelly feet. Bertha returns in Season 2 in \"Family Business\", but only as a minor character (and with an entirely new look befitting the Season 2 animation).\n==Trivia==\n*Instead of coins, Giants have a currency based on fish.\n*In \"Ring Around the Dragon\", a Giant named Grinter Axgrind is CEO of a company called ''Giantastic Toys'' which sells a line of Petunia dolls.\n*They're interested in Leprechaun gold.\n{{Template:American Dragon: Jake Long}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:American Dragon: Jake Long characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
