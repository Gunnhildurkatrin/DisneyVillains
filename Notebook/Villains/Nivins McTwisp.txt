He is next seen leading Alice along with the others to see [[Absolem]] and to unroll and read the Oraculum. As the [[Bandersnatch]] arrives, McTwisp is captured along with several others and taken to serve the [[Red Queen]]; when serving her, in the film he is seen finding the Hedgehog which she uses to play croquet. Further into the film, McTwisp is seen stealing the Oraculum from the Queen and then telling Alice where the [[Vorpal Sword]] was; where the Bandersnatch slept. Near the end of the film before the battle, he is seen announcing the battle between the Red and [[White Queen]] and then fleeing as he sees the [[Jabberwocky]].\n\n===''[[Alice Through the Looking Glass]]''===\nNivins returns in this film where Alice returns back to Underland during a conversation with the White Queen in Underland where it is explained that Tarrant Hightopp, the Mad Hatter, is in risk of dying. When Alice returns and reports the sad news about the Hatter, Nivins and the rest of Alice's friends react in worry and fear that they would lose their best friend if he dies. Alice is then tasked to travel back in time to find the Hatter's missing family and save his life before he dies to which Alice and her friends travel to Time's Castle to help save the Hatter who is in the risk of dying by using a Chronosphere to travel to the past Horunvendush Day event and save the Hatter's family from death before it is too late, just as Alice's friends wish her good luck in helping save the Hatter.\n\nAs the lapse in Underland becomes disastrous due to Alice taking the Chronosphere, Thackery and the rest of Alice's friends react in shock due to Alice taking the Chronosphere from the Grand Clock of All Time as the White Queen hopes Alice returns in time.\n\nIn the present, Nivins and the rest of Alice's friends are gathered near Tarrant lying in his bed gazing at the Hatter who is in the risk of dying just as he and the rest of Alice's friends mournfully leave as the Hatter's hair becomes completely white. Alice manages to save the Hatter from dying when she talks about his missing family still alive just as the Hatter happily wakes up.\n\nAfter the Hatter is brought back to life and Alice makes a plan to find his missing family, Nivins and the rest of Alice's friends arrive at the Red Queen's castle to find the Hatter's family  to make him feel happy. Upon arriving, they end up getting jailed by the Red Queen in a jail made of vegetables, much to the Red Queen's notorious plans. Ultimately, a vegetable woman frees them from the jail cell, freeing Alice and her friends in a plan to return to take Time back to his castle and retrieve the Chronosphere to save Underland before it perishes. Nivins and the rest of Alice's friends end up getting engulfed by time rust along with everyone in Underland. With the Chronosphere back in place, Nivins is brought back to life along with everyone caught in time rust. Alice then leaves Underland just as Nivins watches Alice returning to the real world alongside the rest of Alice's friends.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nWhiteRabbit.jpg\nNivens-McTwisp-White-Rabbit-Concept-Art-alice-in-wonderland-2010-11205475-563-675.jpg|An early concept art of 2010's White Rabbit.\nNivens-McTwisp-White-Rabbit-Concept-Art-alice-in-wonderland-2010-11205473-619-900.jpg|Another early concept of 2010's White Rabbit.\nVlcsnap-2012-12-30-15h27m07s112.png\nWhite-rabbit.jpg|Nivins McTwisp in ''[[Disney Universe]]''\nNivins McTwisp.png\nWhiteRabbit2010.jpg\nalice-in-wonderland-disneyscreencaps.com-1290.jpg\nalice-in-wonderland-disneyscreencaps.com-1291.jpg\nalice-in-wonderland-disneyscreencaps.com-1292.jpg\nalice-in-wonderland-disneyscreencaps.com-1293.jpg\nalice-in-wonderland-disneyscreencaps.com-1294.jpg\nalice-in-wonderland-disneyscreencaps.com-2044.jpg\nAlice in wonderland finale.jpg\nalice-in-wonderland-disneyscreencaps.com-2285.jpg\n7d198f90-83d9-11e5-8fe0-54c761f0e0c7.jpg\nAlice Through The Looking Glass! 100.png\nAlice Through The Looking Glass! 101.png\nAlice Through The Looking Glass! 112.png\nAlice Through The Looking Glass! 113.png\nAlice Through The Looking Glass! 118.png\nlate white rabbit.jpg\nrunning white rabbit.jpg\nAlice in Wonderland - Table.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:McTwisp, Nivins}}\n\n{{Alice in Wonderland}}\n{{Disney Crossy Road}}\n[[Category:Rabbits]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Servants]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Crossy Road characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]"
