He is a mischievous, orphaned pickpocket.\n\n==Role in the film==\nPaco ran away from an unnamed orphanage and started living on the streets pick pocketing to survive. He first met [[Pete Stancheck]] and [[Davy Johns]] when they were trying to find the place they would pick up [[Herbie]]. As he helped them he snatched their wallets and also stole the wallets belonging to [[Prindle]], [[Quinn (The Love Bug)|Quinn]] and [[Shepard]] which had some important film on a the location of a lost Inca city. Prindle, Quinn and Shepard soon began a manhunt for him and had the Mexican police on him. Herbie helped him escape by hiding under his hood. At the time the two became friends and he named Herbie \"Ocho\". \n\nHe was soon discovered by the crew and spent the rest of the cruise locked in the storeroom with Herbie until they arrived in a port where he would be taken back to his native country. Paco was very sad to see his friend get thrown overboard and was nearly captured by Prindle and Quinn after arriving in [[Panama]]. He managed to escape to the country where he was reunited with Herbie after swimming all the way from where he was dropped. He then painted Herbie crudely with the word \"TAXI\" saying he and Herbie will be going into the ridesharing business. Prindle and Quinn caught up with them and threatened to cut up Herbie unless he got the film he stole back. Paco and Herbie successfully got the film back but double-crossed Prindle and Quinn making a run for it. Paco was captured and brought along the search for the Inca City where he witnessed Prindle, Quinn, and Sherpard discover the gold. After they found what they were looking for they abandoned Paco in the jungle where he was lost and terrified by strange sounds. Herbie and the gang soon found him and together they stole the gold from the three men. When Prindle, Quinn, and Shepard stole the gold back, Paco and Herbie went after them and wrecked their plane, preventing them from escaping.\n\nBack on the ''Sun Princess, ''Pete and Davy, along with Louise, Melissa and Captain Blythe look with pride at a newly painted Herbie who is getting ready to race in the Brazilian Grand Prix, with Paco as the driver. Davy asks what is up with Paco calling Herbie \"Ocho\", as that is Spanish for eight. Paco looks at Herbie's 53 and says \"5 + 3 = 8!\"\n\n==Trivia==\n*Paco is short for \"Francisco\".\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nHerbie-goes-bananas-2-1.jpeg|Paco caught by Pete and Davy\nHerbie and Paco.jpg\nBattered up Herbie.jpg\nBananas (7).jpg|Hiding\nPaco 1.jpg\nPaco taking cash from stolen wallets.jpg\nI got another one.jpg|\"I gotta another one.\"\nHerbiegb16.jpg|\"Sorry.\"\nHerbiegb5.jpg\nHerbie-Goes-Bananas-11.png|\"Hit them again, Ocho!\"\nHerbiegb21.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Love Bug}}\n[[Category:Orphans]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:The Love Bug characters]]"
