She asks them for the help of [[Peter Pig]] and [[Donald Duck]], who feign bellyache. Having managed with her chicks, she returns to see the pig and the duck help in the picking. They redo the blow of the disease. This time, the hen realizes that they are liars, when one of the planks of their clubhouse came down after they come in and seeing them shaking hands. She contacts them again during the tasting, that they agree to volunteer. But the basket which she gives contains castor oil. She and her chicks have a fest to themselves.\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe Wise Little Hen resembles [[Clara Cluck]] even having the same voice actress (the cartoon was released a couple of months before Clara's Debut in [[Orphan's Benefit (1934)]]).\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\">\nTumblr n3qx7dPI111qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\nTumblr n6s3ajeLQO1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\nTumblr_n94p5tE5zC1r3jmn6o1_1280.png\nWISE_LITTLE_HEN.png\nTumblr_na7lfwpbf21r3jmn6o1_1280.png\nTumblr_nc6iwttAGH1qhcrb0o1_500.jpg\nTumblr nefuoi9I7j1r3jmn6o6 1280.png\nTumblr nefuoi9I7j1r3jmn6o4 1280.png\nTumblr nefuoi9I7j1r3jmn6o3 1280.png\nTumblr nefuoi9I7j1r3jmn6o2 1280.png\nTumblr nefuoi9I7j1r3jmn6o1 1280.png\nTumblr nefusb4beF1r3jmn6o3 1280.png\nTumblr nefusb4beF1r3jmn6o2 1280.png\nTumblr nefusb4beF1r3jmn6o1 500.png\nTumblr nefuewrrJU1r3jmn6o3 1280.png\nTumblr nefuewrrJU1r3jmn6o2 1280.png\nTumblr nefuewrrJU1r3jmn6o1 500.png\nTumblr_nefucmh72x1r3jmn6o1_1280.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wise Little Hen, The}}\n{{Silly Symphony}}\n[[Category:Chickens]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Silly Symphonies characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Farmers]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]"
