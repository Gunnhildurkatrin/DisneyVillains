Growing up around the most respected detectives in the world, she blossomed into an inquisitive youngster - so inquisitive, in fact, that [[Dorian Dickens|the Commodore]], despite some initial reluctance, allowed her to assist her mother and father on cases.\n\nShe quickly proved herself useful at detective work; the Commodore has praised her for her quick-witted and eagle-eyed examinations of clues. When she's not on a case she loves to read and has a great deal of technical knowledge that often comes in handy. She's managed to invent quite a few bits of technology to assist the Dickens family on cases - such as their handheld lie detectors.\n{{DEFAULTSORT: Johnson, Ling-Ling}}\n[[Category:Guilty Party characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Interactive Studios characters]]\n[[Category:Detectives]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Chinese characters]]\n[[Category:Inventors]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in video games]]\n[[Category:Orphans]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
