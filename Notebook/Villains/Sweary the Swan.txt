"[[File:Swerrytheswan.jpg|thumb|250px]]'''Sweary the Swan''' is a swan and [[Perry the Platypus]]' counterpart in the ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'' episode \"[[Steampunx]]\".\n\n==Biography==\nLike Perry, he is normally acting like a \"mindless swan\" in front of\u00a0[[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]]\u00a0and\u00a0[[Ferb Fletcher|Ferb]], but he has the double life of secret agent fighting\u00a0[[Heinz Doofenshmirtz|Professor Von Doofenshmirtz]]. He is frequently accused of swearing by everyone who hears him, hence the name \"Swear-y the Swan\" as Professor Von Doofenshmirtz points it out, though to the viewer's ear he seems to simply makes normal swan noises.{{CharacterStub}}\n\n{{PF-Wiki}}\n\n{{Phineas and Ferb}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Phineas and Ferb characters]]\n[[Category:Agents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Swans]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
