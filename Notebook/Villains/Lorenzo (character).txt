Throughout the short, Lorenzo is shown to be selfish to four other alley cats outside the restaurant. However, as the cats scatter due to Molly arriving, Lorenzo feels interested upon her without a tail and in spite of his stubbornness, he has a good interest in tango.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lorenzo]]''===\nLorenzo is introduced as a cat eating cocktail shrimp at a restaurant looking at four cats sadly watching him. He refuses to give some shrimp to one of them, so he draws a sad face on the wall in pout and scowl. However, a sinister black cat named [[Molly (Lorenzo)|Molly]] arrives and Lorenzo notices that she has no tail so he becomes influenced into her. His tail suddenly dances with him in a tango uncontrollably, causing him to escape the restaurant and dance across the street.\n\nWhile on a fountain, Lorenzo attempts to get rid of his tail, but the tail refuses to get off of its owner through many dangerous things that can be harmful to his tail such as a train, a power line, etc. When Lorenzo encounters Molly again with a knife, she gives him a negative influence towards him and his tail. Humiliated from all of this, Lorenzo sacrifices his own tail accepting the offer from Molly, causing his tail to be separated from him. Later, Molly, Lorenzo, and his own tail separated from Lorenzo himself dance together in a tango once again.\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Lorenzo}}\n\n{{Fantasia}}\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Fantasia characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]"
