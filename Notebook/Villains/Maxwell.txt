He worked as an assistant to [[Margot Yale]], but was also secretly a member of the Quarrymen. He tipped off John Castaway to Margot's plan to secretly send [[Angela]] and [[Bronx]] upstate by train. Castaway promised Maxwell a Silver Hammer at their next rally.\n\nSince Castaway was soon imprisoned, it can be safely assumed that Maxwell never got his Silver Hammer.\n\n{{Gargoyles}}\n{{CharacterStub}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Gargoyles characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Police officers]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]"
