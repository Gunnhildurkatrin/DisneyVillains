Since then, they have appeared in lots of comic strips, storybooks, and comic book stories starring Mickey Mouse and Pluto, but unlike [[Donald Duck]]'s [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|nephews]] and [[Max Goof|Goofy\u2019s son]], they have very rarely ever appeared in animation.\n\nMorty should not be confused with Mickey's [[Mortimer Mouse|often times rival of the same name]], or Minnie's wealthy rancher uncle [[Mortimer Mouse (Minnie's Uncle)|Mortimer]].\n\n==History==\nThe twins first appeared in ''Mickey's Nephews'' on September 18, 1932, introduced by Gottfredson as the children of the nanny-like Mrs. Fieldmouse (the character who was later retconned as [[Felicity Fieldmouse]], Mickey\u2019s older sister). The debut consisted of the boys getting into all sorts of trouble around Mickey's home until Mickey resorted to restraining and reading stories to the boys to keep them calm.\n\n[[File:tumblr_ljz4waQF5E1qhcrb0o1_500.jpg|thumb|left|The twins' first animated appearance in ''Mickey's Steamroller''.]]\nThe twins' first film appearance was the [[1934]] Mickey Mouse cartoon ''[[Mickey's Steamroller]]''. Aside from a cameo in [[1938]]'s ''[[Boat Builders]]'', they didn't appear in animation again until ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'' ([[1983]]), with Morty playing the part of [[Tiny Tim]] and Ferdie as the not-named-onscreen [[Peter Cratchit]].\n\nIn pre-World War II children's storybooks produced by the Disney studio, the nephews were usually called Morty and Monty rather than Morty and Ferdie. Very early books contain three or more nephews with various names, including Maisie and Marmaduke. Morty's name, short for Mortimer, is possibly in reference to the originally planned name for Mickey (Mortimer); and Ferdie (sometimes misspelled \"Ferdy\") is short for \"Ferdinand.\"\n\nFerdie disappeared from the ''Mickey Mouse'' comic strip in [[1943]] because Gottfredson thought the nephews were too much alike. He had plans to bring Ferdie back later as a bespectacled, intellectual, bookworm mouse with an Eton hat and coat, with the explanation that he had been away at school. However, Gottfredson never got around to bringing Ferdie back and Morty remained in the strip alone. Morty was occasionally depicted with his best friend named Alvin, and a sweetheart named Millie.\n\nIn recent years, some of Morty and Ferdie's comic book appearances have portrayed them as football players on the team Riverside Rovers. Their mother is depicted as a supportive \"Soccer Mom.\" Morty and Ferdie are also occasionally pitted against their antagonists, [[Pete]]'s twin hellion nephews, Pierino and Pieretto.\n\n==Television==\n===''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]''===\nMorty and Ferdie made a cameo appearance in the segment \"[[Around the World in Eighty Days]]\", which was later reused for the ''[[House of Mouse]]'' episode \"[[Mickey and Minnie's Big Vacation]]\".\n\n===''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]''===\nMorty and Ferdie appeared in the extended Halloween episode, \"[[The Scariest Story Ever: A Mickey Mouse Halloween Spooktacular]]\". In the special, they go trick-or-treating with [[Donald Duck|Donald\u2019s]] Nephews, [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]] and listen to Mickey's scary stories. This was the twins' first appearance in a TV series since ''Mickey Mouse Works'' and their first major role in the TV series.\n\n==Video games==\nMorty is a playable character on the PlayStation 2 game ''[[Disney Golf]]''. Both Morty and Ferdie were seen in the portal to [[Mickeyjunk Mountain]] in the [[2010]] game ''[[Epic Mickey]]''.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery widths=\"200\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nFourTales2.png|The twins (and an inexplicable third nephew) in \"[[Four Tales on a Mouse]]\".\nMickeys christmas carol 11large.jpg|Morty and Ferdie in ''Mickey's Christmas Carol''\nTumblr n7wbzfRx271qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg|The twins' cameo in \"[[Boat Builders]]\"\n1983-noel-3.jpg\nTumblr m2p1n8rghZ1r3jmn6o1 1280.png\nimageScariest Story Ever Mickey(4).jpg|Morty and Ferdie in ''The Scariest Story Ever: A Mickey Mouse Halloween Spooktacular''\nMichrymouseshort halloween.jpg\nScariestStoryEver 1.jpg\nScariestStoryEver 2.jpg\nScariestStoryEver 4.jpg\n</gallery>\n===Miscellaneous===\n<gallery widths=\"200\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nm-f mouse.png\n$ 12.JPG|A Mickey Mouse & Friends puzzle.\nMickey mouse comic 72.jpg\nGoofy magician.jpg\n1941_RKO_DIS.png\n1938CastellCrdGameB10.jpg\nLe journal de mickey 761.jpg\n9897562.jpg\nMickey_and_Friends_puzzle.jpg\nMicky maus 75-12.jpg\nPlutoandmonkey.jpg\nMorty_and_ferdie.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Although they were introduced before Huey, Dewey, and Louie, they have appeared far less often in animation than the latter trio.\n*Contrary to what was written in their profile in the book ''[[Disney Dossiers: Files of Characters From the Walt Disney Studios|Disney Dossiers]]'', they do not appear in ''[[Mickey's House of Villains]]'', though it is possible they could be among the [[Orphans (Mickey Mouse)|mouse orphans]] (with whom they share the same character design) seen in ''[[Gulliver Mickey]]'', ''Orphans' Benefit'', and ''[[Orphans' Picnic]]''.\n*Some merchandise for ''Mickey's Christmas Carol'' oddly refers to Morty's character only as Tiny Tim without mentioning Morty's name, even if the other characters have both their character and \"actor\" names listed.\n\n==External links==\n*{{Inducks character|id=MF}}\n{{Mickey Mouse & Friends}}\n{{Mickey Mouse Works}}\n{{Mickey Mouse (TV series)}}\n[[es:Morty y Ferdie]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fieldmouse, Morty and Ferdie}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Mice]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:Nephews]]\n[[Category:Twins and Triplets]]\n[[Category:Mickey's Christmas Carol characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse Works characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse (TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
