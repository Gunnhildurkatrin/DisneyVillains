His training was classical. He began pawing the ivories while a cub and practiced days and nights for many years. Finally, he went to New York, much to the relief of his neighbors. There he studied Bearlioz, and his favorite composition was \"Night on Bear Mountain.\" When he heard himself referred to as the \u201clard of Juilliard,\u201d he quit the concert stage and went home to the hills. He is highly regarded by the other musicians because he can play in a key other than C.''\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nGomer_Concept_Art.png|Concept art for Gomer by [[Marc Davis]].\nGomer_Original_WDW.png|Gomer pre-2012 refurbishment.
