However, his feelings can be easily hurt (as is evident when Jane ridicules his faith in the Peter stories Wendy tells him). He is also an innocent boy (as is made evident of his dislike of war and war devices, such as bomber planes and their bombs).\n\n===Physical appearance===\nDanny is slender with dirty blond hair, green eyes, green footie pajamas similar to his Uncle Michael's, and a cap similar to Peter Pan's.\n\n==Role in the film==\nDanny is first seen in Wendy's arms when she and family are looking at [[Neverland]]. He is also seen with her when [[Edward]] leaves for the war. In his next appearance, he and Wendy head to the bomb shelter and he expresses his fear of the bomber planes and bombs. She makes him feel better, resulting in him believing it's [[Captain Hook]]. Jane and [[Nana II]] arrive and Jane gives him socks as his birthday gift and he's initially not happy with them, but Wendy imagines them as Peter Pan and Captain Hook. She then tells him a story about Peter and when Jane says that she has no time for such activity, he informs her that's she's not fun anymore, even going so far as to mention that she herself had wanted to become the first Lost Girl. He is later taken to the [[Nursery|nursery]] by Jane, but he later argues with her about Peter's existence and sadly runs off. He is next seen with Wendy during the song \"[[I'll Try]]\", talking about Peter again.\n\nHe is also seen in flashbacks when Jane is by herself in Neverland and is thinking of home.\n\nHe is next seen near the end and is surprised by Jane's new attitude towards Peter. She then tells him the story of Captain Hook kidnapping her, at which he is fascinated and she also tells him about [[Tinker Bell]]. He is then seen at the window, seeing Peter for the first time. It is then that Edward returns home from the war and they go to greet him.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Danny resembles a palette swap of [[Michael Darling|Michael]], and he resembles [[Jim Jr.]] from ''[[Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure]]''. In addition, both characters share the same voice actor during the early 2000s, Andrew McDonough.\n*In the original story, Danny didn't exist because Jane is an only child (at least by the time the epilogue takes place).\n*Sometimes, Danny looks like a younger version of Peter Pan.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nDanny 1.jpg \n464516-disney-s-peter-pan-return-to-never-land-game-boy-advance-screenshot.png\n0303 - disney's peter pan - return to neverland (u) 07.png\n8_Return_to_Never_Land.jpg\n7\u044d.jpg\n4278.jpg\n23\u043f\u043f\u043f.jpg\n30.jpg\n22.jpg\n3467 1 screenshot.png\nSock puppet.png\nPeterpan2-disneyscreencaps com-7310.jpg\nPeterpan2-disneyscreencaps com-7336.jpg\nPeterpan2-disneyscreencaps com-699.jpg|Wendy telling Danny a story about Peter Pan\nJane tickling Danny.png|Jane tickling Danny\nJane telling Danny her story.png|Jane telling Danny her story\nPeterpan2-disneyscreencaps com-7139.jpg\nPeterpan2-disneyscreencaps com-7125.jpg\nPeterpan2-disneyscreencaps com-69.jpg|Wendy looking out the window at Neverland with Edward, Jane, and Danny\nTumblr.jpg\nMarch2nd.png|His page in [[Disneystrology]]\n</gallery>\n\n{{Peter Pan}}\n[[Category:Peter Pan characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:English characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]"
