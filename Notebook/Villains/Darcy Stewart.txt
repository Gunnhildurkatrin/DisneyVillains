"[[File:DarcyStewart.jpg|thumb]]'''Darcy Stewart''' is a young little girl who is best friends with [[Chloe James]]. She's portrayed by [[Ella Anderson]].\n\n==Character History==\nChloe and Darcy got along terribly until the girls bonded over, seemingly destroying their parents' friendship.\n\nChloe and Darcy manipulate Tyler into giving them what they want by telling him that Darcy doesn't like him and they seem to have become best friends.\n\n==Personality==\nDarcy is a little girl who is known to be very feisty. She is also very manipulative, and \"enjoys\" fighting Chloe. Darcy is not very good at not admitting she dislikes someone or something (as was the case when Tyler said some words that made her like him).\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Dog With a Blog}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stewart, Darcy}}\n[[Category:Dog with a Blog characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Nieces]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
