She is so creative, loves to draw, paint, and dance all at the same time. She is the smallest of the Muppet Babies group and has the biggest heart. Unlike the other main characters she was created specifically for the 2018 version of the show and has no real life puppet.\n==Background==\n===Development===\nSummer was conceived as a female character to balance out the ''Muppet Babies'' cast. The show's executive producer [[Tom Warburton]] reflects on the creation of Summer:\n\n{{quote|It was me and our art director Chris Moreno sitting in a room just doodling and drawing, and I came up with this little sketch of a lollipop-shaped penguin with a turtleneck. We probably did a hundred different characters trying to figure out who this was going to be, and when we came into [[Disney Junior]] with this penguin and a couple others, they immediately went to the penguin and said, 'That one.' We have that original drawing hanging in the studio now.|Tom Warburton}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nSummer Penguin Muppet Babies 2018 press sheet, Disney Junior.jpg\nMuppet Babies 2018 Eiffel Tower.jpg\nMbstandee.jpg\nMuppet Babies 2018 playtable.jpg\nMuppet Babies 2018 06.png\nMuppet Babies 2018 04.png\nMuppet Babies 2018 03.png\nMuppet Babies 2018 02.png\nMuppet Babies 2018 01.png\nMuppet Babies Dance Party on Tour.jpg\nMuppet Babies 2018 Disney Junior crew nikilytton 01.jpg\nMuppetBabies-(2018)-S02E10-FrostyLament.png\nMuppet Babies (2018) 29.png\nMuppet Babies (2018) 24.png\nMuppet Babies (2018) 23.png\nMuppet Babies (2018) 22.png\nMuppet Babies (2018) 21.png\nMuppet Babies (2018) 17.png\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n* [[w:c:muppet:Summer Penguin|Muppet Wiki: Summer Penguin]]\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{The Muppets}}\n{{Muppet Babies}}\n[[es:Summer Penguin]]\n[[pt-br:Pinguim Summer]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Penguins]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Muppet Babies characters]]\n[[Category:The Muppets characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Infants]]\n[[Category:Toddlers]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Artists]]\n[[Category:Dancers]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Detectives]]"
