The performances normally vary from a game show to a maintenance crew. Guests may also interact with the show, generally called up by the actors to join the show. The shows can perform in multiple areas at one time, and last normally about fifteen minutes. Their arrival is announced when a slow moving vehicle is seen traversing through the street, or an actor is seen setting something up, or if one is simply standing on the sidewalk.\n\nOn March 12, 2020, the show had its final performance at Disney's Hollywood Studios, due to the COVID-19 outbreak. \n\n== Details ==\nCitizens of Hollywood can occur in three areas: [[Hollywood Boulevard]], [[Sunset Boulevard]], and the entrance to [[Echo Lake]]. The actors can be differed from guests by wearing flamboyant costumes, and guests normally group around their area to see their performances. Characters can normally be found hiding in stores, or sometimes [[The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror|Tower of Terror]]'s unload before coming out to perform.\n\nThe performances they do are always comedic, generally containing either intentionally bad or clever puns. Certain shows have a repeated topic that is focused on, but the performance is different each time.\n\nThe show never performs in rain, and will put the performance to a halt if rain starts during their shows.\n\nOn October 27, 2020, following Walt Disney World's reopening after being temporarily closed during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Walt Disney World announced that all entertainment would be laid off, such as Citizens of Hollywood at Disney's Hollywood Studios and [[Monsters, Inc. Laugh Floor]] at Magic Kingdom, due to a dispute between the {{WikipediaLink|Actors' Equity Association}} and Walt Disney World.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogmickey.com/2020/10/equity-cast-members-notified-of-layoffs-at-disney-world/|title=Equity Cast Members Notified of Layoffs at Disney World}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://insidethemagic.net/2020/10/full-list-entertainment-layoffs-disney-world-ad1/|title=Full List of All Recent Disney World Entertainment Layoffs}}</ref>\n\n== Types of shows ==\n* Good Morning Hollywood on the corner of Hollywood and Vine\n* The Funniest Citizen of Hollywood competition (also known as 99)\n* The Hollywood Matchmaker game\n* The Red Carpet Radio Cavalcade\n* A magic trick table\n* The Hollywood Hot Seat\n\n== List of Characters ==\n* Sonny Burbank, the mayor\n* Jack Diamond, a talent agent.\n* Director Oscar Meyerwiener\n* Cloe Canard\n* Betty Shambles\n* Wink Wright, movie critic\n* Dara Vamp\n* Dorma Nesmond\n* Evie Starlight\n* Beau Wrangler, cowboy movie star\n* Montgomery Dash, movie star\n* Officer Percival Peabody\n* Officer William Club\n* Officer Prime Brody\n* Officer Pat Friskem\n* Paige Turner\n* Stone Granite\n* Ace Victory\n* Juan Scenario, a screenwriter\n* Phoebe Bizarre\n* Flora Fierra\n* Ginny Vermouth\n* Buddy Flowers\n**Note that the actors are never assigned to the same people, the person portraying them may be different on each of their appearances.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Adventurers Club]]\n\n{{Disney's Hollywood Studios}}\n[[Category:Hollywood Boulevard attractions]]\n[[Category:Disney's Hollywood Studios entertainment]]\n[[Category:Disney's Hollywood Studios attractions]]\n[[Category:Disney parks and attractions]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n<references />\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]"
