Somewhat horrified, Jack goes on to respond that she was looking great. At the end of the film her head can be seen hanging from Jack Sparrow's belt as he set out for the [[Fountain of Youth]].\n\n===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides]]' ===\nThroughout this film, Jack's mother can be seen hanging from his belt although her presence goes unacknowledged.\n\n==Printed media==\n===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Price of Freedom]]''===\nIn this book, Jack Sparrow's mother is said to have given birth to Jack during a hurricane.\n\n==[[Disney Parks]]==\n===[[The Legend of Captain Jack Sparrow]]===\nJack's mother appeared in this show where she hung from Jack's belt, again unacknowledged.\n\n===[[Trader Sam's|Trader Sam's Enchanted Tiki Bar]]===\nJack's mother makes a significant appearance in this bar at the [[Disneyland Hotel]]. Her shrunken head is on display in a box with a note from Jack addressed to his friend [[Trader Sam]], the proprietor of the Tiki Bar who himself practiced head-shrinking. According to the note, Jack's mother('s head) enjoyed spending time with Trader Sam which motivated Jack leaving her in Sam's ownership. The note reads, \"''Sam. Rum is on you, heads are on me.
