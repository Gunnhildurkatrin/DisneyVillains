His line in the short film: \"I need a gentle donkey to carry my wife to Bethlehem.\" says it all. Their son is Jesus.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[The Small One]]''===\nMary only appeared for a short while in the film, because she was seen at the very end. She was first seen with her husband,\u00a0Joseph,\u00a0riding on\u00a0Small One (bought by Joseph from [[The Boy|a boy]] earlier at night) while waving good-bye to the boy from a long distance and then,\u00a0continuing their journey to the stable in Bethlehem where [[Wikipedia:Star of Bethlehem|a bright star]] later shone; symbolizing the birth of their son, Jesus.\n\n===''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''===\nThe \"[[Hellfire]]\" sequence of the film consists primarily of [[Judge Claude Frollo|Frollo]]'s prayer to blessed Mary ever Virgin. Roman Catholics do pray to blessed her to ask her to pray to God on their behalf, and because of her absolute purity, she is the perfect saint to ask regarding his inappropriate attraction to [[Esmeralda]]. However, in so doing Frollo reveals himself to be filled with sinful pride, lust, envy, and vengefulness.\n\nEarlier in the film, [[Archdeacon|the Archdeacon]]\u00a0sang \"you can never run nor hide what you've done from the eyes, the very eyes of Notre Dame\". This was the his way of saying that, from Heaven, blessed Mary bore witness to Frollo's murder of [[Quasimodo]]'s parents, and thus he needed to do something to avoid being damned by her. This is what convinced him to adopt Quasimodo as his son.\n\n==Trivia==\n*During the making of the \"[[Night on Bald Mountain/Ave Maria|Ave Maria]]\" segment of ''[[Fantasia]]'', there were suggestions to have an image of the Virgin Mary appear in the last shot when it was intended to end with the monks (and possibly nuns) entering an actual church.{{The Hunchback of Notre Dame}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mary}}\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Semitic characters]]\n[[Category:Historical characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:The Small One characters]]\n[[Category:Holiday Figures]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters based on real people]]\n[[Category:Angels]]\n[[Category:Goddesses]]\n[[Category:Fantasia characters]]\n[[Category:The Hunchback of Notre Dame characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]"
