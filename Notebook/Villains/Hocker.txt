'''Experiment 051''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba_Jookiba|Jumba Jookiba]]\u00a0and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]]. He is designed to spit acidic saliva that can eat through solid matter. His one true place is with [[Mrs. Hasagawa]] as one of her \"cats\".\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment 051 was the 51st genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to spit acid saliva. 051 and the other first 625 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai. Against statistically unlikely (but not impossible) odds, several experiment pods landed in one location: [[Mrs. Hasagawa]]'s yard, 051's pod being one of them.\n\nAt an unknown point, [[Mrs. Hasagawa]] mistook 051's pod for an apricot and placed it in a colander for later consumption along with numerous other pods.\n\nAfter\u00a0[[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Stitch]] redecorated Mrs. Hasagawa's front yard without her permission, she was less than thrilled with the results, but decided to thank them for their hard work with the \"apricots.\" The pods were then revealed, but before Lilo and Stitch could stop her, she washed them with a watering can, thus activating the experiments.\n\nAfter his activation, 051 began to carry out his primary function by hocking acidic saliva at Lilo, only to miss and hit the [[Mrs. Hasagawa's House|house]] instead. Lilo and Stitch believed the experiments to be a danger to Mrs. Hasagawa and, along with [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] and [[Pleakley|Pleakley,]] decided to capture them all. 051 was then captured in a container by unknown means.\n\n051 and the other experiments were about to be taken away but were returned to Mrs. Hasagawa when Lilo and Stitch saw how much she cared for them. Later, Lilo apologized to Mrs. Hasagawa while the latter was petting 051, only for the experiment to spit acid at the wall. 051 was then named Hocker.\n\n===''[[The Origin of Stitch]]''===\nHocker was one of the experiments that was gliding on the screen, but he is 542 instead of 051.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nThe first 624 experiments, including Hocker, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]] and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nHocker participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]].\n\nThe Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In \"[[Mrs. Hasagawa's Cats]]\", Hocker's spots and stripes\u00a0are red. However, in ''[[The Origin of Stitch]]'' and ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]'', his spots and stripes are yellow.\n*Hocker's [[Experiment Pods|pod]] color is green.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nScreenCapture 20.png|Hocker's experiment pod\nvlcsnap-2012-07-01-22h19m19s44.png\nvlcsnap-2012-07-23-12h41m58s208.png\nVlcsnap-2012-12-23-10h18m00s53.png\nVlcsnap-2012-07-03-21h18m36s224.png\nVlcsnap-2012-08-02-20h56m43s41.png\nVlcsnap-2013-02-08-11h59m38s131.png\nVlcsnap-2012-08-02-18h57m33s14.png\nVlcsnap-2013-03-30-19h52m36s223.png\nScreenCapture 03.04.13 14-16-57.jpg\nVlcsnap-2012-07-03-22h16m18s43.png\nScreenCapture 22.12.13 14-35-10.jpg\nScreenCapture 04.03.13 10-47-42.jpg\nHocker (Kung Fu Pleakley) 001.png\nHocker (Kung Fu Pleakley) 002.png\nHocker (Kung Fu Pleakley) 003.png\nHocker (Kung Fu Pleakley) 004.png\nHocker (Kung Fu Pleakley) 005.png\nHocker (Kung Fu Pleakley) 006.png\nHocker (Kung Fu Pleakley) 007.png\nHocker (Kung Fu Pleakley) 008.png\nHocker (Kung Fu Pleakley) 009.png\nHocker (Kung Fu Pleakley) 010.png\nHocker (Kung Fu Pleakley) 011.png\nHocker (Kung Fu Pleakley) 012.png\nHocker (Kung Fu Pleakley) 013.png\nHocker (Kung Fu Pleakley) 014.png\nHocker (Kung Fu Pleakley) 015.png\nHocker (Kung Fu Pleakley) 016.png\nHocker (Kung Fu Pleakley) 017.png\nThe Origin Of Stitch Hocker.jpg|Misidentified as [[Bonnie (Lilo & Stitch)|Experiment 149]]\nThe Origin Of Stitch Hocker2.jpg|Misidentified as Experiment 542 (Hallie)\npanes16.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
