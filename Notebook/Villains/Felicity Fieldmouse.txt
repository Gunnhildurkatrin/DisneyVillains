While in the original English version she had no first name and was referred to as \"Mrs. Fieldmouse\", a Dutch translation of the same of the comic strip had Mickey referring to her as \"Amalia\" (Dutch spelling of \"Amelia\"). In these original strips, Mrs. Fieldmouse is not Mickey's sister; as drawn, she looks more like an elderly relative, and Mickey refers to her \"Mrs. Fieldmouse\" rather than her first name. However, the relationship was changed to a siblinghood when she was re-introduced in more recent comics. The fact that Mickey is Morty and Ferdie's maternal uncle was also indirectly confirmed by the fact that, in the [[1935]] ''Mickey Mouse'' one-pager ''He's a Knockout'', Mickey states that he does not have a brother.<ref>http://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=U+MMA++6B03</ref>\n\nAt Egmont Publishing, when her new design and characterization were fleshed out by Disney comic author Paul Halas and Disney comic artist Francisco Rodriguez, she was given the name Felicity Fieldmouse. As a side note, Egmont also named Felicity's husband\u2014the twins' father\u2014Frank, though he has yet to be specifically named or depicted in a published comic. Egmont's modern version of Felicity has slimmed down and is designed to look closer to Mickey in age while remaining significantly taller than him.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nMickey Mouse 282 19775.jpg\nMrsfieldmouse.jpg\nDk aa2002 19g 001.png\nMickey Mouse and Friends-261-18.jpg\nMickey Mouse and Friends-261-19.jpg\nMickey Mouse and Friends-261-20.jpg\nMickey Mouse and Friends-261-22.jpg\nMickey Mouse 282 17.jpg\nMickey Mouse 282 19.jpg\n09moeder.jpg\nHiirimamma.jpg\nEs jimiv 062b 001 mrsfieldmouse.jpg|\nMorty ferdie amelia.jpg|Mrs. Fieldmouse's early appearance as \"Mrs. Fieldmouse\".\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Mickey Mouse & Friends}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fieldmouse, Amelia}}\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Mice]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:News Reporters]]"
