Like his master he is depicted as an unattractive but lovable and jovial fool, drunkenly dancing around with everyone and having a good time. When [[Zeus (Fantasia)|Zeus]]\u00a0calls up a storm he and Bacchus are caught in the middle of it, tormented by the wind and his bolts of lightning. Both are washed away in a stream of wine when lightning strikes the grape tub they're hiding under, but forget the danger and merrily drink the wine they're sitting in. When the storm ends he and Bacchus toast [[Iris (goddess)|Iris]]\u00a0for coloring the wine in a beautiful rainbow pattern.\u00a0\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\nJacchus appeared with Bacchus in ''[[House of Mouse]]''.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink|Jacchus}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Jacchus was not in the original myth. He was an independent creation of Disney and a parody of the [[unicorns]] that appear in the film as well.\u00a0\n*Jacchus' name is basically Bacchus' name with a \"J\" replacing the \"B\". It also sounds similar to the insult/technical term for a donkey \"Jackass.\"\n*Jacchus is very similar in facial looks to [[Lampwick]] during the time the latter's head transforms into that of a donkey's until he completely transforms into one in which his head is now slightly more realistic.\n\n{{Fantasia}}\n{{CharacterStub}}\n[[Category:Fantasia characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Greek Mythology]]\n[[Category:Donkeys]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]"
