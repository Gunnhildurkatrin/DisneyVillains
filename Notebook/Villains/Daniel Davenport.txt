He has been living a normal life with an adopted family. He never knew that he had bionics until his siblings accidentally activated his chip while taking a group photo. It is revealed by [[Douglas Davenport|Douglas]] that Daniel has an ability called Power Replication. He can touch someone and have whatever ability he/she has. When he touches another person, the old ability is replaced with the new one. After Adam and Daniel stop the leak of the Hydro-Loop's fuel tank, Douglas apologizes to Daniel for lying about his bionics out of fear that he would freak out. Daniel decides to give Douglas a second chance. Before Daniel leaves back to the mainland, Douglas tells him that he can come back anytime. His original name was Subject D as he was the fourth bionic human that Douglas created.\n{{CharacterStub}}\n[[Category:Lab Rats characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Superheroes]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
