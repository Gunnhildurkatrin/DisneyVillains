He looks like an old man, except that below his waist is an elevator-like protrusion instead of feet. He has the ability to transport anybody who comes into the elevator to a completely different spot. He has disguised himself as an old man in an elevator, leaving many people inconspicuous.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Monster, Elevator}}\n{{Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go!}}\n[[Category:Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go! characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Monkeys]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Psychics]]\n[[Category:Article stubs]]"
