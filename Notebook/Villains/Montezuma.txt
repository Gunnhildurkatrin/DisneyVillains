"\n:''You may be looking for [[Montezuma (Chihuahua)]].''\n[[File:Cortes_vs_Montezuma.jpg|thumb|250px|Illustration from ''Pirates of the Caribbean: Jack Sparrow: The Sword of Cortes''.]]'''Moctezuma I''' (c. 1398-1469), also known as '''Motecuhzoma Ilhuicamina''', '''Huehuemotecuhzoma''', or '''Montezuma I''', was the fifth Aztec emperor and king of Tenochtitlan. He appears as a character in the ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' tie-in books as a ghost.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Jack Sparrow]]''===\nMontecuhzoma served as Cort\u00e9s' subordinate, believing him to be the god [[wikipedia:Quetzalcoatl|Quetzalcoatl]] in human form. His faith was such that Montecuhzoma remained loyal to Cort\u00e9s even when the conquistador began to dominate the Aztec empire and massacre its people. It was believed the Sword of Cort\u00e9s may have forced Montecuhzoma's loyalty. He was stoned to death by his own people for urging them to retreat rather than fight Cort\u00e9s' armies.\n\nHe was said to have died loyal to Cort\u00e9s, though it was known that his spirit, locked within the eye of Stone-Eyed Sam, held a grudge against his former leader. When [[Jack Sparrow|Captain Jack Sparrow]] released Montecuhzoma's spirit from the eye, Montecuhzoma challenged the spirit of Cort\u00e9s, forming two Swords of Light to battle Cort\u00e9s' Sword. Montecuhzoma disarmed his foe, and bodily carried Cort\u00e9s into the air, before plunging into the sea, defeating Cort\u00e9s.\n\nBefore departing, Montecuhzoma's spirit healed the dying Tumen, then flew off to the northwest.\n\n==Trivia==\n*[[Montezuma (Chihuahua)|Montezuma]] a.k.a. Monte from ''[[Beverly Hills Chihuahua]]'' was named after him and his role as leader of the Chihuahua tribe was based on him.\n\n{{PotCWiki}}\n{{Pirates of the Caribbean}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Emperors]]\n[[Category:Deceased]]\n[[Category:Pirates of the Caribbean characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Spirits]]\n[[Category:Historical characters]]\n[[Category:Characters based on real people]]"
