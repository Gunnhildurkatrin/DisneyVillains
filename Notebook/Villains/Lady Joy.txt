Hannelius. She is the daughter of [[Lord Gilbert]].\n\n==Role in the Series==\nIn her [[Sofia the Second (episode)|debut]], Joy came along with [[Lord Gilbert|her father]] to [[King Roland II|King Roland]]'s castle to discuss plans on rebuilding a bridge, and [[Sofia the First (character)|Sofia]] was to spend time with her. However, Sofia used a copying spell so she could go to the Highland Hootenanny, so Joy spent most of the day with her [[Sofia the Worst|copy]] who was a troublemaker that played tricks on everyone, to Joy's disapproval.\n\nBad Sofia soon gets bored with Joy and ditches her to go to the Hootenanny, which hurts Joy's feelings. Joy angrily storms up to the meeting room where her father is and states \"I want to talk to my daddy right now.\" but is told he's busy.\u00a0While waiting for her father, Cedric approaches her with an offer. The real Sofia, who has discovered her evil twin's true nature at the Hootenanny, arrives and apologizes to Joy. Soon, Bad Sofia appeares and starts causing trouble throughout the castle again. Cedric, the real Sofia, and Joy chase her into the conference room where everyone finds out about the two Sofias. After Bad Sofia reveals that Sofia made her, the real Sofia admits she did so, so she could be in two places at once. After Cedric got rid of the copy, the real Sofia apologized to Joy for her actions and took her to the Hootenanny where they became friends.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"180\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nSofia-the-Second-31.png|Joy with the Bad Sofia\nSofia-the-Second-39.png\nSofia-the-Second-46.png|Joy dancing with Sofia\n34.
