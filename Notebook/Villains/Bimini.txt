She is absent from the third film along with Delta.\n\nBimini's role is very small in the first film. Here she is only seen at the beginning, where she is at the dog groomer's with [[Chloe]] and Delta. She is then seen at the pool with them, and is later mentioned by Chloe as having a date with a dog named Scooter (who is said to chase parked cars and is 'crazier than a Labradoodle') She is seen again at the end with Delta and Sebastian, having been invited to a dance show.\n\nIn the sequel, her role is a bit larger. She attends Papi's wedding with Sebastian and Delta, and later watches the dog show on TV.\n\n{{Beverly Hills Chihuahua}}\n[[Category:Beverly Hills Chihuahua characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Pets]]"
