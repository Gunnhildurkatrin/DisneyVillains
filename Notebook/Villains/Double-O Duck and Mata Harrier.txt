"[[File:Double-O_Duck_and_Mata_Harrier.jpg|thumb|250px]]\n'''Double-O Duck''' and '''Mata Harrier''' are two anthropomorphic ducks who form a secret-agent duo. They were created by [[Dick Kinney]] and Al Hubbard in the same age when this creative duo of comic artists developed other important characters for Disney comics, such as [[Copete Duck|Fethry Duck]] and [[Hard Haid Moe]]. Double-O Duck's name is a play on \"007\" (a.k.a. \"James Bond\") while Mata Harrier's one is an obvious play on \"Mata Hari\". They appeared for the first time in the story \"[http://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=S+66086 The Case of the Purloined Pearls]\", where they fought against agents of the evil organization \"BLONK\". Then the agents of this organization became the traditional rivals of Double-O Duck and Mata Harrier in their subsequent stories. Most part of their comic stories were created by Brazilian cartoonists.\n\n{{Wikipedia|List of Donald Duck characters}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Spies]]\n[[Category:Detectives]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]"
