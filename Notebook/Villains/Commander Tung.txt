He is the mentor and teacher to Mulan who leads the Imperial Regiment.\n\n==Trivia==\n*He is one of the several brand-new characters created for the live-action film.\n*He once fought together with [[Fa Zhou|Hua Zhou]] in the past.\n*Even though he is based of Li Shang, he also has some similarities to General Li, by being the high ranking leader of the Imperial Army.\n*Both [[Chen Honghui]] and Commander Tung are loosely based on [[Li Shang]], [[Fa Mulan|Mulan]]'s love interest in the [[Mulan|original animated film]]. While the latter resembles Li Shang appearance-wise yet different in terms of personality, the former fulfills his character basis's position as Mulan's lover in the remake.\n**According to producer Jason Reed, the decision to omit Shang from the movie was partially inspired by the #MeToo movement, under the belief that having the commanding officer of an army serve as a \"sexual love interest\" was inappropriate. Instead, Shang\u2019s role was split into two new characters; one is Commander Tung, the General and a mentor figure to Mulan. The other is Honghui, one of Milan\u2019s army peers who eventually becomes her love interest. This decision was met with notable controversy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/lindamaleh/2020/02/28/disney-blames-metoo-for-li-shangs-absence-from-mulan-in-new-controversy/#37acd4a55965|title=Disney Blames #MeToo For Li Shang\u2019s Absence From \u2018Mulan\u2019 In New Controversy|website=Forbes|last=Maleh|first=Linda|date=February 28, 2020|accessdate=February 28, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nMulan (2020) - Commander Tung.jpeg\nMulan (2020) - Commander Tung 2.jpeg\nMulan (2020 film) (76).png\nMulan (2020 film) (95).png\nMulan (2020) - Photography - Commander Tung 2.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Mulan}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in remakes]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Mulan characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Military characters]]\n[[Category:Soldiers]]\n[[Category:Chinese characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Commanders]]\n[[Category:Martial Artists]]\n[[Category:Mentors]]\n[[Category:Generals]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]"
