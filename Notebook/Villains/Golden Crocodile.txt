[[Jake (Pirate)|Jake]]\u00a0plants the magic beans given to him by [[Peter Pan (character)|Peter Pan]] that grow into a massive beanstalk. Jake and his crew then climb the beanstalk, and find the golden crocodile with her golden eggs. When [[Captain Hook]] and his crew reach the top of the beanstalk, Hook was determined to steal the Golden Croc, but the golden crocodile proved to be too vicious and powerful for Hook and his crew to handle, as she chases the pirates across the island until she is lulled back to sleep by [[Sharky and Bones]]. With the mother crocodile sound asleep, Hook decides to steal the Golden Croc's eggs. Unfortunately for Hook, the Golden Croc wakes up, witnessing Hook plundering her eggs. The Golden Crocodile pursues Hook across Cloud Island to retrieve her eggs, only for both the crocodile and the captain to fall off the island. [[Izzy]] quickly used her [[Pixie Dust|pixie dust]] to rescue Hook and the Golden Crocodile. With the danger over, Hook tried one last attempt to flee with the golden eggs, but the eggs hatch into baby crocodiles.
