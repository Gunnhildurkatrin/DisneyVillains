Dawson]], in his narrative}}\n\n'''The Mouse Queen''' is the Queen of Mousedom and a character of Disney's [[1986]] animated feature film, ''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]''.\n\n==Role in the film==\nThe Queen is first seen in a photo of a newspaper article that is announcing her Diamond Jubilee.\u00a0[[Professor Ratigan|Ratigan]]\u00a0shows this photo to [[Thugs (The Great Mouse Detective)/Gallery|his henchmen]] while debriefing them on his scheme to seize control of Mousedom and presently burns it with his cigarette.\n\nShe makes a physical appearance near the end of the film, excitedly primping herself in preparation for her jubilee. When Ratigan's thugs, disguised as her guards, show up and present her with the [[Robot Queen|robot facsimile of herself]] that [[Mr. Flaversham]] built, the Queen is delighted to be receiving a gift but becomes confused when she sees the note attached to it says that her reign will come to an end.\u00a0\n\nWhen Ratigan enters the room, the Queen, still believing his disguised henchmen to be her actual guards orders them to seize him. However, their [[Professor Ratigan|boss]] gives them the same order and they seize her instead, prompting her to shout \"how dare you!\"\n\nWhile\u00a0[[Professor Ratigan|Ratigan]]'s coronation is taking place, she is carried off by [[Fidget]] in order to be fed to [[Felicia]], who is eagerly waiting outside one of the palace windows. She very nearly becomes the cat's dinner, but at the last minute, [[Basil]] runs up from behind and grabs her out of [[Fidget|Fidget's]] grasp. A little later, the Queen is seen tying [[Fidget]] up and trying to restrain Ratigan.\n\nShe makes her last appearance in a photo of another newspaper (kept by Basil) in which she honored Basil and\u00a0[[David Q. Dawson|Dawson]] in gratitude for saving her life and her kingdom.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Her name is sometimes given in the fandom as \"Mousetoria,\" a portmanteau of \"mouse\" and the real name \"Victoria.\" However, there exists no canon source for this name. She is simply called \"the Queen\" in dialogue and the voice credits only identify here as \"The Mouse Queen.\"\n\n{{The Great Mouse Detective}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Moustoria}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Queens]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Mice]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:The Great Mouse Detective characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]"
