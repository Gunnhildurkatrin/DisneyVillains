After learning of the [[Fountain of Youth]], King Ferdinand sends his most trusted agent, known only as the [[Spaniard (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Spaniard]], to find and destroy the Fountain, because as a devout Catholic, he saw it as an abomination in the eyes of God.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides]]''===\nDuring the night, two fishermen arrive at the palace of King Ferdinand, carrying a piece of cloth that contains an old man who claims to have traveled with the Spanish conquistador Ponce de Le\u00f3n. The man gives a logbook that belonged to Ponce de Le\u00f3n to Ferdinand. Ferdinand looks page by page finding nothing, but finally discovers an ancient symbol in one of the pages. Right then, he realized that the legends of the [[Fountain of Youth]] were true. King Ferdinand then sends the [[Spaniard (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Spaniard]] to find and destroy the Fountain.\n\nWhen [[Jack Sparrow]] is taken to the Palace of [[King George II]], the king learns that Ferdinand has devised a plan to seek the Fountain of Youth to gain eternal life just as he attempts to recruit Jack on a quest to find the Fountain which failed due to his escape, to which the king never realized that Ferdinand sent his men to find and destroy the Fountain, rather than gain immortality from it. However, Ferdinand's plan to destroy the Fountain was successful just as the Spaniard and his men to return to Spain to report their king that their assignment was completed.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nPirates4-disneyscreencaps.com-191.jpg\nFerdinandGiVentheLogbook.jpg\nKingFerdinadwithTheSpaniard-OST.png\nPirates4-disneyscreencaps.com-156.jpg\nFerdinandEnteringPromo.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Ferdinand VI of Spain and George II of Great Britain are the first historical monarchs to appear in the ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' film series.\n*In the fifth film \"''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales|Dead Men Tell No Tales]]''\" and merchandise inspired by it, the main antagonist [[Captain Salazar|Armando Salazar]] justifies his actions \"by rule of the King\".
