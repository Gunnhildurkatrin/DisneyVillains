She attempted to show Triton, Urchin, and Flounder Marlin's room, but it disappeared, causing them to think she just dreamed the experience, although the presence of Marlin's hat and book in the final panel strongly implies otherwise.\n\n==Trivia==\n*His name and position is an obvious reference to [[Merlin]].\n\n{{The Little Mermaid}}\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Little Mermaid characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Marine Animals]]"
