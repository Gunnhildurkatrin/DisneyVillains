He is a robot dog\u00a0invented by Bob to spend time with Bingo and Rolly while he is away at work and to help clean their messes. He often accompanies Bingo and Rolly on their adventures. In his debut episode, [[A.R.F.]], his main function was to clean up after Bingo and Rolly (strictly), but he has been upgraded frequently throughout the series.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nThough he is very smart, A.R.F. has a habit of talking about himself and others in third-person, rarely even using pronouns. A.R.F. is always prepared to help in any way he can, he even transforms into a motorbike just to carry the pugs around town. Possibly because he is a robot, A.R.F. never gets angry, as shown in \"[[Hissy's Big Day]]\" when he was trying to untangle Bob's garden hose and didn't get frustrated. Even though he doesn't get mad, A.R.F. does get sad, as shown in his debut episode when he knew the pugs had to clean up\u00a0''his''\u00a0mess because he wasn't able to.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nA.R.F. is a chrome blue robot dog with a dark blue nose. His shoulders have visible axles while his hind legs have visible knee joints. He has a large round snout and instead of eyes, he has a screen that displays two blue circles.\u00a0\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Puppy Dog Pals}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:A.R.F.}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:A.R.F.}}\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Puppy Dog Pals characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Machines]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]"
