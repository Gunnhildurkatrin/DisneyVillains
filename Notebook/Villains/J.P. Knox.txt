His widowed mother dropped him off at [[Maggie Nelson]]'s foster home. He doesn't like riding in cars as it returns his motion sickness which is because he used to live in one and slept in the front seat curled up like a cat.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Angels in the Outfield characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Deuteragonists]]\n[[Category:Kids]]"
