When in his puddle form, he is slippery and unaffected by people stepping on him. As a puddle, he is still mobile.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nHis wardrobe is made up of mostly red, orange, and yellow. He dons black rimmed glasses to help him see. His clothing choices are loose, sporty styles.\n\n===Personality===\nEthan is the intellect of the group. When under pressure, he stammers and tends to say positive comments, as seen during his Power Placement exam and after being subjected to a swirlie from Lash and Speed. He is sensitive to the term \"Sidekick\" and refers to it as \"Hero Support\".\nWhen with his friends, he's upbeat and enthusiastic.\n\n==Role in the film==\nEthan is called up after Zach for Power Placement. Coach Boomer places him in the \"Sidekick\" class after deeming his power to be lackluster for a \"Hero\" classification.\n\nIn the end, he gets hailed as a hero by tricking Lash and trapping his head in a toilet. He also uses his powers to cause Speed to slip while he is running, giving Warren the opportunity to pelt him with a fireball. He is last seen at Medulla's redone Homecoming Dance.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\">\nEthan from Skyhigh.jpg\nEthan's Puddle.jpg\n161783 full.jpg\n161770 full.jpg\nSky High 83.jpg\nWill and the gang in Epilogue.jpg|Ethan and his friends in the epilogue.\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n[https://skyhigh.wikia.com/wiki/Ethan Ethan at Sky High Wikia]\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Sky High}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Ethan}}\n[[Category:Sky High characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]"
