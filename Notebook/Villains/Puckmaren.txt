He is from the planet Binpuka Minor, which was destroyed by a comet, and the last surviving member of his kind.\n\n==Role in the film==\n[[Max (Flight of the Navigator)|Max]] had collected the Puckmaren as one of his samples prior to Binpuka Minor's destruction, but naturally could not return him there afterward.\n\nThe Puckmaren did not know his world was gone, and was angry that Max would not take him home; while Max could not bring himself to tell him he now had no home to return to.\n\nAt the end of the film, the Puckmaren is discovered to have stowed away in David's backpack after he arrives back in [[1978]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"180\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nPuckmarin.jpg\nTh6.jpg\nFlight_of_the_navigator_1986.jpg\nPuckmaren design concept.jpg|Design concept\nPuckmaren sculpt.jpg|Sculpted mold of Puckmaren\nPuckmaren puppet prototype.png\nPuppetmaker works on Puckmaren.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Flight of the Navigator}}\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Flight of the Navigator characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Time travelers]]"
