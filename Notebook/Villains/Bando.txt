Sassy first mistakes Riley and his gang for reinforcements for Ashcan and Pete, and Chance flees. [[Spike (Homeward Bound II)|Spike]] then lures Pete where Sassy is standing, who drops a flower pot on Pete's head, causing Bando to be impressed. After Ashcan and Pete fled in defeat, Riley and his gang introduce themselves to Shadow and Sassy and ask them who was the other dog that fled. Shadow says it was Chance, so Riley sends [[Delilah]] to find him. Bando asks Sledge where Delilah is going, and she replies that Delilah is going to find Chance. While looking for them, they notice the blood-red van, driven by Jack and Ralph, coming and hide, while Stokey and Bando hide in the alley.\u00a0After Jack and Ralph are gone, Shadow asks Riley where the Golden Gate Bridge\u00a0is. Riley replies that he knows where it is, but he refuses to help Shadow and Sassy due to there being too many humans.\n\nBando was later seen witnessing Shadow and Sassy rescuing a boy named Tucker and his pet cat Tiger from the family's house that had been set on fire by a careless Jack and Ralph.\u00a0Riley was impressed at them for saving Tucker and his pet cat and decides to help them. When they return to their home at the warehouse by the docks, they find Delilah and Chance already there resting. Bando gets into a fight with Chance, but Riley intervenes. Bando then secretly calls Chance a homewrecker for stealing his girlfriend Delilah.\n\nSometime later, Bando was outside with the others watching Chance playing with a trash bag. However, Jack and Ralph in the blood-red van suddenly arrive, and they all rush back inside except for Chance, who is still busy eating out of the trash bag. Witnessing Chance commenting that Ralph has the burger while otherwise oblivious to the fact that they were trying to bait him with the burger, Bando comments to his friends \"And they call ''me'' stupid\". Chance gets captured by Jack and Ralph and puts them in the blood-red van. Riley and his gang finally rush out to Chance's aid, but they are too late due to them being on the highest floor where they hide as the blood-red van drives away, but Riley decides to outrun them. After blocking them, Bando proceeds to attack Jack and Ralph after learning they had apparently injured Delilah by running over her paw during their scuffle, viewing that as a personal affront. Riley and [[Sledge]] deal with Jack and Ralph while Sassy frees Chance and the other captive dogs, who then chase Jack and Ralph away. Bando then sets the blood-red van in reverse and it falls into the river. Bando later went to look for Chance after he ran off, but he and the others were unable to find him.\n\nBando was last seen watching Riley return back after he leads Shadow and Sassy (Chance left earlier after Delilah reluctantly dumped him) to the Golden Gate Bridge, and he presumably allowed Delilah to leave his gang to be with Chance. Bando was not seen afterward, as he likely went back to Riley and his gang and still remains there.\n\n{{Homeward Bound}}\n[[Category:Homeward Bound characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]"
