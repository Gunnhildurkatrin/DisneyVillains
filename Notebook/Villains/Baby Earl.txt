He appears in the episode \"[[To Kilimanjaro Bird]]\". He is babysat by [[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]] after the two steal his grub.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nAlthough he never speaks, Baby Earl has the defined personality of an ambitious and mischievous flyer-in-training. Desperate to fly, he is na\u00efvely brave, willing to jump off a cliff face in the hopes of finding his wings. He gives his babysitters quite the trouble, being unwilling to compromise and even more than willing to take his own actions.\n\nHe is very much a mama's boy, acting especially innocent and sweet around his mother. His learning, however, comes of his accord, as he appears to be more productive when left to his own independence. Slow to learn, it often takes an extra push for Earl to discover the right way to progress.\n\nHis nature is fairly well-mannered, at least around his mother, though he doesn't seem to show much obedience when under the supervision of strangers. He can be very impulsive to the point of stupidity, though this is most likely due to his young age and inexperience with life outside the nest.\n\n===Physical Description===\nBaby Earl is a small, almost undersized eaglet with a skinny body and a giant head. Perhaps because of his young age, his body has not quite filled out yet, with his head and talons being disproportionately large in size, while his beak and lower body still have room to grow. His eyelids and feathers are dusky brown in color, while his head and neck are grayish-white. Like most eagles, his beak and talons are dark orange, and his eyes are bright blue.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Timon & Pumbaa]]''===\n====Backstory====\nBaby Earl is an eaglet who lived with his [[Mother Eagle|mother]] in the mountains.\n\n====\"[[To Kilimanjaro Bird]]\"====\n[[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]] stumble upon Baby Earl's feeding dish while visiting the mountains where he lives. Tempted by the tasty bugs in his dish, the two gobble up the remains of the food, leaving Earl's mother in a fury. In order to keep her from turning them in to the authorities, Timon and Pumbaa volunteer to be Earl's babysitters.\n\nAt first, Timon attempts a rushed treatment of Earl, but Pumbaa insists they stay in order to keep the eaglet safe. No sooner has he said this when Earl jumps out of his nest and nearly dies before being saved by a panicked Timon. Convinced that he must stay with Earl, Timon takes on the burden of babysitting. He attempts to use reverse psychology to get Earl to stay in his nest, but the plan fails, and Earl falls down the side of the mountain.\n\nWith free roam of the mountain, Earl hops from cliff to cliff, with Timon and Pumbaa scrambling to keep him safe. When he finally reaches his nest, he hops out, and Timon and Pumbaa are left to watch him fall. Unlike the other plunges, however, this one ends with Earl using safety pins from his nappy to take him back up the cliff and into his mother's waiting arms.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nBabyearlmother.png|Earl stands beside his mother\nYellingearlmom.png|Earl watches his mother yell\nEarlandmom.png|Earl is bid goodbye by his mother\nEarlcards.png|Earl \"plays\" cards with Timon\nEarlstory.png|Earl is \"read\" a story by Timon\nEarlsleep.png|Earl is \"rocked\" to bed by Timon\nEarlhang.png|Earl is saved by Timon\nEarllecture.png|Earl listens to Timon and Pumbaa argue\nKilimanjaro Bird (226).png\nHappyearlmom.png|Earl is praised by his mother for flying\n</gallery>\n\n{{TheLionKingWiki}}\n{{The Lion King}}\n[[Category:Timon & Pumbaa characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Eagles]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Infants]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
