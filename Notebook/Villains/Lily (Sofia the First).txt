She has long golden hair, green eyes and freckles on her cheeks. As a good witch, she wears a cream colored dress with flower patterns on the skirt, tied with a golden bow around her waist. She wears a dark amber witch hat and shoes.\n\n==Role in the Series==\nLily first appears in the episode, \"[[Cauldronation Day]]\" when she and Lucinda's other witch friends arrive at her Cauldronation. Lily wants to be Lucinda's witch of honor and constantly fights with Lucinda's bad witch friend [[Indigo]] for the honor.\n\nWhen their bickering makes Lucinda make her Raven Catcher crooked, Lucinda decides to pick Princess Sofia, who is also attending the Cauldronation, her witch of honor. When Indigo protests this decision on the grounds that Sofia isn't a witch, Lily, for once, agrees with her, but Lucinda's mother tells her it is not against any rules. Sofia sheepishly tells her she did not expect her to choose her, but Lily is angry at Sofia for \"stealing her best friend.\" However, when Indigo tries to get rid of Sofia by hexing the Raven Catcher Lily tries to stop her with a spell that makes the Raven Catcher go out of control. The Raven Catcher crashes into the potion and spills it all over the ground where it turns everyone except Lucinda and Sofia into owls which makes Lucinda run off. This makes Lily have another fight with Indigo prompting Sofia to walk up and tell them that their constant quibbling is the reason why everything's ruined and is not how best friends act. This makes a repentant Lily tell Sofia how to undo the spell which she then does.\n\nAfter Sofia brings Lucinda back, Lily apologizes to her and helps her and Sofia complete the ceremony. Afterward, she tells Sofia, whose spellcasting abilities impressed her, that she would make a great witch if she ever got tired of being a Princess.\n\nLily's second appearnce is in \"[[Too Cute to Spook]]\". She is dressed up as a cat to go trick-or-treating with Lucinda, Indigo, and Sofia. When she sees that Sofia brought Calista to join them, she is hesitant to allow her to stay, seeing as how Halloween is a very important holiday for witches. Still, she agrees to let the little girl go along with them. Throughout the night Calista causes problems for the older kids. She did agree to give her one more chance. When the Haunted Hayride ends in disaster the group find themselves trapped by the Giggling Goblin. She, Lucinda, and Indigo try to get out using a spell, but lose their wands in the process.\n\nLuckily, Calista comes up with a clever idea and tricks Giggling Goblin into eating some sour lemon candies which makes him unable to giggle then frees the group and returns their wands and brooms to them. They ask the Giggling Goblin to join them. Thanks to him and his magic, all the girls get more than enough candy to replace what they lost. Lily and the other witches agree that it has been a great Halloween. They agree to be friends with Calista and let her and the Giggling Goblin trick-or-treat with them next Halloween.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\">\nHi, Lucy-Lucy-0.JPG\nLily3-0.JPG\nLanding-0.JPG\nLily hugging Lucinda-0.JPG\nLily 03.JPG\nThanks, Lily-0.JPG\nLily-Lucinda.JPG\nLily-Indigo-0.JPG\nCauldronation-Day-10.png\nThe Broomstick Dance.JPG\nCauldronation-Day-24.png\nCauldronation-Day-17.png\nLily 05.JPG\nIndigo-Lily 02.JPG\nIndigo and Lily as owls.png|Lily as an owl\nLily-Indigo3.JPG\nCauldronation-Day-21.png\nToo Cute to Spook 1.png\nToo Cute to Spook 2.png\nToo Cute to Spook 24.png\nToo-Cute-to-Spook-6.png\nToo Cute to Spook 25.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Sofia the First}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Lily}}\n[[pt-br:Lily (Princesinha Sofia)]]\n[[Category:Witches]]\n[[Category:Sofia the First characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Owls]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
