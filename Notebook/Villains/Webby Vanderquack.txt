It is unknown what happened to Webby's own parents, but Mrs. Beakley seems to be her legal guardian. At the time of Mrs. Beakley's interview for the position of [[Scrooge McDuck|Scrooge]]'s maid, cook, and [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|the nephews]]' nanny, Webby, and Bentina were homeless. She agreed to work only for food and shelter for the both of them--a deal Scrooge couldn't refuse. Since then, both have been adopted into the Duck's extended family, and Webby earned a place in Scrooge's heart, evident by him telling her to call him \"Uncle Scrooge\" even though they're not related.\n\n===Personality===\nWebby is an extremely affectionate, adorable, and emotional little duckling and has a great love for animals. She's never without her \"Quacky-Patch\" doll--a small stitched doll that looks exactly like her and sometimes keeps small tokens like jellybeans and marbles inside a hole in its stitching. Webby's love for animals is her greatest asset since she seems to be able to tame even the most exotic creatures including dinosaurs and a [[Snow Monster]]. Her only conflict with animals came when she got lost in the Outback--her doll was stolen by a koala and she was chased by warthogs, though she eventually overcame her fear and became friends with those animals as well.\n\nWebby is very expressive and always speaks her mind. An example of this is that in a possible future, depicted in the episode \"[[Duck to the Future]]\", Webby is the only one of Scrooge's family to help him return to his own time. She has grown up into a lady and is married to [[Doofus Drake]]. When Scrooge returns to his own time, he suggests that he will see them at their wedding, to which Webby displays great disgust.\n\nThe Disney studio promotional material said that her greatest goal is to become the fourth \"Nephew\". Webby often feels neglected and this has often been the impetus for her own misadventures. One even caused her to join the Beagle Babes after being kidnapped by them. Despite incidents like the prior, Webby is also often the voice of reason and is shown to be much more sensible about certain things than the boys. One example of this is in the episode \"[[Merit-Time Adventure]]\", where the children are trying to earn their sailing merit patches, but she is the only one who studies for it while the boys goof-off. In the end, her studying pays off and she not only gets her patch, but she saves the day as well.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[DuckTales]]''===\nWebby makes her first appearance in the ''DuckTales'' episode \"Three Ducks of the Condor\" (part three of the pilot movie \"[[Treasure of the Golden Suns]]\"). After which she made regular appearances throughout the series. Some episodes even focused on her, such as \"[[Attack of the Fifty-Foot Webby]]\" and \"[[The Good Muddahs]]\".\n\nIn \"[[Attack of the Fifty-Foot Webby]]\", when Scrooge takes the children to the jungle to find a rare animal, Webby comes in contact with some water that causes her to grow to a massive size.\n\nIn \"[[The Good Muddahs]]\", Webby is kidnapped and held for ransom by the Beagle Boys' cousins, the Beagle Babes. During the time that they're holding her, she befriends them.\n\n====''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp|DuckTales the Movie]]''====\n[[File:1280px-Ducktales-disneyscreencaps.com-1474.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Webby in ''DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp''.]]\nIn the ''DuckTales'' movie, Scrooge takes Webby, the boys, and Launchpad on a trip to find the Treasure of Collie Baba, unaware that the evil [[Merlock]] is also looking for it. When they find it, she spots an oil lamp and asks Scrooge if she can have it, because it looks like a teapot. Not being very valuable, he says 'yes'. After having the treasure stolen by Merlock and barely escaping, they return to [[Duckburg]] empty-handed.\n\nOnce home, Webby begins to polish her \"teapot\". As soon as she wipes it with a cloth, a Genie pops out. He befriends Webby, [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]] and grants several wishes for them. Her first wish, for a baby elephant, almost reveals the Genie's presence. Finally, Webby's wish that her toys would come to life reveals his presence to Scrooge. Once [[Gene the Genie]] is revealed, Scrooge wishes for the Treasure of Collie Baba and takes the lamp to the Archaeological Society Ball, where he plans to tell of his discovery. Here, [[Dijon]] (Merlock's sidekick) gets a hold of the lamp and wishes for Scrooge's fortune. After he's arrested for trespassing on \"his\" own property, Webby and the rest of Scrooge's friends chip in to bail him out of jail. After which she assists in retrieving the lamp and saving the day.\n\n===''[[Raw Toonage]]''===\nWebby appears in the opening theme of ''Raw Toonage'' but does not appear in any of the episodes.\n\n===[[DuckTales (2017 series)|''DuckTales'' (2017)]]===\n[[File:DT2017 - Webby Vanderquack.png|left|200px]]\nWebby reappears in the reboot series as a major character. This incarnation of Webby is considerably older than the original, and is portrayed as an enthusiastic adventure fan and Clan McDuck historian who idolizes [[Scrooge McDuck]] and regards [[Donald Duck]] as \"one of the most daring adventurers of all time\".<ref>[http://suspendersofdisbelief.tumblr.com/post/157954747086/can-i-say-how-much-i-love-that-donald-is-an#notes DuckTales producer on Webby's new role]</ref>\n\nHowever, she is also extremely socially awkward. Having lived a sheltered life in McDuck Manor, Webby is new to the prospect of friends and the world outside. The nephews become her first real friends and later become who she considers family, while she helps them fill the holes in the McDucks' mysterious history; the first season's major story arc involves her helping [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|Dewey]] uncover what happened to the nephews' mother [[Della Duck]]. The reboot version of Webby is notably more extreme and competent since her protective ex-spy grandmother Beakley has taught her several unique skills, including foreign language and martial arts. Webby can be seen carrying her notable grappling hook, her adventure journal, and night-vision goggles. She is known as \"The Fists\" of the group.\n\nShe refers to Scrooge as \"Mr. McDuck\" until \"[[From the Confidential Casefiles of Agent 22!]]\", when Scrooge asks her to call him \"Uncle Scrooge\".\n\nIn \"[[The Last Adventure!]]\", Webby is revealed to actually be Scrooge's daughter via cloning and her original F.O.W.L. given name is [[April, May, and June|April]]. The episode does not imply that Webby will start using the name of April.\n\nWebby's original design appears in \"[[The Other Bin of Scrooge McDuck!]]\", when she is transformed into a doll of it during Lena's nightmare sequence. This doll can also been seen throughout the reboot pinned on Webby's bedroom wall.\n\n=== Other appearances ===\nWebby can be seen during the opening credits of ''[[Black Widow (film)|Black Widow]]'', as footage from the original ''DuckTales''<nowiki/>' opening appears in a series of screens.\n\n==Video games==\n===''DuckTales'' game series===\nIn ''[[DuckTales (video game)|DuckTales]]'' and its sequels ''[[DuckTales 2]]'' and ''[[DuckTales Remastered]]'', Webby is a non-playable character who appears at certain levels to drop hints to the player about winning. In the remastered version, her role was expanded.\n\n===''[[DuckTales: The Quest for Gold]]''===\nIn ''DuckTales: The Quest for Gold'', Webby is a playable character who is featured in the Wildlife Reservation level where the player must get photos of rare animals.\n\n===''[[Kingdom Hearts Union \u03c7]]''===\nWebby appears as a Medal in ''Kingdom Hearts Union \u03c7'', sporting her design from the ''DuckTales'' reboot.\n\n==Printed material==\n===Comics===\nWebby appeared regularly in the ''DuckTales'' comic book stories. She also appeared in the ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'' crossover arc ''[[Dangerous Currency]]'', during which she showed a slight crush on [[Honker Muddlefoot]].\n\n==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==\nDuring the ''[[Disney Afternoon]]'' era, Webby was a walk-around character at the Disney Parks. She was mostly seen in skits starring the ''[[DuckTales]]'' characters and at [[Disneyland]]'s temporary ''Disney Afternoon Avenue'' area. They have since retired her.\n\nDespite this, she does appear on the exterior of the Hong Kong Disneyland bus with Mickey and his friends and will host the water balloon game alongside Huey, Dewey, and Louie in the upcoming [[PLAY! Pavilion]] at Epcot. In the same park, she and her fellow ''DuckTales'' stars will host the [[DuckTales World Showcase Adventure]]. As well, she makes picture cameos in Minnie's Style Studio (in the model sheet for Cute Vanderquack), Camp Woodchuck Kitchen, and Villa Donaldo.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Webby was created primarily to serve as a condensed version of [[April, May, and June]], as it was believed that one set of triplets in the main cast was enough.\n*Although Webby was originally officially [[Bentina Beakley]]'s granddaughter and not related to the Duck/McDuck family (this later changed as revealed in the 2017 reboot finale), some ''DuckTales'' books mistakenly say she's Mrs. Beakley's niece and others say she's [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]]'s cousin. According to a French version of the Duck family tree (published prior to [[Don Rosa]]'s version's creation), she was [[Daisy Duck]]'s niece and presumably a cousin of April, May, and June.\n*Webby's surname is only mentioned twice in the 1987 series: once in \"[[Pearl of Wisdom]]\", when her name is announced in the marble shooting contest; and once in a television commercial, where she introduces herself to the audience. In the 2017 reboot, her surname is mentioned more frequently and as early as the pilot episode, \"[[Woo-oo!]]\". She also briefly mentions her surname in a Disney Channel commercial in which she watches ''[[Andi Mack]]'' and declares Mack her \"new best rhyme friend\", since their surnames rhyme;\n**The surname is unmistakably Dutch, insinuating Webby's family is from The Netherlands;\n**It's likely the name is supposed to be spelled \"Van Der Kwak\".\n*As Webby has a different surname from her grandmother, it can be assumed that Mrs. Beakley is her maternal grandmother while she got her surname from her father.\n**In the reboot, Webby is a clone of [[Scrooge McDuck]] that Mrs. Beakley found in a [[F.O.W.L.]] lab, and Mrs. Beakley's son-in-law and daughter, Mr. and Mrs. Vanderquack, died before Webby was born. It is implied she only has the Vanderquack name just to keep her true origins a secret.\n*Webby has rarely appeared outside the ''DuckTales'' franchise.\n*In the Dutch version of ''[[DuckTales]]'', Webby is named Lizzy, which was also the case for April, one of [[April, May, and June|Daisy's nieces]]. In the reboot series, the Dutch version changed her name to Webby, presumably to avoid confusion between the two characters. Ironically, Webby would be later revealed to ''be'' \"April\" in the series finale.\n*While not directly stated in the 2017 reboot, promos from DisneyXD confirm that her full name is, in fact, '''April McDuck'''.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O0WT1H7tw April McDuck {{!}} DuckTales {{!}} Disney XD]</ref>\n*The 1987 version of the character can very briefly be seen in the history montage near the beginning of the 2021 MCU film ''Black Widow''.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Inducks character|Webby}}\n\n{{DuckTales}}\n{{Mickey Mouse & Friends}}\n{{Disney Crossy Road}}\n{{DisneyTsumTsum}}\n{{Disney Emoji Blitz}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vanderquack, Webby}}\n\n[[ar:\u0631\u0648\u0628\u064a \u0628\u0646\u062f\u0631\u0628\u0637]]\n[[es:Rosie Vanderquack]]\n[[de:Nicky Vanderquack]]\n[[fi:Tepa]]\n[[it:Gaia]]\n[[pl:Tasia Van Der Kwak]]\n[[pt-br:Patr\u00edcia Vanderpato]]\n[[ru:\u041f\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0430 \u0412\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0435\u0440\u043a\u0440\u044f\u043a]]\n[[sv:Anki]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:DuckTales characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Scouts]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Darkwing Duck characters]]\n[[Category:Nieces]]\n[[Category:Orphans]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Raw Toonage Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Time travelers]]\n[[Category:Disney Crossy Road characters]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Horsemen]]\n[[Category:Wrestlers]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Emoji Blitz]]\n[[Category:Martial Artists]]\n[[Category:Disney All-Star Racers characters]]"
