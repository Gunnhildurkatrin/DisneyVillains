She made her first appearance in the ''[[DuckTales]]'' comic ''Dime After Dime''. She is notable among the characters created for the original ''DuckTales'' in that, despite only appearing in a single comic based on the show (and not in any episodes of the show itself), she would become a regularly recurring character in Magica-centric comic stories published in [[Italy]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\n0491 07.jpg\nMinima De Spell.jpg|Minima had the Number One Dime\nIMG 3077.JPG|Minima and her family in ''The Great Rock of Power-Plus!''\n</gallery>\n\n\n==See also==\n*[[Lena Sabrewing]]\n\n{{DuckTales}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:De Spell, Minima}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:DuckTales characters]]\n[[Category:Witches]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Nieces]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Italian characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]"
