Fife accommodates Forte's rules, only to one day have his own music solo, which Forte had promised him. Throughout the movie, he appears more of a nuisance to the main characters as well as an idiot and a troublemaker. He also is shown to \"fawn\" over Belle from time to time. Despite his mischievous antics, Fife has a warm-hearted personality and ends up rooting for Belle and the Beast at the end, giving the Beast\u00a0information on how to defeat Forte,\u00a0and eventually, lives his dream of having a music solo.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas]] ''===\nFife is a resident of the castle. When the Enchantress curses the Beast, he is transformed into a piccolo. He is tricked by [[Forte]] into trying to sabotage the relationship under the promise of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's ''Piano Concerto No. 15 in B-flat''. Fife lures Belle into Forte's room for him to tell Belle where a suitable Christmas tree is located. However, shortly after she leaves, Forte tells Fife to follow her \"to make sure they don't come back\". After accidentally causing the frozen lake's ice surface\u00a0to break, risking to drown Belle and Chip,\u00a0Fife regrets this action and decides to help Belle and Beast mend their relationship. Forte decides to destroy the castle, and Fife tries to stop Forte. Forte reveals that he never intended to give him Mozart's concerto (via expelling blank note sheets). No longer loyal to Forte, Fife tells the Beast that Forte's power comes from the keyboard, and Beast uses this knowledge to kill Forte. In the ending of the movie (taking place in the present), Fife takes over Forte's job as the court composer of the castle and finally gets to perform a solo, as he's always wanted.\n\n==Trivia==\n*It could be indicated that Fife had a secret crush on Belle since he acted very shy to her.\n*The word \"fife\" is another word for \"flute.\"\n*Paul Reubens did all the flute sound effects.\n*There is a man resembling him performing with a small orchestra at the wedding of Belle and the Prince in an illustration for the Disney Princesses book Royal Weddings.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n{{Beauty and the Beast}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Beauty and the Beast characters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Magical Objects]]\n[[Category:Servants]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:French characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Instruments]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Anti-villains]]"
