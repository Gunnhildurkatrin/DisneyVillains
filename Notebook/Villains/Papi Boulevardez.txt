He wears purple clothes and has styled green hair (however, when Suga Mama rescues him from slavery at an Okra Plantation and gives him black hair dye, he implies his hair color was originally black) just like the Joker from the ''Batman'' series, and he laughs manically like him after saying something rude in Spanish about Suga Mama. However, in episode \"[[Suga Mama's Believers]]\", Papi finally spoke English for the first time. It would seem that he\u00a0actually can\u00a0speak English (and understands it fluently), but prefers his native language. A genetic trait passed down in his family is that they all\u00a0have large feet (except maybe not his daughter-in-law) that enable them to swim better than most people. Whether or not the characters can understand him varies depending on the episode.\u00a0\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Papi's look and laugh are based on Cesar Romero and strongly resembles one of his characters, [[w:c:dc:Joker|The Joker]] from the Adam West ''Batman'' show.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Boulevardez, Papi}}\n{{The Proud Family}}\n[[Category:The Proud Family characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Grandparents]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters with disabilities]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]"
