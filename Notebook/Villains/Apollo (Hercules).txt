He wears a red tunic with a sun in the center and a red Roman-style helmet with a yellow plume that carries white strips.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nApollo has the standard powers of Olympian God, such as immortality, omnipresence, superhuman strength, metamorphosis, and teleportation. As the god of the Sun, he has the ability to control the sun via his Solar Chariot.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Hercules (film)|Hercules]]''===\nIn the film, Apollo has a very minor role in which he only appears in minor cameos.\n\nAt the beginning of the film, he is present for the party celebrating the arrival of [[Zeus (Hercules)|Zeus]] and [[Hera]]'s newborn child [[Hercules (character)|Hercules]]. Apollo, along with the other gods, is sent to find Hercules, but it is too late, as the baby had already been turned into a mortal, and was adopted by a mortal family. Eighteen years later, he is seen imprisoned with the other gods after they lost against [[Hades]] and the [[Titans]]. He and the other gods are soon freed by Hercules.\n\n===''[[Hercules (TV series)|Hercules: The Series]]''===\nApollo makes his first appearance in \"[[Hercules and the Apollo Mission]]\". In this episode, Hercules wants a better job for Career Day, so Zeus puts Hercules in charge of Apollo's Sun Chariot, which pulls the Sun through the sky, and promises to take responsibility should anything happen. However, the chariot is stolen by [[Pain and Panic]], and Apollo, believing that Hercules lost it, begins to question Zeus' leadership. Eventually, when the gods put a no-confidence vote between Zeus and Hades, Apollo was about to make the tiebreaking vote, only for the Sun to return to the Olympus with Hercules in tow. Subsequently, Pain and Panic accidentally reveal Hades was responsible for the Sun's theft, resulting in Zeus expelling Hades from Olympus with a lightning bolt.\n\nIn \"[[Hercules and the Pool Party]]\",\u00a0Apollo is one of the gods that\u00a0Hades invites to a pool party\u00a0in an enchanted pool to makes them forget who they are. Also, Hercules easily\u00a0wrangles Apollo's empty chariot, which had been going without its driver.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Apollo is the only Olympian god whose name is the same in both Greek and Roman mythologies. However, his Roman self is occasionally associated with the name Phoebus.\n*Although Apollo was the twin brother of [[Artemis]] in Greek mythology, the Disney versions of the characters are never seen interacting with one another. It is unknown if the two are related in these incarnations.\n*Apollo is depicted as the driving source of the Sun's orbit within the Hercules story. However, on multiple occasions, particularly concerning Hercules' friend [[Icarus]] (whom Apollo apparently mentioned to [[Zeus (Hercules)|Zeus]]), the Sun is depicted as an independent celestial body.\n*Another solar deity, [[Ra]], exists within the Disney Hercules mythos.\n*Apollo's voice actor, Keith David, would go on to play Apollo in the live-action series ''Hercules: The Legendary Journeys''.\n\n==Gallery==\n===''Hercules''===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nHercules-br-disneyscreencaps.com-8648.jpg\nHercules-br-disneyscreencaps.com-8616.jpg\nHercules-br-disneyscreencaps 234.png\nHercules-br-disneyscreencaps.com-1513.jpg\nHercules-br-disneyscreencaps.com-8599.jpg\nHercules-br-disneyscreencaps.com-8614.jpg\nApollo 0001.jpg\nHercules-br-disneyscreencaps.com-8618.jpg\nHercules-br-disneyscreencaps.com-9185.jpg\nHercules-br-disneyscreencaps.com-9224.jpg\nHercules-br-disneyscreencaps.com-9234.jpg\nHercules-br-disneyscreencaps.com-509.jpg\nHercules-br-disneyscreencaps.com-677.jpg\nHercules-br-disneyscreencaps.com-545.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===''Hercules: The Series''===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nApollo disney 3.jpg\nApollo disney 4.jpg\nApollo disney 7.jpg\nHercules and the Prometheus Affair (48).png\nHercules and the Prometheus Affair (56).jpg\nHercules and the Prometheus Affair (58).jpg\nHercules and the Tiff on Olympus (1).jpg\nHercules and the Tiff on Olympus (50).jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Miscellaneous==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\n400px-Apollo KHIII.png|Apollo in [[Kingdom Hearts III]]\n</gallery>\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Apollo}}\n\n{{Hercules}}\n{{Kingdom Hearts}}\n[[Category:Gods]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Immortal]]\n[[Category:Hercules characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Greek Mythology]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Greek characters]]\n[[Category:Olympian Gods]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]"
