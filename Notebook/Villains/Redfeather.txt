He was ultimately replaced by [[Meeko]].\n\nAt [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]], Redfeather makes an appearance with Meeko and [[Flit]] in the ''Drawn to Animation'' presentation at [[The Magic of Disney Animation]] to help demonstrate the process of character creation. When the host mentions the decision to bring in Meeko and that the turkey \"became an entree\", he gets transformed into a turkey dinner and Meeko starts chasing him.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nRedfeather 1.PNG|Redfeather interacting with a talking [[Percy]] in a pencil test.\nRedfeather 2.PNG\nRedfeather 3.PNG\nRedfeather 4.PNG\nRedfeather 5.PNG\nRedfeather 6.PNG\nDTA.PNG|Redfeather as he appears in \"Drawn To Animation\"\nRed Feather.jpg\nRedfeather Art.jpg\nRedfeatherConcept.png\nRedfeatherPocahontas (1).png\nRedfeatherPocahontas (2).png\nPocahontas and Co. with Redfeather.jpg|Redfeather with [[Pocahontas (character)|Pocahontas]] and [[Grandmother Willow]]\n</gallery>\n\n== Trivia ==\n\n* Had Redfeather been kept in the film, he would have been the second character in a Disney animated feature voiced by [[John Candy]]. He had previously voiced [[Wilbur (The Rescuers)|Wilbur]] in ''[[The Rescuers Down Under]]'', which, like ''Pocahontas'', was co-directed by [[Mike Gabriel]].\n{{Pocahontas}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pocahontas characters]]\n[[Category:Deleted characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Turkeys]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]"
