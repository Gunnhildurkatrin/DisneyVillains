She has green eyes and her outfit includes a blue, short-sleeved shirt, and pink jeans.\n\n==History==\nEmily's only appearance is in\u00a0<ref>Ingrid Third, Public Enemy Number One</ref>, in which she appears towards the end. When\u00a0Wayne Liggett\u00a0is in his new school's safety patrol headquarters reading a letter sent to him by Fillmore, she asks what he's reading. He tells her it's a letter (which she says she can see, apparently) and then asks who's it from. He replies that it's from his old safety patrol partner. After Wayne arrived at his new middle school and joined its safety patrol, Emily became his replacement, better half of the duo of safety patrol partners.\n\nBut their partnership wouldn't last long. In\u00a0<ref>South of Friendship, North of Honor</ref>, she is absent but mentioned. When Fillmore comes to visit Wayne at Macluhan, he learns that Wayne and Emily are no longer a team. It seems that she and Wayne had a falling out and she transferred to another school, following an incident in which Wayne got involved in some shady activities. He didn't fess up nor own up to what he did, so he let her take the fall and suffer the consequences for it.\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nIngrid Third, Public Enemy (17).jpg\n</gallery>\n==References==\n<references/>\n{{Fillmore!}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kinzey, Emily}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Fillmore characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Detectives]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]"
