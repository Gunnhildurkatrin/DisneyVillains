He is [[Skippy (Robin Hood)|Skippy]]'s, [[Sis]]'s, and [[Tagalong]]'s friend.\n\n==Personality==\nToby is a fairly minor character.

Toby is usually seen wearing black spectacles and a brown boat-like hat.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Robin Hood (film)|Robin Hood]]''===\nIn the movie, Toby is a turtle and a friend of Skippy, Sis, and Tagalong. He accompanies them to shoot Skippy's new bow and arrow. He is later seen at the archery tournament, where his father is apparently a competitor. Like the rest of the town, he is imprisoned for failure to pay taxes, but escapes after Robin Hood starts a jailbreak. At the end of the film, he is at the wedding of [[Robin Hood (character) |Robin Hood]] and [[Maid Marian]]. He notices Skippy joining the couple on their carriage, and asks why Skippy is going with them.\n\n===''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]''===\nToby is seen playing in the streets with Skippy while Ebenezer Scrooge (portrayed by [[Scrooge McDuck]]) has been reformed by three Christmas ghosts.\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\nToby is seen as a guest.\n\n==Trivia==\n*His name is possibly based on the character [[Toby Tortoise]] from the [[1935]] Silly Symphony cartoon ''[[The Tortoise and the Hare]]'' and the [[1936]] Silly Symphony cartoon ''[[Toby Tortoise Returns]]''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nSkippy and Toby.jpg|Toby and Skippy playing in ''Mickey's Christmas Carol''\nCliptr.gif|Toby\nHouseofmouse14.jpg|Toby and Skippy playing in \"Mickey Mouse Works\"\nToby hiding in his shell.jpg|Toby hiding inside his shell, in front of Maid Marian.\nFev152.gif|Toby (right) with Skippy's big Sister, Sis (left)\nTumblr n0npgtXJxQ1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\nRobin-hood-1080p-disneyscreencaps.com-2972.jpg|Sis, Tagalong, and Toby laughing at Skippy, being kissed by Maid Marian.\nToby.gif\nDVG Toby.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Robin Hood}}\n\n[[es:Toby Tortuga (Robin Hood)]]\n[[fr:Toby (Robin des Bois)]]\n[[Category:Turtles]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Robin Hood characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:English characters]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse Works characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey's Christmas Carol characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]"
