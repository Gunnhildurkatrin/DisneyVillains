He is the castle's head chef who was transformed into a stove by the [[Enchantress]]' curse.\n\n==Background==\nBeing the main chef of the castle, he delights in preparing various foods. As such, he gets upset when his talents go to waste, as evidenced by his complaint shortly before [[Belle]] arrives in the kitchen about how his meal had gone to waste due to the [[Beast]] cancelling dinner.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]''===\nChef Bouche first appears when he expresses disappointment that he had to throw away what he had cooked after the Beast cancels dinner. Though when [[Belle]] leaves her room and enters the kitchen, she admits she is a little hungry, Bouche eagerly starts preparing the fire to cook a meal on [[Mrs. Potts]]' order. Later, when the villagers attack the castle, he and the knives end up scaring away the villagers that had chased [[Sultan (Beauty and the Beast)|Sultan]] into the kitchen.\n\nHis fate is unknown after that, but it can be assumed that he was turned back into his human form offscreen.\n\n===''[[Beauty and the Beast: Belle's Magical World|Belle's Magical World]]''===\nChef Bouche makes a brief appearance in the story segment \"Mrs. Potts' Party\", where he is tasked by Belle to bake a cake for Mrs. Potts. However, he runs into difficulty as the cake ended up being made into a mess, although he ultimately succeeds in his task.\n===[[Beauty and the Beast (2017 film)|''Beauty and the Beast'' (2017)]]===\nChef Bouche, named '''Cuisinier''', appeared in the [[2017]] live-action remake, both voiced and portrayed by Clive Rowe. In addition to being changed into a stove, he also consists of various pots, pans, and other kitchen utensils as facial features and body parts.\n\nIn a deleted scene, he also had a run-in with [[The Bimbettes|the Village Lasses]], where he proceeded to spray prepared food at them, and then mockingly show the pot to their faces telling them that they \"look amazing\" and that they've \"never looked better\" while threatening them in a similar manner to Bouche to the other villagers in the original film. After the battle against Gaston stops, Cuisinier and all the other castle residents are transformed into inanimate objects.\n\nWhen [[Enchantress|Agathe]] uses her magic to restore the Enchanted Rose, Cuisiner is transformed back into her human form, along with the other castle servants. In another deleted scene Cuisiner is shown hugging [[Coat Rack|Chapeau]] as [[Monsieur Toilette]] passes them. When Chapeau reacts to the hotness as a side effect of Cuisiner having been a stove, Cuisiner apologizes to the villager. The villager gives him a forgiveness gesture.\n\n==Printed media==\n===[[Beauty and the Beast (Marvel Comics)|Marvel Comics]]===\nChef Bouche had a few cameos in the comics, namely when preparing a meal or when Cogsworth is doing his rounds in the castle.\n\n===''Disney Princess Royal Weddings''===\nWhat may be his human form appeared at one point in the story, where a slightly obese man with a goatee and white hair in a chef's outfit was present early in the bookmaking preparations for the wedding.\n\n==[[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Disney Parks]]==\nA figure of Chef Bouche appears in the loading area of [[Enchanted Tale of Beauty and the Beast|''Enchanted Tale of Beauty and the Beast'']] at [[Tokyo Disneyland]], themed as the castle kitchen with guests climbing aboard giant enchanted dishes.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nbeauty-disneyscreencaps.com-3927.jpg|Chef Bouche and [[Mrs. Potts]]\nbeauty-disneyscreencaps.com-3933.jpg|\"A culinary masterpiece gone to waste!\"\nbeauty-disneyscreencaps.com-3957.jpg|Chef Bouche notices [[Belle]] entering the kitchen\nbeauty-disneyscreencaps.com-8576.jpg|Chef Bouche scaring off the [[Villagers (Beauty and the Beast)|Angry Villagers]]\nbelle-disneyscreencaps.com-5551.jpg|Belle asks Chef Bouche if can whip up a cake for Mrs. Potts\nbelle-disneyscreencaps.com-5993.jpg|\"Get back to work\"\nbelle-disneyscreencaps.com-7083.jpg|\"Help someone, the cake something has gone terrible wrong\"\nbelle-disneyscreencaps.com-7154.jpg\nbelle-disneyscreencaps.com-7201.jpg\nbelle-disneyscreencaps.com-7453.jpg|Chef Bouche along with Belle and his kitchen staff present Mrs. Potts her cake\nBelle-magical-world-disneyscreencaps.com-6257.jpg\nBelle-magical-world-disneyscreencaps.com-6247.jpg\nChef Bouche Tokyo Disneyland.jpg|Chef Bouche in [[Enchanted Tale of Beauty and the Beast]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*His name, Bouche, is French for \"mouth, facial feature above the chin and below the nose; bottled, blocked, corked; dense, dim-witted, stupid; obstruct, cork; plug, block; stuff, bung; stop, choke, stop up\", several of which refer to a various element of culinary techniques. In addition, \"Boucher\" is also French for \"butcher\", which is a type of cooking profession for chopping up various meats and preparing them for sale.\n*When he scares the villagers away, he laughs, but his mouth does not move.\n==External Links==\n{{Beauty and the Beast}}\n[[Category:Beauty and the Beast characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Chefs]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:French characters]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Articles needing improvement]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Magical Objects]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Servants]]"
