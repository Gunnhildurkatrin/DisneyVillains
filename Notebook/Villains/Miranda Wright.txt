She replaces [[Lucky Piquel]] as [[Bonkers D. Bobcat|Bonkers]]' partner, when he leaves to become an FBI agent.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nMiranda is a kind and moral person. She is much more tolerable of Toon mannerisms than Lucky. While having to personally limit Bonkers' sporadic behavior at times, it doesn't seem to annoy her. She even seems amused at times. Her relationship with Bonkers would later serve as the basis for the relationship between [[Elisa (Gargoyles)|Elisa]] and [[Goliath]]\u00a0from\u00a0''[[Gargoyles]]''.\n===Physical Appearance===\nMiranda is a beautiful and slender woman with blonde hair with some tied at the back, brown eyes, fair skin, pink lips. As a police officer, she wears a blue police uniform that consists of a blue shirt and indigo pants, black police necktie, utility belt, and shoes, both gold badge and name and when she's off duty, she wears a pink sweater, blue jeans and white sneakers.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Bonkers]]''===\nMiranda serves as [[Bonkers D. Bobcat|Bonkers]]' partner after Lucky leaves to become an FBI agent. However, rather than being Bonkers' polar opposite (like Lucky), she limits the flamboyant nature of Bonkers and other Toons without being annoyed by it.\n\nMiranda also appeared in the Lucky episode \"[[Hear No Bonkers, See No Bonkers]]\" as a secretary to the Chief.\n\n==Trivia==\n* Her name is a pun on \"[[Wikipedia:Miranda warning|Miranda rights]]\"; which means the  right to remain silent when questioned by the police as well as having legal representation in the United States to criminal suspects in police custody, which perfectly fits her tolerated and moral personality.\n* She closely resembles [[Calla]] from ''[[Adventures of the Gummi Bears|The Gummi Bears]]''.\n* She shares her full name and blonde hair with [[w:c:scoobydoo:Miranda_Wright|another]] (one-time) character from the ''[[w:c:scoobydoo:Main_Page|Scooby-Doo]]'' franchise, although with some notable differences: Miranda from ''Bonkers'' is older, taller and kind-hearted, while Miranda from ''Scooby-Doo'' is younger, shorter and a self-centered arrogant brat.\n*She last appeared in \u201cCartoon Cornered\u201d, in which they made a Problem Child animated series which was on USA around the same time.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"175\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nBonkers74.jpg\nHear No Bonkers, See No Bonkers - Miranda.png\nvlcsnap-2016-04-15-15h01m20s631.png\nMiranda Wright.jpg|Miranda as she dresses off-duty\nCowgirl Miranda 1.jpg|Miranda as Two-Gun in the episode \"[[Fistful of Anvils]]\"\nMiranda Wright Driving.jpg\nCowgirl Miranda 2.jpg\nMiranda.jpg\nCowgirl Miranda 3.jpg\nCowgirl Miranda 4.jpg\nBonkers Do Toons Dream of Animated Sheep Screenshot 2.JPG\nCowgirl Miranda 5.jpg\nVlcsnap-2015-12-14-11h16m39s761.png\nBonkersWithMiranda.jpg\nDog Day Aftertoon - Goofy Cameo.png\nDog Day Aftertoon - Goofy Cameo 2.png\n4 police.jpg|Miranda with Bonkers, the chief and Sgt Grating.\n</gallery>\n\n{{Bonkers}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wright, Miranda}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Bonkers characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Police officers]]\n[[Category:Aunts]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Cowboys & cowgirls]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Martial Artists]]"
