"[[File:Parker Mackenzie.jpg|thumb|250px]]''All info was provided [[w:c:lizziemcguire:Parker Mackenzie|Parker Mackenzie at Lizzie McGuire Wiki]]''\n\n'''Parker Mackenzie''' was a girl in Lizzie's class. She was portrayed by Chelsea J. Wilson.\n\n==Appearances==\nIn one episode, Gordo had a crush on her. She was a vegetarian, as shown in the episode \"Obsession\", and even called Lizzie a \"meat-eater\". In an episode, Gordo asked Parker for a dance. She refused, because, in her opinion, he is too short for her. Parker disliked Lizzie because she sneezed on her Macaroni Art in the 2nd grade, and sat on her Titanic lunch box in the 5th grade.\n\n===Dear Lizzie letter===\nIn the episode Dear Lizzie, she asks Lizzie for advice (signing her email as \"I Want To Be An Only Child\") on dealing with her little sister Maddy (who she sees as annoying). Here is the email she typed:\n\n\"Dear Lizzie,\n\nMy little sister is incredibly annoying. She goes through all my stuff, she listens in on my phone calls and is a total pain. But my parents think she's totally adorable. What do I do?\n\nSigned, I Want To Be An Only Child\"\n\n===Lizzie's response===\nDear Only Child,\n\nLittle sisters are always annoying, and you'll never get your parents to believe you. Get a lock for your room and look for an out-of-state college.\n\nGood luck, Lizzie.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mackenzie, Parker}}\n{{Lizzie McGuire}}\n[[Category:Lizzie McGuire characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
