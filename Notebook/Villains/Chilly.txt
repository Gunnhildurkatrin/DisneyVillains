He always gets check-ups because he thinks he catches silly ailments, starts to melt or breaks a bone.</span>\n\n==Appearance==\nChilly is a plump stuffed snowman with black eyes, a short carrot nose, a black hat, a blue striped scarf, and two black buttons down his front. He usually wears a blue wooly hat, a green coat, and red mittens when he goes out in the snow.\n==Personality==\nWhile sweet and lovable, Chilly is rather silly due to the fact that he is always worrying about something. Chilly often worries about melting like real snowmen do, or being sick or injured in nearly any way, shape, or form. Chilly can also be quite cowardly at times and usually has very little self-confidence as seen in \"Nurse' Office\" where he was too afraid to take part in\u00a0[[Professor\u00a0Hootsburgh|Professor&nbsp;Hootsburgh]]'s\u00a0toy school, but is still willing to help and even face his fears to help his friends. Chilly is also generous, as seen in \"Selfless Snowman\" where he donates some of his stuffing to [[Pickles]].\n\n==Role in the Series==\nChilly is a stuffed snowman who worries a lot and is not always sure that he is not a real snowman. Doc thinks Chilly is very sweet and cares for him deeply. Whenever Chilly worries about melting or anything else he fears might be wrong with him, Doc reassures him that he will be fine.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Chilly is a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypochondriasis hypochondriac], meaning he is constantly worried about his health.\n*Chilly and Stuffy are good friends and get along most of the time.\n*Chilly may have a little\u00a0crush on Hallie.\n*Chilly collects snow globes.\n*Chilly wants to be a weatherman.\n\n{{Doc McStuffins}}\n[[Category:Toys]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Doc McStuffins characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Snowmen]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
