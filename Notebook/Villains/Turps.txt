"[[File:Epic_mickey_turp.jpg|thumb|240px|Turps flying near Mickey at [[Lonesome Manor]].]]'''Turps''' are green primal Guardians in ''[[Epic Mickey]]'' appear whenever [[Mickey Mouse]] uses [[Thinner]]. They are attracted to Mickey when he gets near them and float around him as they await his command. The Turps can show Mickey which direction he needs to go and can also damage [[Blotlings]] and [[Beetleworx]] on contact. Minor enemies, like Spatters or Hoppers, can be thinned out completely. But stronger enemies, like Slobbers or Tankers, require more Turps.\n\nThe Turps resembles green balls with a dark green trail made of Thinner for a tail. They will always show you the bad way. You can attract Turps by using Thinner and making bad choices. These guardians exist to help you using the bad way. If you want the Turps to show you where to go next, hold the Wii-mote upright. They will charge themselves and then leave a glowing trail around the area where you should go next. When you want the Turps to harm enemies, shake the Nunchuk up and down to send a single Turp to damage the enemy. If you want all your guardians to damage the enemies, flick the Wii remote and the Nunchuk up and down.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Tints]]\n**[[Thinner]]\n{{Epic Mickey}}\n[[Category:Epic Mickey characters]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]"
