'''Experiment 102''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba_Jookiba|Jumba Jookiba]]\u00a0and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]]. He is designed to\u00a0cause traffic jams. His one true place is as a traffic light in [[Kokaua Town]].\n\n==Background==\n===Physical appearance===\nStopgo is a yellow experiment with a long, narrow neck like a traffic pole, and a traffic light-shaped head with a green and red light (most likely his eyes, oriented vertically) on each side of his head.\n\n===Special Abilities===\nStopgo can cause traffic jams by posing as a false traffic light and lighting his eyes up to imitate real street lights\n\n==Appearances==\nExperiment 102 was the 102nd genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to cause traffic jams by posing as a traffic light. 102 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch| Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.\n\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\n102's pod was one of the\u00a0twelve experiment pods recovered by [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Stitch]] in \"[[Drowsy (episode)|Drowsy]]\". His was one of the final four experiment pods (among [[Nosox|204]], 274 and [[Drowsy|360]]) that [[Pleakley]], with some assistance from Stitch, cataloged after being convinced to do so by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]].\n\nAt an unknown point, 102 was activated, captured, tamed, and named Stopgo, and found a one true place as a traffic light.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nStopgo was seen when [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] was making her rounds with [[Scrump]] to check on all of the experiments, and she noticed Stopgo doing his job\u00a0as she was crossing the street.\n\nLater, the first 624 experiments, including Stopgo, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium\u00a0to be destroyed. However, Lilo, [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]] and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nStopgo participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]], but it is unknown what he did.\n\nThe Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Stopgo is Experiment 102. However, in \"[[Drowsy (episode)|Drowsy]]\", his\u00a0[[Experiment Pods|pod]] is labeled 239, most likely due to\u00a0Jumba's untidy [[Jumba's Computer|database]].\n*Stopgo did not appear activated until ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nvlcsnap-2012-07-03-21h03m27s105.png\nvlcsnap-2013-03-02-10h00m22s26.png\n0ac8a565.png\nVlcsnap-2012-07-03-21h03m39s202.png\nVlcsnap-2013-05-21-12h35m12s6.png\nVlcsnap-2013-02-08-11h58m00s88.png\nvlcsnap-2012-08-02-19h15m27s51.png\nVlcsnap-2013-03-30-19h50m30s116.png\nVlcsnap-2013-07-07-22h58m23s166.png\nVlcsnap-2012-08-02-20h56m43s41.png\nVlcsnap-2013-02-08-11h59m38s131.png\nVlcsnap-2013-05-21-14h09m47s96.png\nVlcsnap-2013-07-22-18h56m29s196.png\nVlcsnap-2012-08-02-19h04m08s119.png\nVlcsnap-2013-04-03-21h41m26s43.png\nVlcsnap-2013-07-22-19h02m58s54.png\nVlcsnap-2013-06-13-14h04m04s77.png\nvlcsnap-2013-03-14-09h37m58s79.png\nVlcsnap-2013-03-14-09h38m47s233.png\nScreenCapture 03.04.13 14-16-57.jpg\nVlcsnap-2012-07-03-22h16m18s43.png\n102 - Stopgo.png\nStopgo-1-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
