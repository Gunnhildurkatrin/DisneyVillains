He tells his son to be safe when doing the mail route by avoiding [[Aconcagua]].\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Saludos Amigos]]''===\nPapa Plane appears in the segment, ''[[Pedro]]'', where he and his wife are introduced by the narrator. He is then seen when he has a cold, to which he couldn't get the mail, followed by his wife whose oil pressure is high as neither both of Pedro's parents could do the mail route, so [[Pedro (character)|Pedro]] must do the job for them. Just as Pedro's mother teaches her son to be safe, her husband tells his son to avoid going near [[Aconcagua]]\n\nLater that night, Pedro's parents are worried that they couldn't find their son, which is later found out that Pedro survived a terrible storm in Aconcagua and the mail Pedro brought to them is a postcard, making his parents proud as Pedro feels satisfied of his first flight.\n\n{{Saludos Amigos/Three Caballeros}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Saludos Amigos characters]]\n[[Category:Vehicles]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]\n[[Category:Aircrafts]]\n[[Category:Transportation]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]"
