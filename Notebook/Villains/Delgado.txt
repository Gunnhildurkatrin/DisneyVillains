Unable to help his injured partner, Delgado got kicked out of the force. \n\nHe meets [[Chloe]]\u00a0after he rescues her from a dogfight with Diablo. She thanks Delgado for saving her and asks him if he could help her find her way back to Beverly Hills. Delgado refuses at first, but after Chloe insists that she was dognapped and being pursued by Diablo, the police dog reluctantly helps her by keeping her from being detected.\n\nAlong the way, Chloe constantly pesters Delgado by asking him agitating questions. Later, while Delgado was asking for help from one of his German Shepherd friends, Chloe gets tricked by a rat named [[Manuel]] and an iguana named [[Chico]], who talk her into giving them her diamond collar. When Delgado finds out, he quickly becomes furious with her because that collar was evidence to where she lived.\n\nLater, Chloe and Delgado become stranded in a desert after jumping off a train they stowed away on earlier. They eventually encounter a large group of stray Chihuahuas led by [[Montezuma (Chihuahua)|Montezuma]], who save them from three vicious mountain lions where Chloe and Delgado\u00a0then stay for a short time at the Chihuahua pack's birthplace.\n\nAfter some time, Chloe and Delgado arrive at a national park in [[Mexico]], where Chloe is recognized by an employee. Unfortunately, Chloe is found and taken away by El Diablo to [[Vasquez]] and his henchman, [[Rafferty]].\n\nSometime later, the same rat and iguana from before help Delgado by presenting him with Chloe's collar. Delgado sniffs it several times befre he gets his sense of smell back as he goes to find Chloe. He eventually finds Diablo and defeats him by pinning him to the ground, although Diablo manages to slip away. Shortly after, Delgado becomes a member of the police force again and bids Chloe farewell before he leaves with his new partner.\n\n===''[[Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2]]''===\nDelgado reappears in the second film where he participates in the dog fashion shown to win a large cash prize for [[Papi]] and [[Chloe]]'s family to save Sam and Rachel's family home, although he is the first one to be disqualified for unknown reasons. His main role is that he finds [[Alberto and Antonio]] (Degaldo's sons) that he had regretfully abandoned as puppies at a police station, due to an incident in the past. Later, after helping capture the bank robbers, Chloe and her family eventually explain to Delgado's sons why he\u00a0did it, and they accept this from them and their father, thus earning him a place in Beverly Hills in the [[Los Angeles|L.A.]] force for a while, and giving him and his sons more time to catch up a little.\n\n===''[[Beverly Hills Chihuahua 3: Viva la Fiesta|Beverly Hills Chihuahua 3]]''===\nDelgato has a small role in the third film. He shows up at the hotel garden that was vandalized by accident, listening to Papi about his plan to expose [[Jenny (Beverly Hills Chihuahua)|Jenny]] for her evil acts. After Papi and [[Pedro (pit bull)|Pedro]] make her trip and fall in a puddle of peanut butter, Delgado is seen dangling [[Mr. Montague]] from a tree. He then drags [[Oscar (Beverly Hills Chihuahua)|Oscar]] into a police car. He is later seen at [[Rosa]]'s quincea\u00f1era, celebrating with everyone else. \n\n== Etymology ==\n* The name '''Delgado''' means \"thin\" in Spanish. \n\n== Trivia ==\n*The dog that portrayed Delgado is named '''Sam'''.\n*It is unknown on what happened to Delgado's wife, although she could have possibly died after giving birth to [[Alberto and Antonio]].\n**It is also possible that she was killed by the bank robbers as Delgado had been told that his family would be targeted for revenge.  \n*If viewers look in a deleted scene of the first DVD movie, Delgado is seen eating crickets (much to [[Chloe]]'s disgust) and says \"Tastes like chicken\", the same line\u00a0[[Timon]]\u00a0said in\u00a0''[[The Lion King]]'' with a young [[Simba]] being disgusted at Timon eating a grub.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}{{Beverly Hills Chihuahua}}\n[[es:Delgado]]\n[[fi:Delgado]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Beverly Hills Chihuahua characters]]\n[[Category:Police officers]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Deuteragonists]]\n[[Category:Tritagonists]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"
