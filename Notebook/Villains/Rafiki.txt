He is a mandrill who serves as a shaman and Royal Mjuzi of the [[Pride Lands]]. Rafiki has an eccentricity that paints him as something of a lunatic; in truth, he is a sage with a deep connection to magical and spiritual elements.\n\nWith his [[Rafiki's Bakora Staff|bakora stick]] always on his person, Rafiki uses his wisdom to guide those in need, most notably [[Simba]].\n\n==Background==\nIt is revealed in the storybook ''[[A Tale of Two Brothers]]'' that Rafiki was not always a resident of the Pride Lands. Years before [[Mufasa]]'s reign, Rafiki was a traveler studying the African lands who eventually stumbled upon the Pride Lands, where he was attacked by a young [[Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed]]. The mandrill was saved by [[Ahadi]], the then-ruler of the Pride Lands and father of Mufasa and [[Scar]] (then known as Taka).\n\nEventually taking residence in the vast lands, Rafiki would soon become close companions with Mufasa and one day overheard Taka's plot to sabotage his brother's reputation, only to be foiled by the mandrill. The end results in Taka falling injured, with Rafiki using his abilities to tend to his wounds and heal him, though one mark remains on the lion's body - his scar, thus becoming the dangerously-envious Prince Scar.\n\nRafiki's heroic performance throughout the event leads to Ahadi requesting that the mandrill serves as the adviser to all future kings, which Rafiki accepts.\n\nBy the time of ''The Lion King'', Rafiki lives in an ancient baobab tree, where he regularly performs shamanistic activities. He continues his role as Royal Mjuzi of the Pride Lands and remains a close friend to Mufasa and his family.\n\n===Personality===\nRafiki is extremely sagacious and wise. However, his way of exploiting his intelligence is highly irregular; he prefers to teach his pupils (such as Simba) by bombarding them with cryptic metaphors, and typically in a way that purposely annoys them. He takes great joy in this, and though unconventional, the methods of his teaching have proven to be effective time and time again. It should be noted that part of the reason Rafiki's teachings are quite eccentric is the fact that Rafiki, himself, is fairly eccentric. He is excitable, energetic in spite of his age, and tends to fall into fits of hysterical laughter when something amuses him. He also tends to speak in third-person when speaking of himself.\n\nDespite this, much as his reputation would conceive, Rafiki does have a tamer side. He takes his role as a sage of the Pride Lands somberly and will act diligently to ensure the balance of the \"Circle of Life\" remains intact. Whenever the Circle of Life is broken, Rafiki would become very depressed about it, such as when Scar allowed the hyenas into the Pridelands, or when Simba banished Kovu, the only hope of redemption for the Outsiders, out of arrogance and paranoia. He is also deeply connected to the spiritual world, as he is seen communicating (both professionally and casually) with Mufasa's spirit in ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride''.\n\n===Physical Appearance===\nRafiki is shown as an aging, elderly, slender mandrill. He is shown to be greying, and broken (shown as he walks with his staff, using it as a cane). He is shown to have a bent tail, is half bald with a white beard, black pupils. His face is shown as pale blue with a bright red nose showing.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[The Lion King]]''===\n[[File:Lion-king-disneyscreencaps.com-279.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Rafiki in ''The Lion King'']]\nRafiki is shown as a wise shaman figure of the Pride Lands, having a close relationship with his dear friend King [[Mufasa]], where he is shown presenting his and Queen [[Sarabi]]'s son, [[Simba]] during the future king's presentation. After the presentation, at his [[Rafiki's Ancient Tree|Baobab Tree]], he is shown excitingly drawing a painting of Simba, pleasing him.\n\nLater on, when [[Scar]] tells the [[Pridelanders]] of the death of [[Mufasa]] and [[Simba]] (though unknown to Scar and Rafiki, [[Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed]] hadn't killed Simba as he fled), and Scar ascends the throne, letting [[The Hyena Clan]] enter the [[Pride Lands]], leading to disaster. Deeply saddened, at his tree, Rafiki wipes off his painting of young Simba, believing him dead.\n\nYears later, after picking up Simba's scent in the dust, pollen, and petals in the air, Rafiki realizes that Simba is still alive and joyfully restores the drawing, adding the full mane of an adult lion as a sign to seek him out and save the Pride Lands from Scar's tyranny. Journeying to the [[jungle]] where Simba lives with [[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]], Rafiki observes Simba and recognizes, at least in principle, that he is suffering from a ponderous emotional burden.\n\nTo treat it, he approaches the young lion and teaches him a few playful (and sometimes painful) lessons about learning from the past, not running from it. He also points out that the spirit and values of Simba's late father Mufasa continue to live in Simba himself. During this scene, Rafiki incessantly repeats the Swahili phrase \"''Asante Sana, squash banana, we we nugu, mi mi apana'',\" which roughly translates to \"Thank you very much, squash banana, you are a baboon, and I am not.\" When Simba decides to return to Pride Rock and fight Scar for the kingship, Rafiki accompanies him, also making sure to inform Nala, Timon, and Pumbaa about Simba's decision to return to Pride Rock and confront Scar. Despite his age, he displayed his masterful combat abilities as a warrior in battle, by bashing one hyena in the head hard with his staff to save Simba, before effortlessly dispatching more in kung-fu like fashion.\n\nAt the end of the film, he is then seen, where the Pride Lands, now reformed to its former glory has regrown and the [[Pride Lands]] having returned, he is seen presenting Simba and [[Nala]]'s [[Kiara|newborn cub]], reminiscing of the opening of the film.\n\n===''[[The Lion King II: Simba's Pride]]''===\n[[File:Thelionking2 571.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Rafiki in ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride''.]]\nRafiki returns for the sequel, with [[Robert Guillaume]] reprising his role. In this film, Rafiki is shown to be more intertwined in the politics of the Pride Lands, while remaining a shaman and wise figure, having the ability to speak with the spirit of [[Mufasa]].\n\nHe is first seen during the opening ''[[He Lives in You]]'' sequence, where he calls the Pride Animals to [[Pride Rock]] for the presentation of the newborn cub of Simba and Nala, [[Kiara]]. Much like the original film, he presents the cub, leading to cheers from the Animals. When [[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]] talked about the \"little guy\", an amused Rafiki reveals that it is a girl.\n\nYears later, while making a painting of Kiara, now as a young adult, the spirit of [[Mufasa]] tells Rafiki that Kiara and [[Kovu]], a lion raised by a loyal follower of [[Scar]], [[Zira]] (who believes Kovu should be king as he was chosen by Scar) should fall in love to break the feud, with Rafiki reluctantly agreeing, confused on the king's decision. He is also seen attending Kiara's first hunt's ceremony, seeming happily pleased, with Kiara hoping that Simba would trust her on going alone, which he does not, sending Timon and Pumbaa.\n\n{{Quote|Welcome to Upendi!|Rafiki to Kiara and Kovu}}\nAfter Kiara is saved by Kovu in a wildfire, and when Simba is reluctant to have Kovu join his pride, Rafiki tells Simba that Kovu saved Kiara's life, with Simba accepting Kovu, though with hostility. As Kiara and Kovu grow closer, Rafiki them leads them and teaches about \"Upendi\" (which is love in Swahili), leading them to love.\n\nLater on, when Kovu is exiled by Simba for being supposedly involved in an ambush on him by Zira and her pride the [[Outsiders]], Rafiki is shown to be deeply saddened by the King's arrogant decision.\n\nAfter the battle against Zira, where the Outsiders (sans Zira, who dies after an attempt to kill Simba failed) join the Pridelanders, Rafiki is present at the wedding of Kiara and Kovu, wedding them. As Mufasa speaks with Simba, Rafiki feels it, smiling on.\n\n===''[[The Lion King 1\u00bd]]''===\n[[File:lionking3-208.jpg|thumb|250px|Rafiki in ''The Lion King 1\u00bd''.]]\nRafiki appears as a supporting character in ''The Lion King 1\u00bd''. He is referred to by Timon simply as \"The Monkey\", his name only being shown in the credits of the film.\n\nHe is first seen briefly after Timon leaves his meerkat colony in search of a better life away from predators and free of tunnel digging. After explaining this to Rafiki, the mandrill openly realizes Timon seeks \"Hakuna Matata,\" meaning \"No worries,\" and thus introduces him to the problem-free philosophy. Rafiki then explains that, in order to find Hakuna Matata, one must look beyond what they see, setting Timon's journey in motion.\n\nLater on, Rafiki is seen speaking with [[Timon's Mother|Timon's Ma]] about his meeting with her son. Thinking Rafiki sent Timon out to find a life nonexistent, resulting in him finding danger instead, Ma scolds the mandrill and heads out to find Timon with [[Uncle Max]]. Years later, Rafiki is seen visiting Timon at the latter's jungle oasis, where he (somewhat) enlightens Timon on what it is to be a true friend and the true power of Hakuna Matata.\n\nDuring the film's finale, Rafiki is lastly seen attending the theater viewing of the film, alongside the other characters from the film, as well as a large amount of [[Disney characters]].\n\n===''[[Timon & Pumbaa]]''===\n[[File:Rafiki T&P Series.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Rafiki in ''The Lion King's Timon & Pumbaa''.]]\nRafiki is a secondary protagonist in the ''Timon & Pumbaa'' TV series, having his own segments titled \"Rafiki Fables\" during the show's first season. His shamanism is expanded throughout the show.\n\nIn \"[[Good Mousekeeping]]\", it is shown that Rafiki can grant wishes (or as he calls them, \"Rafiki Wishes\", with his policy being only one wish per animal) and can also take back wishes as well.\n\nIn \"[[Beauty and the Wildebeest]]\", Rafiki helps an ugly wildebeest named Herman impress a young gazelle.\n\nIn \"[[Rafiki's Apprentice]]\", Rafiki is shown to have a nephew named [[Nefu]] and his walking stick is shown to have magical powers. It is also revealed that Rafiki got his stick from his grandfather when he was young. He explains to his nephew that the gourds on his stick are the key to his mystical abilities.\n\nIn the Timon and Pumbaa-centric episodes, Rafiki acts as a therapist during times of stress within' their friendship.\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\n[[File:Rafiki and Scar.jpg|thumb|250px|Rafiki holding Scar in ''House of Mouse''.]]\nRafiki is a recurring guest in ''[[House of Mouse]]''. His most memorable scene was in \"[[The Stolen Cartoons]]\", where Timon yelled that there was a fly in Pumbaa's soup and that he wanted one as well. Timon then asks what is in Simba's soup and he replies that it is Rafiki, who is bathing in his soup.\n\nHe was given his own advertisement at the end of \"[[King Larry Swings In]]\", which promoted Rafiki's Royal Treatment\u2014a service in which Rafiki could be hired to partake in special events like birthdays, tea parties, holidays, and puppet shows.\n\nIn \"[[Jiminy Cricket (House of Mouse)|Jiminy Cricket]]\", the camera panned to Rafiki, sitting alongside [[King Triton]], [[Merlin]], and [[Grandmother Willow]], when [[Jiminy Cricket|Jiminy]] advised the audience to always respect their elders.\n\nIn \"[[Ask Von Drake]]\", Rafiki could be seen holding Scar during the [[The Ludwig Von Drake Song|headcount of all the Disney character guests]].\n\nIn \"[[Everybody Loves Mickey]]\", Timon laughs at [[Mortimer Mouse]]'s jab at Rafiki's age, to which the latter responds by knocking Timon on the head with his stick. [[The Evil Queen]] does the same when Timon laughs at Mortimer's comment that [[Snow White]] is the fairest of them all.\n\nRafiki also made several cameo appearances in ''[[Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse]]'' during crowd shots and the [[The Best Christmas of All|finale song]].\n\n===''[[The Lion Guard]]''===\n[[File:Rafiki TLG.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Rafiki in ''The Lion Guard''.]]\nRafiki returns in the animated series, first appearing in the pilot film ''[[The Lion Guard: Return of the Roar]]'' (which takes place during ''[[The Lion King II: Simba's Pride]]''). He, along with Simba and Nala, hears Kion's [[Roar of the Elders]] and feels that Kion is ready to become the leader of the new [[Lion Guard]]. Though Simba is against the idea, feeling Kion is not ready, Rafiki (along with Nala) is an avid supporter, believing it to be fate. The mandrill is able to quickly convince Simba to go along with informing his son of his destiny, and in order to do so, he and Rafiki take the young cub to a hidden area of Pride Rock, where paintings on the stone walls tell the story of the previous Lion Guard, which was led by Scar (who destroyed his guard after they refused to help him overthrow Mufasa). Rafiki is seen again during the climax, where Simba, Nala, and Rafiki are able to witness a Kion-led Lion Guard successfully defending the land from a [[Janja's Clan|hyena]] invasion. With this, Kion has proven himself to be worthy of the responsibility, though Rafiki is unsurprised.\n\nIn \"[[Bunga the Wise (episode)|Bunga the Wise]]\", Bunga misinterprets a compliment from Rafiki and declares himself \"Sage of Hakuna Matata Falls\". He then takes it upon himself to solve all problems within the Pride Lands, but to bizarre results. In the end, Rafiki explains he did not finish his statement and clarifies that honey badgers are smart ''when they think things through''.\n\nIn \"[[Paintings and Predictions]]\", Bunga feels Rafiki's murals can predict the future. However, Rafiki later explains that his mural tells stories are of the past.\n\nIn \"[[Beware of the Zimwi]]\", Rafiki tells the Guard of a legendary creature known as the Zimwi. His stories spook the others, giving them anxiety throughout the rest of the episode.\n\nIn \"[[Lions of the Outlands]]\", Bunga recalls that Kion and his friend [[Jasiri]] traveled to the Outlands to meet with a group of lions; Rafiki correctly believed these lions to be Zira and her clan, and thus warned the rest of the Guard of their dangerous loyalty to Scar and that Kion could be trouble if they learn his identity as Simba's son.\n\nIn \"[[The Rise of Scar]]\", Rafiki gains an apprentice named [[Makini]]. When she was born, Makini was chosen by the Great Kings of the Past to act as Rafiki's successor once the latter passes away. Once she comes of age, Makini begins her training under Rafiki, who teaches his apprentice of the power that comes with being the mjuzi, such as hearing the Great Kings of the Past, who can also be summoned by Kion. Rafiki also informs her that \"bad\" lions can be summoned as well and to do this, one must be near fire and use both Kion's roar and a magical bakora staff. This information is overheard by [[Ushari]], who delivers this news to [[Janja]] and his hyena clan. Together, they take Makini's staff and trick Kion into using his roar in [[Janja's Den|the Outlands]], allowing them to summon Scar.\n\nIn \"[[Rafiki's New Neighbors]]\", Rafiki is helping Makini paint for the Royal Family until they get interrupted by noise from an elephant, a sable antelope, and a monkey. Chama, Furaha, and Mzhaha decide to move in, but Rafiki cannot handle the noise they make. He asks the guard if they could return the friends to their herds. Later, the friends come back because they realize they do not belong in their own herds. Rafiki suggests that they live somewhere else and the three friends leave. Later, fire hits the tree from dry lighting, and the two mandrills are trapped. The three friends come to the rescue and start to put out the fire. With the guard's help, Rafiki's tree is saved at last and Rafiki allows the friends to stay. Chama mentions that they found a home near Big Springs where they can be as loud as they want. Rafiki offers them to come to watch Makini paint. Later Makini paints a picture of the Royal Family.\n\nIn \"[[Divide and Conquer (The Lion Guard)|Divide and Conquer]]\", Scar orders the hyenas and jackals to get rid of Rafiki since he can sense the Great and Evil lions of the past. When hearing Janja, Rafiki joyfully fights of the hyenas with help from the Guard and [[Tamaa]].\n\nIn \"[[The Scorpion's Sting]]\", Rafiki manages to cure Simba of a deadly infection after the Lion Guard fends off the [[Army of Scar]] by getting the volcanic ash to cure the venom paralyzing Simba.\n\nIn \"[[The Wisdom of Kongwe]]\", Rafiki suggests Simba getting advice from the old tortoise [[Kongwe]] on how to defeat Scar.\n\nIn \"[[The Fall of Mizimu Grove]]\", Rafiki attends a ceremony for [[Makini]].\n\nIn \"[[Battle for the Pride Lands]]\", he shows a map between the Pride Lands and [[Tree of Life (The Lion Guard)|Tree of Life]], to help guide Kion and his team as, together with Makini, they depart for the Tree of Life so Kion can be given the medical attention for Ushari's venom and regain control of the Roar of the Elders.\n\nIn \"[[Journey of Memories]]\", Makini remembers the time she spent with her parents [[Fikiri]] and [[Kitendo]] who tell her that Rafiki was once a Royal Mjuzi and one day, Makini might be a Mjuzi like Rafiki as well. During the musical number \"[[As You Move Forward]]\", Makini's parents take their daughter to Rafiki in the Tree of Life where he is seen standing alongside [[Janna]] who is happy to see Makini visit the Tree.\n\nIn \"[[Return to the Pride Lands]]\", once Kion and his team return to the Pride Lands following Kion's recovery at the Tree of Life, he explains the events that happened while Kion and his team were away with help from some of his paintings and supported by Kovu and Kiara, who reveal events that occurred in ''Simba's Pride'' and why Kovu, [[Vitani]] and the Outsider lionesses are now part of Simba's pride. Later when Kion and Vitani clash against each other while Thurston tells them to do it his way, Ono tells Bunga that both Lion Guards should compete to know whose Guard is better to which the Battle of the Lion Guards begins. During the Battle of the Lion Guards, Rafiki talks to the [[Pride Animals]] about the Battle of the Lion Guards to know whose Lion Guard is better in a competition between Kion and Vitani while Ono gets to be the judge as his position as the Smartest. Eventually, Kion allows Vitani to win during the Battle of the Lion Guards. Once Kion masters the Power of the Roar and relinquishes his title as the leader of the Lion Guard, Rafiki then joins Simba, Nala, Kovu, Kiara, Timon, Pumbaa, and Kion's team as they attend the wedding of Kion and [[Rani (The Lion Guard)|Rani]] at the Tree of Life, marking Kion as the new King with Rani as his mate.\n\n===[[The Lion King (2019 film)|''The Lion King'' (2019)]]===\n[[File: Rafiki from Remake.png|thumb|left|250px|Rafiki in the 2019 remake]]\nRafiki appears in the [[2019]] remake as a supporting character, voiced by [[John Kani]]. This incarnation of Rafiki is depicted as notably less eccentric and playful than in the original version.\n\nRafiki arrives at Pride Rock during the birth of Simba where he presents Mufasa and Sarabi's newborn cub during the presentation. Later, Rafiki goes to his tree where several bugs help him complete a painting of Simba (instead of using gourd juice to complete the painting like in the original film). He later appears sitting next to Zazu in which both of them feel disappointed upon hearing Scar's plans on becoming the new king following Mufasa and supposedly Simba's deaths in a stampede.\n\nAfter Simba grows up as a young adult lion, Rafiki sees a part of his mane delivered by each animal that finds it as he discovers that Simba is alive. After Simba feels upset about his refusal to return to Pride Rock and not listening to Nala's advice, he encounters Rafiki, who reminds him that he is the son of Mufasa. Rafiki then tells Simba to look into the pool of reflection where he explains that Mufasa still lives in Simba's heart even though he died during the stampede. Simba then decides to return to Pride Rock, thanks to Rafiki's plan on helping him remember his father, who tells him to take his rightful place as the new king.\n\nAs Simba returns to Pride Rock, Rafiki sets out to find his staff and calls it an \"old friend\" to help Simba stop Scar from ruling the Pride Lands (this scene was not in the animated version, because in the original film, Rafiki tells Nala that Simba returned to Pride Rock to take place as King). During the final battle against Scar, Rafiki uses his staff to save Zazu from the hyenas, whereas in the animated version, he saves Simba instead of Zazu.\n\nAfter Scar's death, Rafiki and the other Pridelanders are proud of Simba who stopped Scar's tyranny. Rafiki then tells Simba that it is time to take place as the new king of Pride Rock. Later at the end of the film, Simba and Nala give birth to a new cub as Rafiki presents the new cub in front of the animals.\n\n===Other appearances===\nIn a parody trailer for the film ''[[Lilo & Stitch]]'', Rafiki is seen showcasing the iconic \"Circle of Life\" scene from the film, only to find that baby Simba has been replaced with [[Stitch]].\n\nIn the animated blooper reel featured in ''The Lion King: Diamond Edition'' special features, Rafiki is seen twice; first seen falling asleep during a scene with Simba, while another shows him accidentally tripping over something and dropping Simba off the ledge of Pride Rock, in the middle of \"[[Circle of Life]]\".\n\nIn ''[[Timon and Pumbaa's Wild About Safety]]'', Rafiki is seen in the form of a trophy in the episode ''Honest and Real!''.\n\n==Video games==\n===''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]''===\n[[File:Rafiki KHII.png|left|150px]]\nRafiki is first mentioned by Nala after being rescued by the valiant [[Sora]] and his friends, [[Donald Duck]] and [[Goofy]]. Sora's bravery leads Nala to believe he may have a chance at saving the Pride Lands from the tyrannical Scar and become the new king. She escorts them to Pride Rock where a brief meeting with Rafiki is held. Unfortunately, Rafiki denies Nala's expectations, claiming Sora lacks the right attributes needed to be the ruler of the land.\n\nHe isn't seen again until later on, after Sora, Nala, Donald, and Goofy make way for the jungle oasis to find Simba, who was believed to be dead until Sora revealed otherwise. Rafiki learns of Simba's fate (much like in the film) and celebrates it. Rafiki is last seen, during the first visit, inducting Simba into the throne.\n\nRafiki returns during the second visit where an army of Scar's ghost begins haunting the Pride Lands. Simba asks Rafiki for guidance, only to be told the ghosts thrive off of Simba's insecure heart, much to the king's dismay. In the end, after the ghosts are defeated, Rafiki is there to see Sora and friends off, bestowing a few wise words for their travels before they depart.\n\n===''[[Disney Heroes: Battle Mode]]''===\nRafiki appears in the game as one of the heroes of the lion king universe appearing in an update along with [[joy]], he despite not having a basic attack only waves his staff to heal allies and only attacks using his green ability, too. his white ability allows him to meditate to heal himself.\n\n===Other games===\nAlong with having a stationary role in the film's [[The Lion King (video game)|video game adaptation]], Rafiki also plays a rather major role in ''[[The Lion King 1\u00bd (video game)|The Lion King 1\u00bd]]'' and has an add-on costume in the ''[[Disney Universe]]'' game.\n\n==[[The Lion King (musical)|Musical]]==\n[[File:Rafiki TLK Broadway.jpg|thumb|250px|Rafiki in the musical adaptation of the film.]]\nIn the musical based on the film, the character of Rafiki went through a minor change. Because director Julie Taymor felt that the story lacked the presence of a strong female, Rafiki was changed into a female mandrill. The role was originated on Broadway by Tsidii Le Loka, who was nominated for a Tony Award in 1998 for her performance.\n\nRafiki's role is expanded in the musical. She sings the song [[Circle of Life]] and her painting scene is extended. She also sings a song called \"[[Rafiki Mourns]]\", in which she mourns Mufasa's death. She also has a brief role in [[Nala]]'s song \"[[Shadowland]]\", blessing Nala for her journey to find help. Instead of finding Simba's scent on dust, Rafiki hears Simba's song \"[[Endless Night]]\" on the wind. Rafiki meets Simba and shows him that his father lives on inside him through the song \"[[He Lives in You]]\" (it should be noted that Rafiki's \"Asante Sana\" chant is completely changed). She is present during the battle, fighting a hyena using hand-to-hand combat.\n\nLastly, she appears adorning Simba with the king's mantle and then presents his newborn cub at the end of the play.\n\n==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==\n[[File:Rafiki HKDL.jpg|thumb|250px|Rafiki posing for a photo at Hong Kong Disneyland.]]\nRafiki appears at the Disney theme parks around the world as a meet-and-greet character.\n\n===[[Walt Disney World]]===\nHe hosts the Rafiki's Planet Watch area of [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]], an area that hosts various conservation education programs and the park's veterinary facilities. One of the various shows inside the pavilion has Rafiki profiling different endangered species and telling guests how they can help them.\n\nIn [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] version of [[Fantasmic!]], he replaces [[King Louie]] in the jungle sequence.\n\nIn the former show [[The Legend of the Lion King]] at the [[Magic Kingdom]], Rafiki was a costumed character with an [[Disney Characters' Articulated Heads|articulated head]] as the narrator.\n\nIn [[Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom]], Rafiki notices a disturbance in the Circle of Life when he is informed that Scar has been revived from the dead by [[Hades]]. He also has a spell card called \"Rafiki's Wisdom Stick\".\n\n===[[Tokyo Disney Resort]]===\nIn the [[Tokyo DisneySea]] version of Fantasmic!, Rafiki arrives after the jungle mash and showcases the [[Circle of Life]].\n\n===[[Disneyland Paris]]===\nIn a portrayal heavily influenced by his Broadway incarnation, Rafiki appears in [[Mickey and the Magician]] at the [[Walt Disney Studios Park]], where he assists Mickey on a quest to become a magician.\n\n===[[Disney Cruise Line]]===\nRafiki can be seen in [[Believe (show)|Disney Believe]] aboard the [[Disney Dream]] cruise ship. Rafiki is one of the \"magic makers\" to help an uptight father believe in magic. Rafiki is seen right after [[Grandmother Willow]]'s sequence and uses the mystery of the animal kingdom to aid Sophia's father Dr. Greenaway's imagination. Like in the Broadway version of ''The Lion King'', Rafiki is portrayed by a woman.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*His name translates to Friend in Swahili.\n*In the earliest drafts of ''[[The Lion King]]'', Rafiki was not a mandrill, but a cheetah. Instead, [[Scar]] was a baboon.\n*No one in any of the films, other than himself, refers to Rafiki by his name. They either call him \"the monkey\" or \"the baboon\". His name is only used in ''[[Timon & Pumbaa]]'' and ''[[The Lion Guard]]''. Although, in an early draft of the first film in what would become \"The Circle of Life\" sequence, Mufasa refers to Rafiki by his name.\n*Rafiki's species, the mandrill, is one of the few species that aren't native to Sub-Saharan [[Africa]].\n**Rafiki is drawn with a pronounced tail, a contrast to the most diminished tails of real mandrills.\n**Mandrills are also no longer classified as baboons. They are more closely related to other primates, like mangabeys.\n*In ''[[The Lion King 1\u00bd]]'', he knows Timon and Pumbaa, ignoring the fact they didn't know who he was when first seeing him in the jungle with Nala.\n*The song Rafiki sings to himself, \"Asante sana, squash banana, we we nugu, mi mi apana,\" is Swahili for \"Thank you very much, squash banana, you are a baboon and I am not.\"\n*According to [[Robert Guillaume]], Rafiki's voice was partially created from a failed attempt at a Jamaican accent.<ref>[http://onemovieourviews.com/2011/09/21/interview-robert-guillaume-voice-of-rafiki-in-the-lion-king/Interview: Robert Guillaume \u2013 Voice of Rafiki in \u201cThe Lion King\u201d]</ref>\n**Notably, ''The Lion Guard'' marks the first time that [[Robert Guillaume]] doesn't reprise his role as Rafiki, due to retiring from acting in [[2014]].\n*In ''[[D3: The Mighty Ducks]]'', the giant stuffed baboon that a child wins at a carnival bears a striking resemblance to Rafiki.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{The Lion King}}\n{{House of Mouse}}\n{{Kingdom Hearts}}\n{{DisneyTsumTsum}}\n{{Disney Crossy Road}}\n{{Disney Emoji Blitz}}\n{{Disney Heroes: Battle Mode}}\n[[ar:\u0631\u0627\u0641\u064a\u0643\u064a]]\n[[es:Rafiki]]\n[[fr:Rafiki]]\n[[it:Rafiki]]\n[[nl:Rafiki]]\n[[pl:Rafiki]]\n[[pt:Rafiki]]\n[[pt-br:Rafiki]]\n[[ru:\u0420\u0430\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0438]]\n[[Category:The Lion King characters]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Fantasmic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney on Ice characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Monkeys]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom Characters]]\n[[Category:Spell Cards characters]]\n[[Category:African characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Universe Suits]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Mentors]]\n[[Category:Martial Artists]]\n[[Category:Timon & Pumbaa characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey's Soundsational Parade]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Schoolteachers]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Characters who narrate the story]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:The Lion Guard characters]]\n[[Category:Stitch and Friends Summer Surprise]]\n[[Category:Celebrate the Magic characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Crossy Road characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Magic Kingdoms characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Heroes: Battle Mode characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Sorcerer's Arena Characters]]"
