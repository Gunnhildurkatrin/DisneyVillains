When [[Zootopia (location)|Zootopia]] is plagued with the infliction of [[night howlers]], Manchas falls victim and becomes one of the city's \"''savaged''\" predatory citizens.\n==Background==\nManchas is an employee of the [[Tundratown]] Limo Service: a reportedly shady business owned and operated by the district's local crime boss, [[Mr. Big (Zootopia)|Mr. Big]]. Manchas, himself, has not shown any signs of nefarious intent in line with his superior, however.\n\n===Official Description===\n:\"''A highly regarded chauffeur who works for the biggest\u2014and shadiest\u2014limo company in town.''\"<ref>[http://deadline.com/2015/10/zootopia-cast-idris-elba-j-k-simmons-octavia-spencer-bonnie-hunt-tommy-chong-1201594498/ Deadline.com: \"Disney\u2019s \u2018Zootopia\u2019 Cages Idris Elba, J.K. Simmons, Octavia Spencer & Others\"]</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Zootopia]]''===\nOn a dark night, Manchas is escorting [[Mr. Otterton|Emmitt Otterton]] to [[Tundratown]] to speak with his boss, [[Mr. Big (Zootopia)|Mr. Big]]. During the drive, however, Manchas overhears a commotion in the backseat; before he can further investigate, Otterton suddenly attacks Manchas, forcing the car to come to a stop. It appears that Otterton had \"gone savage\", though Manchas manages to escape alive; his eye is brutally injured, however. He informs Mr. Big about the incident and returns to his home in deep fear.\n\n[[File:Savage Manchas.png|thumb|left|250px|Savage Manchas.]]\nTen days later, Manchas receives a visit from [[Judy Hopps]] of the [[Zootopia Police Department]], and [[Nick Wilde]], for questioning about Otterton's disappearance. Manchas explains the events of the horrific night, telling them that Otterton spoke of \"[[night howlers]]\" before he turned savage. Nick convinces Manchas to allow the former and Judy inside, to which Manchas agrees and unlocks the door. Before he can undergo further questioning, however, he suddenly loses his sanity and becomes savage himself, apparently falling victim to the same affliction that claimed Otterton. The now feral jaguar attacks Nick and Judy, and a chase through the [[Rainforest District]] ensues. Manchas eventually corners the pair on a ledge and nearly kills Nick, but is stopped by Judy, who chains the jaguar's leg to a post using handcuffs. The two escape to alert the police, but during their absence, Manchas mysteriously vanishes.\n\nIt is later discovered that he was captured and imprisoned at the [[Cliffside Asylum]] by elite wolf security forces, under the confidential orders of [[Mayor Lionheart]], who is looking for a cure to the savage outbreak, having secretly imprisoned fourteen other predators that have also gone savage, to prevent public panic. When [[Chief Bogo]] and the [[Zootopia Police Department|ZPD]] are informed by Judy and Nick, they raid the asylum and arrest Lionheart. Manchas and the other savage predators are then taken to hospitals.\n\nSometime later, Judy discovers the true cause of the predators' strange behavior is due to them being darted by a ram named [[Doug (Zootopia)|Doug]] with a drug made from the night howler flowers, as part of a plot masterminded by Assistant Mayor [[Bellwether]] to have all predators removed from Zootopia. After Bellwether and her accomplices are arrested, a night howler antidote is made, and Manchas is cured along with the rest of the afflicted predators.\n\n===Other appearances===\nAn emoticon version of Manchas appeared in the ''Zootopia'' entry of the ''[[As Told by Emoji]]'' short series. He is encountered and turned savage on a \"New Contact\" page, though he is defeated after Judy selects \"Block this Caller\".\n\n==Trivia==\n*Despite having done his own Spanish voice for [[LeFou]] in ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', Corti does not do his own Spanish voice for Mr. Manchas.\n*His name means \"spots\" in Spanish and Portuguese.\n*Manchas' chase with Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde is reminiscent of the [[Sabor]] chase scene in ''[[Tarzan (film)|Tarzan]]''.\n*He bears a striking resemblance to [[Bagheera]] from ''[[The Jungle Book]]''.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Promotional Images===\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nZootopia Poster.jpg\nNocturnal-Mammals-1.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nZootopia Trailer Panther Driver.png|Manchas hearing a conmotion in the backseat\nZootopia-disneyscreencaps com-6186.jpg|Machas attacked by the savage Emmitt Otterton\nZootopia-disneyscreencaps.com-10043.jpg\nZootopia-disneyscreencaps.com-10071.jpg|Mr. Manchas gets hit with the night howler serum\nZootopia-disneyscreencaps com-6279.jpg\nZootopia Manchas Savaged.png|Manchas goes savage\nZootopia-disneyscreencaps com-6299.jpg\nZootopia-disneyscreencaps com-6330.jpg\nZootopia-disneyscreencaps com-6422.jpg\nZootopi Trailer Manchas.png\nZootopia-disneyscreencaps com-6471.jpg|Manchas chained by Judy\nZootopia-disneyscreencaps com-6479.jpg\nZootopia-disneyscreencaps com-6511.jpg\nZootopia-disneyscreencaps com-7392.jpg\nZootopia Savage Manchas1.jpg|Savage Manchas imprisoned in Cliffside Asylum\n</gallery>\n\n===Printed media===\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nZootopia Book 08.jpg\nZootopia Book 11.jpg\nTumblr o3wsp1QYVj1teftymo7 1280.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Zootopia}}\n{{Disney Crossy Road}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Manchas, Mr.}}\n[[ar:\u0627\u0644\u0633\u064a\u062f \u0645\u0627\u0646\u0634\u0627\u0633]]\n[[de:Manchas]]\n[[es:Se\u00f1or Manchas]]\n[[pl:Renato Mia\u0142czuk]]\n[[pt-br:Sr. Manchas]]\n[[ru:\u041c\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440 \u041c\u0430\u043d\u0447\u0430\u0441]]\n[[Category:Zootopia characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Jaguars]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Crossy Road characters]]"
