"{{Infobox character\n|name = Rover\n|image = Carousel-of-Progress-Rover-at-Christmas.jpg\n|rides = [[Carousel of Progress]]\n|alignment = Good\n|alias = Queenie, Sport, and Spot (Ghost Gallery)}}\n'''Rover''' is the family dog in the [[Magic Kingdom]] attraction [[Carousel of Progress]].\n\n==Appearances==\n===Carousel of Progress===\nIn each scene throughout each decade, Rover would lie on the floor near his owner, [[John (Carousel of Progress)|John]]. In the final scene, he is sitting and wearing a Christmas bow. \n\n===The Ghost Gallery===\nIn the 1990s, [[Walt Disney World]] [[cast member]]s created an unofficial but influential backstory for [[The Haunted Mansion (attraction)|The Haunted Mansion]]. In this story, Rover would be revealed to have been from a litter of five puppies with the each of the different scenes' dogs in Carousel of Progress being a different dog with their names being: Rover, '''Queenie, Sport, and Spot''' who lived in the attraction.\n\nThese dogs were the sibling of Bony, the [[Caretaker]]'s dog from the Haunted Mansion and that they were the pups of, \"Loki\", the ghost dog seen by the mummy in the ride. They were the grandpups of [[Master Gracey]]'s pet, [[Hellhound]], and also descendants of the dog from Fort [[Mark Twain|Sam Clemens]] on [[Pirate's Lair on Tom Sawyer Island|Tom Sawyer Island]] and the [[Prison Dog]] from [[Pirates of the Caribbean (attraction)|Pirates of the Caribbean]].\n\n==Trivia==\n*In [[2017]], Rover was the subject of the [[Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom]] card \"Rover's Christmas Carousel of Progress\" given out exclusively at [[Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party]]. It is modeled after his position in the final scene. However, unlike in the attraction where he is wearing a Christmas bow, he is wearing a virtual reality headset that appears to be shooting out digital Christmas images.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"185\">\nSOTMK Carousel of Progress.jpeg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Carousel of Progress characters]]\n[[Category:Spell Cards characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Pets]]"
