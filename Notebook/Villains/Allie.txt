She is easily recognized by her purple bow on her head as well as a purple choker on her neck. Allie also has purple claws, scales and toes. She also has purple eyeshadow with two eyelashes. Allie has four teeth, two on each side (sometimes two on the right and one on the left), three spots on each leg and two faint stripes on her tail. Her chest is yellowish green resembling that of a dress. Her \"S\" shaped tail look's a lot like Swampy, except its longer and has a ball like tip at the end.\n\n==Role in ''[[Where's My Water?]]''==\nIn the game, Allie is the only female alligator to inhabit the city sewers. Being the only female, it is no surprise that Allie is the girlfriend of the clan's alpha male [[Cranky]]. In spite of their relationship, Allie gets rather annoyed by Cranky's rude and abrasive nature. Unknowing to Allie, an alligator misfit named Swampy has feelings for her, and tries his best to impress her. Though Allie finds his human-like qualities to be rather strange, she eventually lightens up to Swampy and begins to return the feelings. This angers Cranky which prompts him to make several attempts to sabotage their romance. Thanks to Allie's quick thinking, he ultimately fails.\n\n===''Allie's Story''===\nAllie also appears as the main character of the spin-off which is an in-app purchase in the first game, the story has 4 chapters. Here, players must assist Allie in helping her tune her steam powered organ, much like how they gave Swampy water to take a bath and Cranky purple water to dissolve his food. However, instead of water or purple water, players must use steam to help her. If the player uses water or purple water, he or she will fail and the level must be restarted. \n\n* \"Warming Up\": Swampy and Cranky build a huge organ as a special gift for Allie in her new organ room. \n* \"Tuning In\": Allie performs in a jazz concert while Swampy brings her food and Cranky takes a role of a security guard blocking two gators \n* \"Rising to the Top\": Allie performs in a rock concert awaking the city while Swampy serves out popcorn and t-shirts alongside with Cranky guarding the gate asking an alligator to pay a pair of fish. \n* \"Symphony in Steam\": In a theater, Allie performs as the conductor of an orchestra while Swampy and Cranky hold flowers as they watch Allie from behind the curtains. The ending shows Swampy and Cranky (unseen) throwing flowers and a fish to Allie for a great musical performance.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Allie is well known for her distinctive hum that sounds like a \"Yoo hoo\".\n*It's possible her full name (Allie Gator) could actually be a pun of \"Alligator\", which makes sense being that she is one.\n*Some fans predicted that her story might involve using a slimy fluid called Ooze, as Swampy used Water, and Cranky used Poison but no one used mud, though it's not clear how Mud would effectively be used.\n*It was confirmed, however, that Allie's story actually uses steam,\u00a0'''not'''\u00a0ooze.\n*As shown in\u00a0Allie's Story\u00a0she has a passion for music.\n*Allie is voiced by Rebecca Metz\n*She seems to resemble a caiman.\n*Just like all the Alligators in the sewer, Allie has four fingers and two toes. But real gators have 5 toes on the front legs while the back legs have only 4 toes.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\">\nWMW Title Allie.png\nAllie and Logo.png\nAllie and Logo 2.png\nAllie1.png\nWheres-My-Water-picture-7.jpg\nWheres-my-water-ipad-version-0.jpg\nWheres-my-water.jpg\nSwampy-300x132.jpg\nSwampy2.jpg\nSwampyAllie.png\nSwampy 03.jpg\nAllie.jpg|Allie plush\nCranky5.jpg|Allie with Cranky\nWhere-s-My-Water.jpg\nAllie Gator.jpg\nWhere My Water2.jpg\nAllie.png\n13382717245745.jpeg\nAlliepoint.png\nAlliescared.png\nAlliethink.png\nAlligator.png\nSwampyAllieCrankytub.jpg\nSwampy, his girlfriend Allie & Cranky head and logo.png\nAllie G6.png\nAllie and Cranky.png\nSWAMPY AND ALLIE.png\nSwampy and Allie happy to see each other.png\nSwampy and Allie coming out of the sewer.png\nAlliegator2.PNG\nAllie, Swampy and Cranky Lying Down with their Ducks.png\nSwampy and Allie Lying Down.png\nSwampy and Cranky high 5 with Allie.png\nSwampy & Allie in Boiling Point.png\nIT'S A BOMB!.png\nIT'S A BOMB!2.png\nDEDSEC17 Allie loves Swampy!!!.png\nSwampy Allie and Cranky.png\nSwampy- Will you be my dance partner Allie.png\nAllie Lying Down.png\nAllie G8.png\nAllie Head Eyes Open.png\nSwampy Allie & Cranky.png\nSwampy Allie & Cranky 2.png\nAllie and her Duck.png\nAllie Duck.png\nSwampy Allie & Cranky2.png\nAllie Gator.png\nAllieimpressed.png\nSwampy, Allie & Cranky doing the Conga.png\nWMW Allie unhappy at Cranky.png\nAllie G30.png\nWMW2 Allie 3.png\nWMW2 Allie Dancing.png\nWMW2 Allie 2.png\nSwampy and Allie Romance.png\nAllie holding umbrella.png\nA Rose for Allie.png\nMotherly Allie.png\nSAC_17.png\n</gallery>\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Alligators]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Where's My Water? characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Swampy's Underground Adventures characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in video games]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
