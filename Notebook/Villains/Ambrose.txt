He also makes a cameo alongside [[Dirty Bill]] in ''[[Mickey's Polo Team]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[The Robber Kitten]]''===\nAmbrose is his mother\u2019s only child and he lives only with her, due to his father\u2019s previous death (someone threw a boot at him). Maybe his father absence made Ambrose dislike being correct and honest, because the kitten only thinks about being a robber some day and hates obeying his mother, who wants him to go to school and have a nice future.\n\nOne day, his mother asks him to have a bath, but he doesn\u2019t listen to her and decides to runn away from home in order to become a criminal. In the woods next to his house, Ambrose meets the evil bandit known as Dirty Bill and tries to rob him, but gets surprised to find out who he really is and reveals himself to be Bill\u2019s fan. Then, the villain invites Ambrose to make a criminal duo with him and the kitten happily accepts, telling Bill a false story that he robbed an entire diligence by himself. Attempting to get the supposedly stolen money, Dirty Bill tries to kill Ambrose to steal his bag, imagining that the money is there. When Ambrose notices that he\u2019s in trouble, he gets scared and desperate and gives up being a criminal and runs back home, leaving a bag full of cookies to Bill, who is very confused to find that there wasn\u2019t any money in the bag. \n\nLater, Ambrose regrets his stupid decision, has his bath and promises to obey his mom from then on.\n\n===''[[Mickey's Polo Team]]''===\nAmbrose is seen alongside Dirty Bill, cheering in the crowd, amongst the other Silly Symphonies characters. It is unknown if Ambrose is back to his life of crime or if they\u2019re only friends. \n\n==Trivia==\n*Ambrose is similar to the fairytale character ''Puss in Boots''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\n22212.jpg\n22210.jpg\n22206.jpg\n22205.jpg\n054-011sack.jpg\n054-008sing.jpg\n054-007tongue.jpg\n054-004slaughter.jpg\n054-003headshot.jpg\n054-002stickup.jpg\n054-012murderous.jpg\n054-014deadman.jpg\nTumblr n1410lrls11qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg|Ambrose's cameo in ''Mickey's Polo Team''\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Silly Symphonies characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Cowboys & cowgirls]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]"
