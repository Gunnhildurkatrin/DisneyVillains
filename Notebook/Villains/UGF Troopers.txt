They are alien velociraptor-like guards who function as the backbone of the United Galactic Federation. They\u00a0serve as both the guards for captains of spacecraft, as well as the guards for those arrested or imprisoned. The species of the guards are called ''Raptorsellus'', and they are known to be temperamental when confronted or in battle.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch]]''===\nIn the original movie, Experiment 626 (later known as [[Stitch]]) was turned over to the\u00a0UGF Troopers for custody. One guard then used a [[Sample Extractor]] to take a sample of Stitch's blood, then inserted the syringe into a machine that analyzed the blood's DNA, allowing for two [[Plasma Blaster|plasma blasters]] on the ceiling to track Stitch's genetic signature and fire at him if he tries to escape. However, Stitch quickly exploited a weakness in the tracking just shortly thereafter and used it to escape. Near the end of the film, a large group of prison guards were seen surrounding Stitch after he was\u00a0apprehended and turned over to the [[Grand Councilwoman]], though he is later released from custody.\n\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch]]''===\nIn a flashback scene of ''Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch'', [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] was in his [[Jumba's Lab|laboratory]], where he had\u00a0just finished creating Stitch and\u00a0attempted to fully charge Stitch's molecules in order to prevent him from short-circuiting and dying. However, a UGF Trooper suddenly burst into the lab and apprehended Jumba for illegal experiment creating, thereby disrupting the process.\n\n===''[[Stitch! The Movie]]''===\nIn ''Stitch! The Movie'',\u00a0two UGF Troopers\u00a0were seen apprehending [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel]] after he had been successfully captured by [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], Stitch and Experiment 221 (recently\u00a0known as [[Sparky (Lilo & Stitch)|Sparky]]).\n\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nIn \"[[Finder (episode)|Finder]]\", several UGF Troopers\u00a0were seen hunting down H\u00e4msterviel after he had escaped from [[Prison Asteroid K-37|prison]], although\u00a0he managed to evade them. Near the end of the episode, two guards\u00a0were seen arresting H\u00e4msterviel again after he had been captured by [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]]; however, since Gantu had unintentionally kidnapped [[Mertle Edmonds]] in the process, the Grand Councilwoman rescinded her offer to\u00a0reinstate\u00a0Gantu to his former position as captain.\n\nIn \"[[Woops (episode)|Woops]]\", a couple of UGF Troopers were alerted after Experiment 600 ([[Woops]]) had been activated by H\u00e4msterviel and caused mayhem around the prison, which almost blew H\u00e4msterviel's cover in the process and as a result, H\u00e4msterviel was forced to send all of his captive experiments back to Earth on [[Gantu's Ship|Gantu's ship]].\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nIn ''Leroy & Stitch'', two UGF Troopers were seen standing on either side of the door, permitting Stitch (captain of the [[B.R.B. 9000]]) entry to rendezvous with the Grand Councilwoman.\u00a0It should be noted that these guards were wearing traditional captain uniforms similar to Stitch's, instead of their usual chemical protection suits.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The UGF Troopers somewhat resemble [[Stormtroopers]] from the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nAlntrop1mv.png\nAlientr1.png|A UGF Trooper in ''[[Disney's Stitch: Experiment 626]]''\n</gallery>\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Dinosaurs]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n\n[[Category:Soldiers]]\n[[Category:Police officers]]\n[[Category:Armies]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Military characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
