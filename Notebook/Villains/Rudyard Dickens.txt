"'''[[File:DGP_-_Kid_Riddle_Bio_img.jpg|thumb|251px]]Rudyard Dickens''', who prefers to go by the name '''Kid Riddle''', is one of the detectives from the video game ''[[Guilty Party]].''\n\n==Official Biography==\nThe son of [[Phoebe Dickens]]; Rudyard is the youngest member of the family - energetic and still fascinated by childish things. His famous grandfather looms larger than life in Rudyard's eyes, and he wishes he could be as cool as [[Dorian Dickens|the Commodore]]. To that end, he has created an alternate persona of Kid Riddle: masked mastermind, boy brainiac, and juvenile genius!\nWhen Rudyard dons his cape and cowl, the mild-mannered Rudyard can leap into the most confounding cases with courage and confidence. He has a flair for the dramatic; he occasionally offers explosive commentary on a case in the manner of an old-fashioned comic book. His enthusiasm often causes him to come up with wildy incorrect theories, but he usually makes up for it with energetic investigation.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dickens, Rudyard}}\n[[Category:Guilty Party characters]]\n[[Category:Detectives]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Interactive Studios characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in video games]]"
