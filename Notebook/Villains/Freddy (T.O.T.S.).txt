He is a T.O.T.S. baby deliverer and [[Pip (T.O.T.S.)|Pip]]'s best friend and partner.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nFreddy really loves his job in T.O.T.S. and loves it more when comes to delivering babies. Freddy is silly, fun loving, and full of excitement. He does get confused about things easily. He can also be very encouraging and kind to others.\nFreddy is the more caring partner of Team Pip and Freddy. He enjoys playing with the babies and taking care of them. Because of this, he sometimes notices things other fliers miss.\nAn example, when everyone was delivering bunnies and his and Pip's bunnies got mixed up with JP's, he figured out who was who based on traits he noticed while playing with them.\n\n===Physical Appearance===\nFreddy is a coral pink flamingo with dark yellow eyes and purple parts of the feathers of his wings. It has a golden yellow beak with the tip being black. Freddy wears the T.O.T.S. uniform, which consists of a buttoned shirt with the insignia of T.O.T.S., white buttons and a collar with the same colors of the shirt, and navy blue details in the sleeves, accompanying a light blue cap with the insignia of T.O.T.S.. He wears high navy blue sneakers. When he goes to sleep, he wears pajamas and a nightcap. For Halloween, he dressed up as a palm tree.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nTime to Fly with T.O.T.S..png\nDolphin Dive T.O.T.S..png\nPenguin Hug.png\nIMG 20200916 165841.png\nIMG 20200912 135652.png\nScreenshot 20201013-130121.jpg\nScreenshot 20201013-170148.jpg\nScreen Shot 2020-12-29 at 11.53.50 AM.png|Freddy\nScreenshot_(189).png|Freddy smiling|link=Freddy (T.O.T.S.)\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Each time he sings, \"[[Bringing This Baby Home|And I do the flapping]],\" he gets a cloud accessory.\n*In \"[[Out Foxed]],\" he is an expert at hide and seek.\n*In \"[[Lost Lovey]],\" he once owned a stuffed monkey named Mr. Muffins, but he gave him away to Mia after they lost her lost lovey toy, Lady Foo Foo.\n*He is the only T.O.T.S. flyer to wear shoes.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{T.O.T.S.}}\n[[Category:T.O.T.S. characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Flamingos]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]"
