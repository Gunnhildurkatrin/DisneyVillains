He is a science teacher at [[Auradon Prep]].\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Descendants]]''===\nOn [[Evie]]'s first day in class, Mr. Deley attempts to humiliate her by asking about the atomic weight of silver. Evie manages to count it correctly with the [[Magic Mirror]] hidden in her hand.\n\nWhen it came time for a test, [[Chad Charming]] takes her mirror and gives it to Mr. Deley, who thanks Chad for giving it to him and later uses it as an excuse to expel her. But [[Doug (Descendants)|Doug]] begs him to give Evie a chance. He then agrees to return Evie's mirror and let the matter slip if she passes the test, which she does in the end. To her delight, Evie feels a fulfillment never felt by this success.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nMr. Deley and Chad.jpg\n09.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Descendants}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Deley, Mr.}}\n[[Category:Descendants characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Schoolteachers]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
