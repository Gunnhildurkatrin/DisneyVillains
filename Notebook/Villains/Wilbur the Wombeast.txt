On the outside, he looks scary and vicious, but on the inside, he's a clumsy and yet lonely critter who has no family and loves apples. He appears in the ''[[Sofia the First]]'' episode \"[[Great Aunt-Venture]]\".\n\n==Role in the series==\n[[Sofia the First (character)|Sofia]] and [[Aunt Tilly]] first met Wilbur on unfriendly terms when he came out of nowhere and stole the apples they'd picked for an apple pie. Using the Locus Pocus Map, Sofia and Aunt Tilly find him in the Horrid Hills. Sofia's magical [[Amulet of Avalor|Amulet]] allows her to convince Wilbur to give back their apples and understand that he's all alone with no family. After befriending Wilbur, Sofia and Aunt Tilly secretly invite him to their family dinner, and they have some of Aunt Tilly's special apple pie.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"180\" captionalign=\"center\">\nSofia and Wilbert.png|Giving back the apples\nTumblr mvg4gzGHdl1qlpgkfo2 1280.png|Pat on the head\nGreat-Aunt-Venture-18.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Sofia the First}}\n[[Category:Sofia the First characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
