He is the mayor of [[Wartwood Swamp]].\u00a0\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nMayor Toadstool is a shady mayor. He cheats out everyone for his own greedy desires and cares more about his image. He considers everyone, especially Anne and the Plantars, beneath him and is not afraid to openly voice his disdain for them. He is remarkably clever however and a quick plotter; loving to cash in on an opportunity when it falls in his lap.\n\nHe does show off a reasonably honorable side however. He was willing to hold up his end of any deals or bargains that he took part in. He will also risk his life to protect and save the people of Wartwood, though he admits it is for his own greedy benefit (though judging by the manner of how he said it, he probably meant it in a joking manner).\n\n===Physical appearance===\n{{Stubsection}}\n\n==Trivia==\n* He shares similarities with [[Prince John]] as both were greedy corrupt official who collecting taxes from poverty to become the richest in the world. Their differences is that Prince John is a villain while Mayor Toadstool isn't.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nMayor_Toadstool_render.png|Render\nAnne or Beast 4.jpg\nHop Luck 3.jpg\nHop Luck 4.jpg\nBreakout Star 7.jpg\nBreakout Star 9.png\nBreakout Star 10.jpg\nHop-Popular 2.png\nHop-Popular 3.png\nThe Big Bugball - Townies.png\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*[[w:c:amphibiapedia:Mayor Toadstool|Mayor Toadstool]] at the [[w:c:amphibiapedia:Main Page|Amphibia Wiki]]\n\n{{Amphibia}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Amphibia characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Mayors]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Anti-villains]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Politicians]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Toads]]"
