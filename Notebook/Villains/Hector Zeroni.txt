He was from the D-tent.\nHector's great-great-great-grandmother, [[Madame Zeroni]], was a one-legged gypsy. She was the woman who placed a curse on [[Stanley Yelnats IV|Stanley Yelnats]]<nowiki/>' family because Stanley's great-great grandfather [[Elya Yelnats|Elya]]\u00a0did not fulfill his end of the bargain with her.\n\nHector grew up living in many different places, having no real home. His mother abandoned him at the park one day for unknown reasons and never came back. At the end of the book/film, Hector is  reunited with his mother and it is revealed she had been looking for him as well.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"180\">\nFile:Zeroni.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Holes}}\n[[Category:Holes characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Deuteragonists]]\n[[Category:Romani characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]"
