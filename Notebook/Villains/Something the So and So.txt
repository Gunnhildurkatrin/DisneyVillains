He completely messed up his speech, however, resulting in [[Emperor Awesome]] telling him to go away and come back when he was better prepared.\n\n\nIn \"[[The Matchmaker (Wander Over Yonder)|The Matchmaker]]\", he appears again wanting to do something evil but is once again confused on what to do. Wander tells him that he would normally take 11 minutes to do this but asks if this is what he really wants to do with his life. Then Something questions his career choice and then says goodbye and walks away.\n\nHe will join [[Wander]] and a group of rebels to fight [[Lord Dominator]] in \"[[The End of the Galaxy]].\"\n\n==Appearances==\n*\"[[The It]]\" (1st appearance)\n*\"[[The Battle Royale]]\"\n*\"[[The Matchmaker (Wander Over Yonder)|The Matchmaker]]\"\n*\"[[The End of the Galaxy]]\"{{Wander Over Yonder}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Something the So and So}}\n[[Category:Wander Over Yonder characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
