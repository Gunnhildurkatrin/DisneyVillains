He was voiced by [[Slim Pickens]].\n\n==Background==\nB.O.B. was the last one of his type to be still aboard the [[U.S.S. Cygnus]]. Over the years, he had been abused and bullied by the other robots such as [[S.T.A.R.]], calling him a \"freak.\" He suffered a lot of severe damage from being beaten up a lot.\n\nHis closet friend became [[V.I.N.CENT]] and the only one who was against [[Hans Reinhardt|Hans Reinhardt's]] insane plans to enter the black hole. He told the crew of the Palomino what really happened to the crew and showed V.I.N.CENT what was left of them.\n\nAs the Cygnus started to tear apart, the Palonimo crew tried to escape to probe ship. As the crew was escaping, B.O.B. was shot by [[Maximilian]] after protecting the Palonimo crew, but V.I.N.CENT defeated him in a duel. V.I.N.CENT tried to help B.O.B., but B.O.B. was finished and in his last moments he bid his new friend farewell.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Production Concept===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\">\nOld_B_O_B__Behind_the_Scenes.jpg|B.O.B. on set\nOld_B_O_B__Concept_Sketch_by_George_McGinnis.jpg|Concept sketch by George McGinnis\n</gallery>\n\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\">\nBlack-hole-disneyscreencaps.com-9033.jpg\nCap047.JPG\nVincent_and_Bob.jpeg\nOld_B_O_B__Screencap_06.jpg|B.O.B. and V.I.N.CENT's first meeting\nOld_B_O_B__Screencap_07.jpg\nOld_B_O_B__Screencap_19.jpg|B.O.B. shows V.I.N.CENT what's left of the old crew\nOld_B_O_B__Screencap_21.jpg\nOld_B_O_B__Screencap_27.jpg|B.O.B. in his last moments\nB.O.B..png|B.O.B. as a badge in ''[[Disney Heroes: Battle Mode]]''\n\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Black Hole}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Black Hole characters]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Those destroyed]]\n\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Machines]]"
