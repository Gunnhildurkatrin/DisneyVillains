His name is derived from the pendant he wears.\n\n==Characteristics==\nZafiro differs from the other surviving gargoyles in his clan in that, instead of having two legs and leathery wings, he resembles a feathery winged serpent. Since all other known gargoyles are six limbed, it is possible that Zafiro's skeleton still retains tiny vestigial legs. Despite being the only surviving gargoyle with this snake-like body structure, it is apparently quite common among Mayan gargoyles, with at least half of the members having it, on average. The eggs due to hatch in 1998 will reflect this fact; most of them will have serpentine bodies as well. He is also the only surviving member of the clan to have white hair and a distinctly reptilian eyes and jaw. How common or rare these traits are is unknown.\n\n==History==\n===Past===\n[[File:Zafiro.jpg|thumb|250px]]\nZafiro and the other three pendant-bearers were away from the pyramid in [[1993]] when someone attacked the clan, smashing the sleeping gargoyles and looting the pyramid. When he and the others returned, they vowed never to leave the pyramid unguarded again.\n\n===Present===\nIn [[1996]], Cyberbiotics began to encroach on the Mayan Clan's territory, bringing Zafiro into direct conflict with them. [[Preston Vogel]] hired Jackal and Hyena to remove the gargoyles by any means necessary. When the [[Avalon]] Travelers arrived, Zafiro enlisted their help in defending their territory.\n\n===Future===\nHe may later visit [[New York City]] to recover the [[Mayan Sun Amulet]], though how he would journey there is unknown. Zafiro and [[Obsidiana]] will be the ancestors of Zafiro II.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Zafiro's appearance suggests that gargoyles of his variety in Central America could be the origin for the legends in that part of the world about feathered serpents. In Mesoamerican legend, these serpents are known as couatl, and dwell in the depths of the rain forest. They are also linked to the legend of Quetzalcoatl, a culture-god of the Aztecs who was often depicted as a feathered serpent. In the Gargoyles Universe, the story of Quetzalcoatl could well be a distorted memory of gargoyles that looked very much like Zafiro.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.gargwiki.net/Zafiro Zafiro] at [https://www.gargwiki.net/Main_Page GargWiki]\n\n{{Gargoyles}}\n[[Category:Gargoyles characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Gargoyles]]\n[[Category:Snakes]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]\n[[Category:Hybrids]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]"
