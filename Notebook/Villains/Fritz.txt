Clashing with Jose's out of control ego leads to his attempts at a solo career and the eventual break-up of the band. Additionally, when intern Chip's attempt at subbing for Jose results in disaster, Fritz fires him and the human ends up trying to start his own Tiki island resort.\n\nEventually, he and the others come together to help rescue Michael, resulting in the band's reformation.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nRSCN7075.JPG|Fritz with [[Jos\u00e9]], [[Pierre]] and [[Michael]] in ''[[It's a Small World: The Animated Series]]''.\ntumblr_ocfgnhrfYi1sa3t1go1_540.jpg|[[Disney Kingdoms: Enchanted Tiki Room]] variant cover\nTiki birds Card.jpg|Fritz with Michael, Pierre and Jos\u00e9 on a [[Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom]] Christmas promo card.\n</gallery>\n\n{{Enchanted Tiki Room}}\n{{Disney Kingdoms}}\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Parrots]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:German characters]]\n[[Category:Kinect Disneyland Adventures characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Enchanted Tiki Room characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Infinity characters]]\n[[Category:Tales from Adventureland characters]]\n[[Category:Spell Cards characters]]\n[[Category:Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Kingdoms characters]]"
