Stanley is a good-hearted teenager born to a luckless family who have been cursed for years. He is a very responsible, nice, caring teenager. It is revealed that he cares about [[Hector Zeroni|Zero]]. He is the luckiest of the Yelnats descendants.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Holes]]''===\nAfter being tried and 'proven' guilty of stealing [[Clyde Livingston|Clyde \"Sweetfeet\" Livingston's]] shoes, he was sent to [[Camp Green Lake]], a detention camp in [[Texas]] run by [[Warden Walker]]. It is revealed that he cares about [[Hector Zeroni|Zero]]. Ironically, it was Yelnats' acceptance of Zero that lifted the curse on his family and led to the proof that he was innocent.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* His last name is his first name backwards.\n*He broke the Yelnats Curse by carrying Hector Zeroni \u2014 the descendant of Madame Zeroni, the spellcaster \u2014 up to [[God's Thumb]], giving him the water from the stream and singing the pig lullaby.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nStanley Close Up.jpg\nStanley with Lizards.jpg\nStanley 2.PNG\nStanley wearing Hat.jpg\nWarden (8).png\nWarden (9).png|\"While Mr. Sir was filling our canteens, I slipped into his truck and, er, stole his sunflower seeds.\"\nWarden (12).png|\"And there's still some in my hole, you could check.\"\nWarden (16).png\nWarden (17).png\nWarden (18).png\nWarden (19).png\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Holes}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Yelnats IV, Stanley}}\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Holes characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:American characters]]"
