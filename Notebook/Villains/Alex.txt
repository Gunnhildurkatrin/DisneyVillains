He is a young merman who meets [[Melody]] in [[Atlantica]].\n\n==Background==\n===Physical appearance===\nDespite Alex being at least under 15 years old, he has a muscular build. He also has tan skin, green eyes, neck-length blond hair, and a green tail.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\n====Powers====\n*'''Superhuman Durability:''' As a merman, Alex is far more durable than normal humans and even certain aquatic/marine creatures; for example, he is able to withstand the immense underwater pressures.\n*'''Speed Swimming:''' As a merman, Alex is capable of swimming much faster than normal humans and even certain aquatic/marine creatures in terms of undersea travel or sea travel; for example, he was able to get to Prince Eric's kingdom from [[Atlantica]] in less than a day.\n*'''Underwater Breathing:''' As a merman, Alex is able to metabolize oxygen from the water, which negates the need to surface; although he is certainly more than capable of breathing on land.\n*'''Aquapathy:''' As a merman, Alex is capable of speaking with aquatic fauna; as he can understand and communicate with aquatic/marine creatures.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Alex is (presumably) a love interest for [[Melody]]; since she immediately develop a crush on him from the moment they met.\n*He sorta bears a little bit of a resemblance to the human boy Melody danced with at her 12th Birthday Party.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nAlex merman.jpg\nAlex 2.jpg|Melody and Alex.\nAlex 3.jpg|Alex, the mergirl and the Asian merboy.\nAlex 4.jpg|Melody loves Alex.\nAlex TLM II.jpg\nLittle-mermaid2-disneyscreencaps_com-5506.jpg\nlittle-mermaid2-disneyscreencaps.com-5520.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Little Mermaid}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Scandinavian characters]]\n[[Category:The Little Mermaid characters]]\n[[Category:Hybrids]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Mermen]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
