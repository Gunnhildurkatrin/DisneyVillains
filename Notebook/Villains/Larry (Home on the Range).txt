He gets along very well with his fellow farm animals and hardly has any worries or obligations. He also seems to enjoy the rare experiences that take place, especially the [[Chugwater|town]] fair.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Home on the Range]]''===\nLarry is first seen during the \"[[Little Patch of Heaven]]\" music number helping [[Pearl Gesner|Pearl]] around the\u00a0[[Little Patch of Heaven (farm)|farm]]. He collects a bushel of corn for [[Ollie]] and the [[piggies]] to eat. Larry is later present when [[Maggie]] first arrives on the farm and stares at her with awe and wonder, as do the other farm animals, before she is welcomed by [[Mrs. Calloway]].\n\nLater, when Pearl's livestock face losing their\u00a0farm due to a bank notice that she hasn't been able to pay yet, Larry is the first one to encourage Maggie when she has a lucrative idea. Sometime later, Maggie, Mrs. Calloway, and [[Grace]] go on a quest to capture outlaw [[Alameda Slim]] and use the reward money to save Little Patch of Heaven.\n\nAfter some time passes, Larry and the other farm animals start to worry about the cows, especially\u00a0when [[Jeb]] makes a negative statement about it, causing\u00a0Larry to be\u00a0suspicious and\u00a0agree\u00a0with the old goat. When the other farm animals panic, thinking the cows abandoned them and will never return, Ollie manages to calm everyone down by shouting to get their attention. He then tries to lighten things up by telling Larry and the farm animals that there's nothing those cows can't do.\n\nIn the film's climax, Larry helps the three cows (who have returned from their journey) battle a disguised Alameda Slim after he attempts to kill the bovines. Larry and the farm animals succeed in defeating Slim, who is then arrested by [[Sheriff Sam Brown]]. After Pearl uses the reward money to pay the bank's debt for Little Patch of Heaven, a photographer takes a picture of Pearl and her livestock, with Larry and\u00a0everyone else smiling save Jeb.\n\nLarry is last seen dancing with all the other farm animals as they celebrate Pearl's farm being saved and re-opened.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Out of all the farm animals, Larry has the fewest speaking lines.\n\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\">\nClipduck.gif|Larry with [[Audrey (Home on the Range)|Audrey]]\nClipcows21.gif\n5173-28214.gif\nnormal DisneyEnchantedPDVD 040.jpg\nnormal DisneyEnchantedPDVD 100.jpg\nnormal DisneyEnchantedPDVD 114.jpg\nHome-on-the-range-disneyscreencaps com-1127.jpg\nnormal_DisneyEnchantedPDVD_124.jpg\nHome-on-the-range-disneyscreencaps com-7998.jpg|Larry and the farm animals cheering after Pearl's farm is saved.\nPearlandFarmAnimals.jpg\nHome-on-the-range-disneyscreencaps com-8312.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Home on the Range}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Home on the Range characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Farm animals]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]"
