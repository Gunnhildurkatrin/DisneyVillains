He also doesn't take kindly to trespassers, namely those who are not \"cows\", according to him. He talks in a deep, ominous voice and tries to maintain his composure when agitated. Like [[Grace]], Junior is immune to [[Alameda Slim]]'s yodeling, but for Junior, it's because he is a bison, and Slim's yodeling only affects cattle; whereas Grace (who is a cow) is tone-deaf. He also seems to have a bit of crush on Mrs. Calloway, as he behaves in a rather flirtatious manner towards her (like when he's complementing her hat.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Home on the Range]]''===\nJunior is Alameda Slim's valiant \"steed\". Unusual for a villain's sidekick, he is portrayed as neither good nor bad, just simply doing his job. He is very polite to cows and even flirts with Mrs. Calloway upon seeing her by complimenting her hat. He also tires of [[Buck]]'s arrogance when the horse attempts to get through [[Echo Mine]]'s entrance, despite Junior saying repeatedly, \"Cows only.\"\n\nLater in the film, [[Maggie]], Mrs. Calloway and Grace show up along with [[Lucky Jack]] (a jackrabbit who helped the cows reach Echo Mine), and Junior lets all four of them pass. When Buck questions Junior about this, the buffalo states, \"They're cows,\" and when Buck brings up the rabbit, Junior replies, \"Well, obviously, he was with the cows.\" Buck tries convincing Junior that he was with the cows too, but to no avail.\n\nSometime later, Buck tricks [[Patrick (Home on the Range)|another horse]] into leaving his post so he could get back with [[Rico]] and then gloats. However, Buck is overheard by Junior who snorts angrily, as he had been right behind him. Junior is later seen chasing Buck around Echo Mine. He is shown to be immensely strong and survives a considerable fall after the cows inadvertently push him down the mine shaft. Junior soon makes his way out of the mine shaft and continues chasing Buck, but turns away after hearing Slim, who had been captured by the cows, calling for him.\n\nAt the end of the movie, Junior has left the services of Alameda Slim (since Slim is in jail) and arrives, along with [[Barry and Bob]], at [[Little Patch of Heaven (farm)|Little Patch of Heaven]], where he courts Mrs. Calloway. He also dances with all the other farm animals as they celebrate [[Pearl Gesner|Pearl]]'s farm being saved and re-opened.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nClipslimride.gif|[[Alameda Slim|Slim]] riding Junior.\nnormal_DisneyEnchantedPDVD_370.jpg|\"Cows only\".\nnormal_DisneyEnchantedPDVD_380.jpg|Junior with [[Buck]].\nHome-on-the-range-disneyscreencaps.com-6341.jpg|Junior snorts behind Buck.\nJuniortheBuffalo.jpg|\"And the joker is wild.
