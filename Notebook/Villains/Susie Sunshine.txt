She first appeared in the episode \"Tea Party Tantrum\", when she was cranky and didn't want to play tea party. [[Dottie McStuffins|Doc]] takes her to the clinic for a check-up. Susie refuses to do what Doc tells her to do in her check-up in some places, but listens to her tiredly. Doc finds some pineapple ice pop drops stuck in her eyes and wipes them away. Susie is glad but tired, so Doc and her friends put her down for a nap to recharge her. When she wakes up, she happily thanks Doc and plays tea party with her, [[Lambie]] and [[Stuffy]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*\"[[Tea Party Tantrum]]\" (first appearance)\n*\"[[Hallie's Happy Birthday]]\"\n*\"[[Through the Reading Glasses]]\" (cameo)\n*\"[[Break Dancer]]\" (cameo)\n*\"[[The Big Storm]]\"\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nsusie sunshine as she appears in doc's summertime clinic.jpg|Susie Sunshine as she appears in the game Doc's Summertime Clinic\n</gallery>\n\n{{Doc McStuffins}}\n[[Category:Dolls]]\n[[Category:Toys]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Doc McStuffins characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]"
