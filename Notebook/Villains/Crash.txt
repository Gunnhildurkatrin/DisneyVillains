He is a [[Whatnots|whatnot]] and a living puppet with many interesting abilities such as eating sandwiches the size of basketballs and eating a watermelon with a straw, and he comes with ninja weapons, such as ninja swords and a small cannon. Crash was created by [[Wyatt Bernstein]] and then came to life. Crash is a extreme, crazy, loud, and daredevilish puppet. Crash, apparently becomes Wyatt's adoptive brother. Crash also bathes in the toilet because he doesn't like going in public pools because of what kids do in there. Crash \"faceslams\" people that he loves, especially Wyatt as it is when Crash slams his head into the other person's head. Crash uses himself as a basketball. Crash can't spell, milkshakes go right through him. His eyes were the inspiration for ping pong balls, as said in a promo. Crash watches a lot of telenovelas and wrestling.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Crash hosted a public service announcement in all episodes (including subsequent airings of the first episode) where he says the following words: ''\"I am made of cloth and stuffing. All the wild and crazy awesome things I do on the show cannot hurt me or anyone else. You, however, are not made of cloth and stuffing. So keep it real and leave all the mayhem and face-slamming to me. Rock on.\"''\n*He resembles [[Walter]] from ''[[The Muppets (film)|The Muppets]]''.\n*He was the mascot of [[Disney XD]], until he was replaced by [[Future-Worm|Future-Worm!]]\n*In Disney XD's Pranksgiving, He gotta prank [[Randy Cunningham|Randy]] replacing Randy's [[Ninja Balls]] with Crash's Prank Ninja Ball to prank him in [[Norrisville High]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\">\nCrash Whatnot.jpg\nCrash 2.0.png\nSlash and Bern Crash Slicing Foods.png\nbd8c789d817b48d9f95ec9be7b278bea507dd8aa.jpg\nCrash (Roblox item).png|Crash in ''[[Roblox]]''\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Crash & Bernstein characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]"
