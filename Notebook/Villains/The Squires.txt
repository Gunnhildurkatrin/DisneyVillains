Their fellow squire [[Unwin]] teases them as much as he teases [[Cavin]].\n\nTogether they face, and fail to defeat, the [[Mysterious Knight]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=190 spacing=small position=center captionalign=center>\nScreen Shot 2014-10-21 at 2.51.11 pm.png|Gar and Roland with Unwin\nScreen Shot 2014-10-21 at 5.07.02 pm.png|All three, ready to fight\nScreen Shot 2014-10-21 at 5.15.27 pm.png|The Squires facing the Mysterious Knight\nScreen Shot 2014-10-21 at 6.01.14 pm.png|Unwin bragging to the Squires\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n{{Adventures of the Gummi Bears}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Squires}}\n[[Category:Adventures of the Gummi Bears characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]"
