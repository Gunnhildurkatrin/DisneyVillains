He made his first appearance in ''The Lion Guard: Return of the Roar''.\n\n== Physical appearance ==\nShingo looks near-identical to his fellow giraffes. His fur is pale brown and dotted with orange spots, and he has a brown mane that extends up his neck. His muzzle is dark brown, and his eyes are brown.\n\n==Personality==\nShingo is friendly and gleeful. He can be a little inexperienced and easily tempted by food. However, he can be offensive when he feels he's been oppressed. He gets jittery when he hears of hyenas and will do anything to stay safe.\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== ''[[The Lion Guard: Return of the Roar]]'' ===\nWhen Kion and Bunga are playing Baobab Ball, they run alongside Shingo and his herd. The two friends leap into the air, and Shingo watches their progress, even bumping the ball with his snout when it soars toward him.\n\n=== [[Bunga the Wise]] ===\nDuring a flood, Bunga gets an idea to dam up Lake Kiziwa. After the plan works, Shingo and Thurston approach, complimenting Bunga on his wisdom. While the animals are talking, the dam begins to leak, and Bunga blocks it up with a stick, once more impressing Shingo and Thurston.\n\nLater that day, Shingo appears standing in line to get advice from Bunga the Wise. He tells Bunga that the other animals believe he is stuck-up because his head is so high in the sky and wonders what he can do to fix the problem. Bunga simply tells him to tie a knot in his neck. Satisfied, Shingo leaves.\n\nWhen Bunga gathers an entourage of followers, Shingo joins in, singing Bunga's praises alongside the other Pride Landers. The rest of the Lion Guard approaches, and Kion tells Bunga that he gives bad advice, to which Shingo gasps in horror. Timon reminds Kion that the dam had been Bunga's idea, and Shingo whoops with approval. However, the dam breaks before their eyes, and the Pride Landers flee for cover.\n\nAlongside the other panicked animals, Shingo follows the Lion Guard into a canyon, where the group is trapped at a dead-end. Shingo turns to Bunga for advice, but Bunga admits that he does not know what to do and asks Kion for help. Thinking quickly, Kion uses the Roar of the Elders to direct the floodwaters backward and save the trapped animals.\n\nAfter the water is pushed back, Shingo joins the other Pride Landers at the new water hole the flood has created.\n\n=== [[Follow that Hippo|Follow that Hippo!]] ===\nShingo is grazing peacefully when a group of children pretending to be hyenas frighten him into thinking that hyenas are attacking. He cowers alongside the other Pride Landers until the Lion Guard announces that it had been a false alarm.\n\nNot long after this, Shingo and several other animals come before Beshte, expressing their worries about the hyenas. Beshte reassures the animals that they are safe, but Thurston declares that zebras are the tastiest animals in the Pride Lands, to which Shingo rolls his eyes.\n\n=== [[The Trouble With Galagos]] ===\nOno informs the Lion Guard that Shingo is stuck in a tree in Ukuni Woods. The Lion Guard sets out to free Shingo, whose neck is stuck in the branches of an acacia tree. Bunga climbs up the trunk and carefully pries Shingo's neck and tongue free, allowing him to escape the branches of the acacia. Once free, Shingo proceeds to graze on another acacia tree.\n\n=== [[Never Roar Again]] ===\nShingo and the other giraffes are unable to access their water hole when it is blocked off by boulders. The Lion Guard arrives to help, and Shingo and Twiga laugh at Ono for his missing crest feathers. After Beshte clears the boulders, Shingo goes to drink the water.\n\n=== [[Ono's Idol]] ===\nShingo notices a large flock of birds flying over a watering hole. Later, Shingo appears during [[Hadithi]]'s Royal Mud Print Ceremony.\n\n=== [[Let Sleeping Crocs Lie]] ===\nShingo watches the  Mashindano between Makuu and [[Kiburi]].\n\n=== [[The Bite of Kenge]] ===\nShingo is seen during the song \"[[Big Bad Kenge]].\"\n\n=== [[The Golden Zebra]] ===\nWhen a drought hits the Pride Lands, Shingo and his herd argue with Vuruga Vuruga's herd over who should have the next drink, worried that they'll miss out entirely. Kion tries to calm them but is ultimately forced to seek advice from his father regarding the situation.\n\nLater, having found a solution, the Lion Guard leads the herds through the Back Lands where they are introduced to  [[Dhahabu]] the golden zebra, who welcomes them into their watering hole, n the condition that they frolic and romp. They accept her proposal and enjoy the water.\n\n=== [[The Scorpion's Sting]] ===\nShingo attends the Kumbuka celebration for Simba.\n\n=== [[Beshte and the Beast]] ===\nShingo and his herd are at the Watering Hole and Thurston's herd is trying to get through but Bunga says that they have to wait. [[Shujaa]] comes by and starts to attack trees. The giraffes and zebras start to panic and run Kion asks Beshte and Ono to calm them down.\n\n=== [[The Queen's Visit]] ===\nShingo watches as Queen Dhahabu and her herd come into the Pride Lands and go up to Pride Rock.\n\n=== [[The Fall of Mizimu Grove]] ===\nShingo is at Mizimu Grove with his herd watching [[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]] as they sing their song \"[[Tujiinue]]\" However,  Scar's Army comes and crashes the party. Soon Scar reveals himself in front of everyone. He explains his plan then goes away once gone the herds start to panic and run. Once all calmed the herds start thinking about leaving the Pride Lands. The next morning at Pride Rock Kion makes an announcement. They head back to Mizimu Grove and Makini Mpando Mpaya survived the attack. The herds all decided to stay in the Pride Lands.\n\n=== [[Fire From The Sky]] ===\nShingo and his herd are scared by the fire falling from the sky. Kion and Fuli get the giraffes to safety. Once the fire is out they go back home. They are later seen during the song \"[[Height and Sight]].\"\n\n=== [[Battle for the Pride Lands]] ===\nShingo and his herd say goodbye to the Lion Guard as they go to the Tree of Life.\n\n=== [[Return to the Pride Lands]] ===\nShingo watches as Kion becomes the king of the Tree of Life.\n\n== Relationships ==\n\n=== Friends ===\n[[Twiga]]\n\nThe two seem to be good friends since Shingo is a part of her herd. They are seen together when their herd's watering hole is blocked. They even laugh together at Ono when he lost his crest feathers and misunderstands them and when Bunga only made them laugh even more when he attempts to defend Ono.\n\n[[Thurston]]\n\nThough they don't interact much, Shingo does scoff at Thurston for claims zebras are the most delicious animals in the Pride Lands causing Thurston to snap at him saying that it's true and tell him to deal with it.\n\n[[Bunga]]\n\nThey seem to be good friends, as seen when Kion and Bunga frolic across the Pride Lands, he gently bounces their baobab fruit in the air as they play Baobab Ball as seen at the beginning of \"Return of the Roar.\" In \"[[Bunga the Wise (episode)]]\" hen Shingo notices Bunga when he orders the Lion Guard to push down a large rock which prevents Lake Kaziwa from flooding and is very impressed by the honey badger's work and compliments Bunga. When a small leak occurs, he is once again impressed as Bunga immediately came up with a solution - to put a stick in it.\n\nSoon after that Shingo gathers with several other animals at Hakuna Matata Falls, awaiting advice from ''Bunga the Wise''. When it's his turn, Shingo asks Bunga how he can be noticed, as everyone can't see him up so high. Bunga tells him to tie his neck in a knot. Even later, he joins the other animals with ''Bunga the Wise - The Pride Lands Tour'' singing \"Make way for Bunga the Wise.\" When Kion tells Bunga that he gives bad advice, this causes Shingo to gasp. When Timon reminds Kion that Bunga came up with the idea for the dam fix, Shingo cries out in elate support, showing that he trusts him.\n\n[[Kion]]\n\nhe two seem to be good friends seeing as how Kion and the Guard had saved him on numerous occasions. Shingo also takes part in playing Baobab Ball with Kion and Bunga as he gently bounces their baobab fruit in the air.\n\n[[Ono]]\n\nThought the two are on good terms as Ono was the one who immediately that Shingo was stuck in a tree as seen in \"[[The Trouble With Galagos]].\" Though later on when Ono lost crest feathers Shingo orders the bird to wait his turn, calling him an ''egghead'' when Shingo and his herd's watering hole has been cut off by some boulders. Shingo even laughs at Ono for not only his bald head but for misunderstanding him.\n\n[[Beshte]] and [[Fuli]]\n\nShingo is on good terms with Beshte and Fuli.\n\n[[Simba]]\n\nShingo and Simba are good friends.
