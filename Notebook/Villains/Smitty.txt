He wears a blue jacket with red innards over a white and lime green striped long-sleeve shirt, blue pants with a red patch on the seat, and brown shoes. He also wears a beanie matching his shirt by colors.\n\n==Appearances==\n=== ''[[Dumbo (1941 film)|Dumbo]]''===\nSmitty is among the children attending the circus, as well as the ringleader of a young group of mischievous boys. When they see [[Dumbo (character)|Dumbo]], they immediately begin laughing at him due to his abnormally large ears. Smitty first mocks the elephant by holding up his jacket in imitation of Dumbo's ears. While Dumbo thinks that Smitty is simply playing around, [[Mrs. Jumbo]] immediately realizes what\u2019s going on and moves him out of the way of the bullies. Smitty then goes off limits by entering the pen, dragging Dumbo from under her by his tail, and blowing in his ear. After Dumbo tries to escape him, he grabs the other ear, stretches it, and lets go, hitting Dumbo in the face. Having had enough of Smitty\u2019s abuse, Mrs. Jumbo grabs the bully as he tries to escape and spanks him. This causes a commotion among the circus staff, culminating in Mrs. Jumbo being locked up and separated from her son. He is not seen again after that.\n\n==Trivia==\n* He is similar, both in looks and personality, to [[Lampwick]] from the 1940 film, ''[[Pinocchio (film)|Pinocchio]]''.\n\n{{Dumbo}}\n[[Category:Dumbo characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
