To impress [[Lily Houghton]] and secure a deal in providing transport down river as well as show off in front of the town, he staged a fight with Proxima in the middle of the cantina in Porto Velho. Living aboard the ''La Quila'' on the lower deck, [[McGregor Houghton|McGregor]] discovers her when going down to the lower deck during the expedition and the staged fight ends up playing into Lily's suspicions of Frank during the journey. When Frank reveals the truth of his past as a conquistador cursed with immortality, he describes Proxima as only the latest of his various pet wildcats over the centuries, with the name simply meaning \"The next one\" in Spanish, though he continually tells the current Proxima that she's his favorite. Proxima ends up accompanying Frank and the Houghtons on their return to civilization and [[London]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nFile:DSA Frank Wolff.png|In [[Disney Sorcerer's Arena]]\nFile:Jungle Cruise ReAction Figure - Proxima.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n\n*''[https://junglecruise.fandom.com/wiki/Proxima Proxima]'' on the ''[https://junglecruise.fandom.com/wiki/Jungle_Cruise_Wiki Jungle Cruise Wiki]''\n{{Jungle Cruise}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Jungle Cruise characters]]\n[[Category:Jaguars]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Disney Sorcerer's Arena Characters]]"
