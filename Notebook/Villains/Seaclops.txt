As his name suggests, he is an enormous aquatic cyclops that enjoys sleeping peacefully in which he becomes constantly irritated by out-of-tune music; despite his behavior, he constantly calms down whenever he listens to Ariel playing the harp gently.\n\nHe appeared in the episode \"[[Calliope Dreams]]\".\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[The Little Mermaid (TV series)|The Little Mermaid: The Series]]''===\nThe Seaclops prefers to sleep every thousand years, but when [[Ariel]]'s unskilled calliope playing wakes him 600 years earlier, he starts causing havoc across Atlantica. [[King Triton]] has to come to the realization that it is the Seaclops who is responsible for destroying the calliope used by his grandfather [[Neptune (The Little Mermaid)|Neptune]].\n\nAll of [[Sebastian]]'s attempts to lull the Seaclops back to sleep result in becoming futile, unable to calm the monster. However, Ariel starts playing the harp that had fallen to the ocean floor that finally lulls the Seaclops back to sleep. As a precaution, Triton relocates the monster to the underwater mountain range far from Atlantica.\n\n==Printed media==\nIn the third issue of the [[Marvel Comics]] [[The Little Mermaid (Marvel Comics)|serial]], the Seaclops acts as the main antagonist, having been prematurely awoken again, this time from a dare by the Daredevilfish Club, which results in his hypnotizing the members of the club and manipulating Ariel into stealing the [[Trident (The Little Mermaid)|trident]] as a \"dare\". He intends to use the trident as revenge towards the Atlanticans for waking him up. Ariel manages to avert the disaster upon realizing what happened, and proceeds to sing him a lullaby, causing him to return to his crevasse to go back to sleep. The issue implies that this event takes place some time after the events of Sea Calliope.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\ncalliopedreams42.jpg\nSeaClops 004.jpg\nSeaClops 012.jpg\nSeaClops 003.jpg\nSeaClops 006.jpg\nSeaClops 011.jpg\ncalliopedreams97.jpg\nSeaClops 002.jpg\nSeaClops 009.jpg\nSeaClops 007.jpg\nSeaClops 008.jpg\nSeaClops 001.jpg\nSeaClops 005.jpg\ncalliopedreams148.jpg\ncalliopedreams150.jpg\ncalliopedreams153.jpg\ncalliopedreams160.jpg\nSeaClops 010.jpg\ncalliopedreams166.jpg\nSeaClops 013.jpg\ncalliopedreams171.jpg|The Seaclops lulled back to sleep.\ncalliopedreams174.jpg\ncalliopedreams175.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Little Mermaid}}\n[[Category:The Little Mermaid characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Sea Monsters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
