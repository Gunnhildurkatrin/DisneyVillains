He is the last surviving member of a race of Mukhtars, otherwise known as Genie hunters and therefore was originally [[Genie]]'s enemy until he later reformed and they became allies.\n\n==Role in the series==\nThe Mukhtar appears in two episodes, \"[[Genie Hunt]]\" and \"[[The Hunted (Aladdin)|The Hunted]]\". In the former of these, he is hired for one of [[Genie]]'s former masters, [[Ajed Al-Gebraic]], to capture Genie and put him into his service again. In the latter, he is hired by [[Mozenrath]] to capture Genie so he can entrap him in the [[Crystal of Ix]] and steal his powers, but ends up turning on Mozenrath and helping [[Aladdin (character)|Aladdin]] rescue Genie after he saves him from a giant monstrous killer plant inside Mozenrath's palace. At the end of the episode, Genie and the Mukhtar part as friends.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n{{Aladdin}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mukhtar, The}}\n[[Category:Aladdin characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Hunters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-villains]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]"
