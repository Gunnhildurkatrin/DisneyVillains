She speaks fluently in Spanish and has a Latin-American accent.\n\nRosita was one of the [[Showgirl Birds|showgirl birds]] in the [[Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room|Enchanted Tiki]] Room but came to leave the group for her own aspirations.  She came to be something of a freelance performing artist, often relying on the [[Jungle Navigation Company]] to assist her in her travels.\n\n==Disney Parks==\n\n=== [[Adventure Trading Company]] ===\nThe Daily Gnus newspaper made to tie into the Adventure Trading Company has a community message reading, \"Missing Bird - White Cockatoo answers to Rosita\".\n\n===[[Big Thunder Mountain Railroad]]===\nA large bird cage was added to the air-testing area of [[Big Thunder Mountain Railroad]]'s queue in [[Walt Disney World]].  Said large bird cage is empty but has, \"Rosita\" written on it as a reference to the Tiki Room bird.\n\n===[[Jungle Cruise]]===\nDue to her placement in the Tropical Hideaway, Rosita is very blatantly visible from the Jungle Cruise and sometimes turns to face guests on the ride.  Skippers on the attraction may also have dialogue regarding Rosita.  Rosita is visibly suspended from her Jungle Navigation Co. crane in a net holding all of her luggage.\n\n===[[Skipper Canteen]]===\nA letter addressed to Rosita can be found within the Skipper Canteen, pinned to a bulletin board.  The addressing on the letter shows that she was believed to be living in the Tiki Room at the time only for the letter to be returned to sender due to Rosita apparently being gone.\n\n===[[Trader Sam's]]===\n\n==== Trader Sam's Enchanted Tiki Bar ====\nA letter to [[Trader Sam]] from Jos\u00e9 asks him if he knows where Rosita is due to the Tiki Room birds holding a bet on the outcome.\n\n==== Trader Sam's Grog Grotto ====\nIn Trader Sam's Grog Grotto in [[Disney's Polynesian Village Resort]] there is a mobile made of clams where one of the clams has, \"Rosita\" written on it.  This being an allusion to Rosita's name on the bird-mobile in the Enchanted Tiki Room.\n\n===[[The Tropical Hideaway]]===\nRosita made her first physical appearance in the Tropical Hideaway restaurant which opened in 2018; a restaurant serving as a sort of melting pot between the [[Jungle Cruise]], Tiki Room and [[Society of Explorers and Adventurers|''S.E.A.'']].  She is portrayed via audio-animatronic which mingles with guests by explaining her story, cracking jokes and having musical moments. Her singing is made to emulate the tiki room while her jokes are intended to channel the Jungle Cruise, feeding into the story of the restaurant.\n\nRosita is seen resting on luggage, tiki artifacts, and a crate of birdseed along the riverside of the Jungle Cruise.  Here she cracks jokes and whistles for guests as she waits for a Jungle Navigation Co. boat she has scheduled.\n\n===[[Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room]]===\nA perch for Rosita can be seen with her name on it in the bird-mobile of the Enchanted Tiki Room, however it is empty.  During the musical number [[Let's All Sing Like the Birdies Sing|''Let's All Sing like the Birdies Sing'']], the bird [[Jos\u00e9]] mentions, \"I wonder what happened to Rosita\".\n\n== Other appearances ==\n\n===[[Jungle Cruise (film)|Jungle Cruise]] ===\nRosita appears in this film as the pet of [[Nilo Nemolato]] in 1916, though she seemingly lacks her apparent human-level intelligence from the parks.  She is portrayed in this film usually saying \"Frank owes me money\", the only line she says repeatedly throughout the film.\n\n==Trivia==\n*By Rosita's side in the Tropical Hideaway are a barker-hat and a crane.  These are an allusion to the barker bird [[Juan the Barker Bird|Juan]] who used to be perched outside of the Enchanted Tiki Room.\n*Originally, a pet monkey was planned for Nemolato's pet, but this was opted out for a bird due to monkeys being difficult to work with.\n\n== External links ==\n\n*''[https://junglecruise.fandom.com/wiki/Rosita Rosita]'' on the ''[https://junglecruise.fandom.com/wiki/Jungle_Cruise_Wiki Jungle Cruise Wiki]''.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:RositaConcept.webp|Concept art for the Tropical Hideaway\nFile:Nilo-Nemolato.webp|Rosita in the film\n</gallery><br />{{Society of Explorers and Adventurers}}\n\n{{Enchanted Tiki Room}}\n{{Jungle Cruise}}\n{{Big Thunder Mountain Railroad}}\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Enchanted Tiki Room characters]]\n[[Category:Birds]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]\n[[Category:Jungle Cruise characters]]\n[[Category:Big Thunder Mountain Railroad Characters]]\n[[Category:S.E.A. characters]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]"
