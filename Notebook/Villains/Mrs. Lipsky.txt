She is voiced by [[Estelle Harris]]\n\n==History==\nMrs. Lipsky is the mother of [[Dr. Drakken]], or - as she calls him - Drewbie. She believes her son is a radio talk show doctor who spends his time helping people with their problems. Drakken is unwilling to tell her the truth about his profession, preferring that she should just find out when he actually takes over the world. She is very affectionate toward her son, who is, in turn, clearly very fond of her (if occasionally embarrassed by the way she tends to treat him). She seems to want him to get married soon, and also thinks [[Shego]] is his girlfriend.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nDrakken_and_his_Mother.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Kim Possible}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lipsky}}\n[[Category:Kim Possible characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Aunts]]"
