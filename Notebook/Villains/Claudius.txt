He became a gladiator champion due to winning many battles against other lions.\n\n===Personality===\nClaudius is a mean and vicious lion. According to [[Quint]], he is a bloodthirsty, undefeated, and gladiating lion who has never lost a fight in his life. He is also one of the few characters who doesn't have any spoken dialogue \u2013 because of this not much is known about his personality.\n\n===Physical Description===\nClaudius is a large, broad-shouldered, and powerfully built lion. He has brown fur, with a dark mane, gray claws, and a cream chest, muzzle, and paws. His eyes are black.\n\n==Role in the series==\nWhen [[Timon]], [[Pumbaa]], and [[Simba]] run into each other after being captured and taken to the Roman Colosseum, they plan to leave the arena. However, they are stopped by Colosseum Quintius, who tries to force Simba to eat Timon and Pumbaa, or else he would have to fight Claudius.\n\nIn order to avoid getting eaten by Simba or else having their friend die in a battle, Timon hatches a plan to make it ''seem'' like Simba is eating them. The plan, however, backfires, as Simba is forced to spit his friends out of his mouth after Pumbaa inadvertently passes gas.\n\nExposed for their trickery, Timon, Pumbaa, and Simba beat a hasty retreat and manage to escape the Colosseum, with Quint in pursuit. After a long chase that culminated in both groups using chariots, the trio manage to leave Quint behind. Timon, Pumbaa, and Simba then try to find a way out of Rome. Before they could, Quint captures Simba and prepares for him to fight Claudius to the death the next day.\n\nUnable to free Simba from his imprisonment, Timon and Pumbaa devise a plan to make Claudius forfeit his fight with Simba instead. Later that night, while visiting the lion's den, both Timon and Pumbaa come up with various ways to make their plan work, such as asking favors, blackmailing, and teeth extraction, all of which end in failure.\n\nThe next day, Simba and Claudius enter the Colosseum. Just as both lions are gearing up to fight, Claudius falls asleep, much to the audience's surprise and frustration. It is then revealed that while Timon and Pumbaa had not been able to get Claudius to forfeit the fight, their attempts to make him forfeit had kept him awake all night. Enraged that Claudius would not fight and that Simba still refuses to eat Timon and Pumbaa, Quint decides to fight the trio himself.\n\n==Trivia==\n*His name comes from {{WikipediaLink|King Claudius}}, who is the inspiration for [[Scar]].\n**Additionally, he does share a similar apperance to Scar, though more muscular and even having a slightly larger mane.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nRaClaudius2.png|Claudius roaring\nRaClaudius3.png|Timon removing a thorn from Claudius' paw\nRaClaudius.png\nRaClaudius4.png|Timon and Pumbaa try to feed Claudius a salad\nRaClaudius5.png|Claudius about to get a teeth extraction\nRaClaudius6.png|Claudius getting out of his cage to fight Simba\nClaudiusPrepared.png|Claudius prepares to fight Simba\nRaClaudius7.png|Claudius falls asleep\n</gallery> \u00a0\n\n{{TheLionKingWiki}}\n{{The Lion King}}\n[[Category:Lions]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:African characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Timon & Pumbaa characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]"
