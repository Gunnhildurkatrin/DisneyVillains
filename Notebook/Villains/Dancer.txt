He along with [[Dasher]] serves as lead reindeer on Santa Claus's sleigh team.\n\nHe is voiced by [[David DeLuise]].\n\n==Background==\n===Official Bio===\n'''Occupation''':\nLead Reindeer, Santa's Sleigh Team\n\n'''Call Sign:'''\n8 Maids-a-Milking\n\n'''Favorite Christmas Tradition''':\nDancer enjoys buying new ornaments at the Holiday Craft Fair and hanging them from his antlers at the annual Christmas Party.\n\nDancer is one of the legendary eight reindeer who pull Santa's sleigh every Christmas Eve. Dancer is the lead reindeer along with his counterpart, Dasher, whose bravado Dancer admires. Dancer does his best to project a brave fa\u00e7ade like Dasher, but he tends to fold like a lawn chair under pressure.\n\n'''Likes''':\nDancer tries never to miss his favorite soap opera, As the Yule Log Burns. He is also a huge fan of famed North Pole singer, Harold Angel, and has all of his albums with the exception of The Whiteout album, which to this day is an extremely sore subject.\n\n'''Dislikes''':\nDancer has a tendency to put on a few pounds during the summer months, which is a constant source of frustration for him. Dr. Autry, the Reindeer Trainer & Nutritionist, tries to remedy his weight gain with slimming Tundra Grass Milkshakes and a stringent weightlifting regimen.\n\n'''Random Fact''':\nEvery year when Dancer sheds his antlers, he still enjoys putting them under his pillow awaiting a visit from the Antler Fairy.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Prep & Landing]]''===\nDancer is first seen with Dasher and the rest of the sleigh team preparing to guide Santa's sleigh on Christmas Eve. The team are later contacted by [[Magee]] as they travel during a snowstorm.\n\nAfter Santa is told to skip Timmy's house (due to it not being prepared), Dancer and the rest of the sleigh team turn and go a different direction. However, [[Wayne]] manages to contact Santa and convince him to come back to Timmy's house and thus, the team turn back around and manage to land on the roof, but nearly fall off, taking the sleigh with them. Luckily, Wayne and his partner [[Lanny]] are able to help in time.\n\nDancer is last seen with Dasher and the rest of the Santa's elves celebrating at a party.\n\n==External links==\n*[[w:c:prepandlanding:{{PAGENAME}}|Prep & Landing Wiki: {{PAGENAME}}]]\n\n{{Prep & Landing}}\n[[Category:Prep & Landing characters]]\n[[Category:Deer]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
