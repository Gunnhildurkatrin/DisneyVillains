She first appears in the episode, \"[[Daytrip of Doom!]]\" and she also is a waitress at Funso's Fun Zone.\n\n==Role in the series==\nJane first appears in the series premiere, \"[[Daytrip of Doom!]]\". Here, she works at the Pizza Pier at Funso's, where Louie persuades Jane to getting free tokens and free drinks. Webby is horrified, but Louie asks her to try out his methods. Webby fails this due to her integrity and poor lying skills, which gets her, Webby and Louie in trouble with the manager.\n\nIn \"[[Louie's Eleven!]]\", Jane is Louie's eighth guest as part of Louie's plan to be on Emma Glamour's IT list to which she receives contact from Louie. Jane not only works at Funso's but also works at the Duckburg Museum at [[Daisy Duck|Daisy]]'s party. When Daisy approaches her, she accidentally spills water on her dress, much to her disgust and Emma Glamour preventing her Daisy from blaming the server. Jane walks downstairs just as Louie gives her a coin while instructing Donald to get the stage pass.\n\nIn \"[[The Last Adventure!]]\" while at Funso's, Webby asks Jane for water to which she ends up getting Pep! instead from the soda fountain during Webby's birthday. She only appears in \"Part 1: A Tale of Three Webbys\".\n\n== Trivia ==\n*A minor gag is when the characters ask Jane for water to which she agrees, the characters end up getting a different drink instead of water.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nThe Last Adventure.png\n</gallery>\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{DuckTales}}\n[[Category:DuckTales characters]]\n[[Category:Eagles]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
