'''Experiment 202''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]]. He\u00a0is designed to use his high-pitched shriek to jam radar.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Stitch! The Movie]]''===\nExperiment 202 was the 202nd genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. Hamsterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to jam radar with his high-pitched shriek. 202 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai, with 202's pod landing on a cliff face by a waterfall.\n\nLater, 202's pod was accidentally moved by a frog off the ledge and into the waterfall, activating the experiment, which then flew off to cause trouble.\n\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nAt an unknown point after this, Experiment\u00a0202 was presumably captured and named Jam.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nThe first 624 experiments, including Jam, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]] and [[Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nJam participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]].\n\nThe Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Jam is Experiment 202. However, in ''[[Stitch! The Movie]]'', his [[Experiment Pods|pod]] is labeled 455, a number taken by [[Mary (Lilo & Stitch)|Mary]], most likely due to Jumba's untidy [[Jumba's Computer|database]].\n*Jam and [[Snooty]]\u00a0are the only known experiments based on bats. Interestingly, they are both in the 2-series and purple. Additionally, they both share the same voice actor, [[Frank Welker]].\n*Jam's pod\u00a0color is red.\n*Jam's wings appear in the online game ''[[Jumba's Lab]]''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nStitch-the-movie-ad-wallpaper.jpg\nStitch-experiments and ohana.jpg\nscreenCapture 07.07.13 19-01-49.jpg|Jam's experiment pod\nscreenCapture 07.07.13 19-18-41.jpg\nscreenCapture 07.07.13 19-24-42.jpg\nVlcsnap-2013-02-08-11h58m00s88.png\nVlcsnap-2013-03-30-19h48m20s74.png\nVlcsnap-2013-04-03-21h44m19s45.png\nVlcsnap-2013-07-07-22h51m43s20.png\nVlcsnap-2013-07-07-22h58m23s166.png\nVlcsnap-2013-02-08-11h59m38s131.png\nVlcsnap-2013-05-21-14h09m47s96.png\nVlcsnap-2013-06-13-14h04m04s77.png\nvlcsnap-2012-08-02-19h09m34s44.png\nvlcsnap-2013-02-08-12h03m49s61.png\nVlcsnap-2012-07-03-21h38m44s14.png\nScreenCapture 17.06.13 19-48-30.jpg\nScreenCapture 03.04.13 14-16-57.jpg\nVlcsnap-2012-07-03-22h16m18s43.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Bats]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-villains]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]"
