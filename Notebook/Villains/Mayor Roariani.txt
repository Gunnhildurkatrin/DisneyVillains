She appears in the episode \"[[Roarsville Rules]]\".\n\nShe first appears at the podium in Roarsville, making her speech about becoming the city's new mayor (Swifty Hugglemonster was the previous mayor). Just as Roariani was about to read from the rule book, Captain Hollander arrived to take her to the monster mayor's meeting in Growlsburg. Roariani left someone else in charge until she returned. Everyone agreed to put [[Henry Hugglemonster (character)|Henry]] in charge of the rules.\n\nWhen Mayor Roariani returned from the meeting, she arrived to find Roarsville in a mess. Henry explained how hard it was to be a mayor and how everyone had trouble with the rules. Everyone volunteered to restore the city to the way it was, but Roariani allowed them to keep the hugglejuice fountain [[Cobby Hugglemonster|Cobby]] had built earlier. She later shared a cup of hugglejuice along with Henry.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nMayor Roariani speech.jpg\nMayor Roariani rulebook.jpg\nMayor Roariani that's me.jpg\nMayor Roariani catch ride.jpg\nMayor Roariani return.jpg\nMayor Roariani what happened.jpg\nMayor Roariani clean up.jpg\nMayor Roariani rulebook makeover.jpg\nHenry and the Mayor.jpg\nHuggle Bubble photo op.png\n</gallery>\n\n==External link==\n*[[w:c:Henry Hugglemonster:Mayor Roariani|Mayor Roariani]] on [[w:c:Henry Hugglemonster:Mayor Roariani|Henry Hugglemonster Wiki]]\n\n{{Henry Hugglemonster}}\n[[Category:Henry Hugglemonster characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Mayors]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Politicians]]"
