He was voiced by [[Kel Mitchell]].\n\n==Personality==\nAn artist at heart, Dutch's creativity and tech knowledge made him a shoe-in as the Burners' go-to mechanic and his loyalty made him a steadfast teammate. While Dutch may value his alone time to pursue his artistic passions, he is always ready to upgrade the Burners' hot rods with one of his latest weapons or gadgetry, with the help of his robot assistant, [[R.O.T.H.]].\n\n==Appearance==\nDutch is the tallest of the Burners by far. He is African American and wears his hair in an afro style. He wears a purple and yellow t-shirt with his Burner logo on the chest, dark green pants, and brown shoes.

Wishing to continue his interest of art without endangering himself and his family, Dutch moved to a place with much less law than Detroit Deluxe, Motorcity. There, he met Mike Chilton and was offered a position in the Burners, which he accepted.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Dutch is the tallest Burner.\n*Dutch's family still lives in [[Detroit Deluxe]].
