Mabel quickly wins him over with a paper fortune teller and tells him his wife will be pretty, but he worries if she will love him.\n\nHe later appears in \"[[Summerween]]\", where [[Dipper Pines|Dipper]] and Mabel's costume and dance bring him to tears and gives the two generous helpings of candy.\n\n==Personality==\nThe Bats Biker may look gruff and mean, but he appears to have a soft spot for cute things.\n\n==Appearance==\nBats Biker has a grizzled face with a bushy black beard, sideburns, and eyebrows. He appears to be missing teeth, has pierced ears and a scar on the side of his face. He wears a red bandana and is possibly bald. He also has a tattoo on his right arm of a dagger with a banner over it that reads \"BATS\" which is \"STAB\" backward. He wears a black shirt that is ripped on the side arms. The tattoo read backward says stab, this makes sense because behind the wording is a knife.\n\n{{GFWiki}}\n{{Gravity Falls}}\n[[Category:Gravity Falls characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
