She is the biggest reporter in [[Big City]] that is always trying to get the big scoop.\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nMaria Media is a tough and determined woman for Channel 11 News who is always trying to get to the bottom of a good story. Like a stereotypical reporter, she speaks with authority and urgency. She apparently thinks highly of herself and her abilities and is always trying to make a moment look right for the cameras such as when she had [[Gramma Alice]] removed from the shot because she wanted a \"friendlier gramma\". Maria seems mostly concerned with what looks presentable such as having Big City accuse Tilly of \"ruining Christmas\", or showing more focus on Cricket and his dancing rather than Bill's prized watermelon.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nMaria Media is a tall reddish-orange skinned woman with neat red hair. She wears a light blue jacket with a white collar, a black shirt underneath and dark blue pants with black shoes.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Maria Media's name, pronounced like \"Madea\", is clearly a play on the actual word \"Media\" which has to do with her job.\n**Her name could also be a reference to the Tyler Perry character Madea.\n**Based on this pronunciation and her voice actress, she can be assumed to be African-American.\n**The alliteration might also be a reference to Lois Lane, a reporter from DC Comics and Superman's love interest.\n\n==External links==\n*{{Interwiki|https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/countryclub9732/images/6/64/Favicon.ico|bigcitygreens|Maria Media|Big City Greens Wiki}}\n\n{{Big City Greens}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Big City Greens characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:News Reporters]]"
