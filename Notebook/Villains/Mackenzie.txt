It can't even rent it for a while. Mackenzie has tons of money ... and still is not happy. Is it the pressure of running his family's water business? Is it the tension between him and his half brother [[Devon]]? Is it the girls in his life tugging him in emotionally different directions? Does it matter? The point is... he is not happy.\n\n==Personality==\nMackenzie is the run-of-the-mill dream guy who is apparently adept at everything. He is an excellent student, getting straight A+s on his grades, while managing his family's water business.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nMacchloe.JPG\nScreen Shot 2016-09-09 at 4.06.08 PM.png|\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Mackenzie Falls}}\n[[Category:Sonny with a Chance Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Mackenzie Falls]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
