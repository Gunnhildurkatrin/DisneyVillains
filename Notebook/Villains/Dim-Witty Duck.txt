In fact, he is very much a duck version of [[Goofy]]. An occasional sidekick of [[Donald Duck]]'s, his role seemed to mirror that of Goofy to [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]]. Later he signed on as [[Moby Duck]]'s ship hand, serving pretty much the same Goofy-like role. It is unclear whether he is a member of the extended Duck Family. He made his first comic appearance in the comic story \"The Vanishing Banister\" (''Walt Disney's Comics & Stories'' #330, March 1968). Unlike Moby Duck, he has not made an animated appearance on film or TV.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nDimWittyFirst.jpg\nDimWittyFirstAppearance.jpg\nMoby Duck and Dimwitty.jpg\nMobyDuckDimwitty.jpg\nDimWitty.png\n1693415762.jpg\n985081-pimba2 large.jpg\nDimWitty.gif\nDim_witty_duck_with_moby_duck_2020.jpg \n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*{{Inducks character|Dimwitty}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Duck, Dim-Witty}}\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Sailors]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]"
