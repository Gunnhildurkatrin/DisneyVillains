In these stories, Br'er Gator traditionally served as an antagonist and enemy to the archetypal trickster-hero of Br'er Rabbit.\n\nIn one of these stories, Br'er Gator attempted to eat Br'er Rabbit only for the rabbit to trick him into lying in a fire which caused his back to grow course.  In another story, Br'er Rabbit used fake rumours to make the gator insecure enough to agree to ferry Br'er Rabbit across the river for free.\n\nBr'er Gator was adapted into AA form for the attraction Splash Mountain, a ride based on the Uncle Remus stories.  In [[2020]], the attraction was slated to be removed due to its [[Song of the South|long history of systemic racism]].\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n=== Splash Mountain ===\nBr'er Gator appeared twice in Splash Mountain, first during the \u00a0''[[How Do You Do?]]'' musical number.  Br'er Gator was seen fishing in the waters of Splash Mountain as [[Br'er Frog]] casually laid on his back.  The gator was seen again near the end of the ride, sticking his head out of the water to bite the tail of [[Br'er Fox]].  As the fox attempted to tug [[Br'er Bear]] out from the briar patch, Br'er Gator attempted to drag the fox underwater to eat much to Br'er Fox's dismay.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Br'er Gator from the ride has received online popularity due to the spreading interest in  ''submechanophobia'', the irrational fear of mechanical objects (namely animatronics) submerged in water.  \n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\n11320810723 906bf7c162 m.jpg\n3108980605 7ab048c0e4.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Song of the South}}\n\n[[Category:Splash Mountain characters]]\n[[Category:Alligators]]\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]"
