They aren't overall that trusting of the Big Kids (older students).\n\nThey make up their own unique group among the students. The kindergartners live as uncivilized, wild, and dangerous little urchins who wear face paint, carry tribal weapons, harass the older children and have even attempted to cannibalistically eat them (as seen in the first and other episodes).\n\nSeveral notable kindergartners include Hector, [[Tubby]], Jake, Zedd, [[Gilbert]], Emma, Spencer, Cindy, and [[The Brittanys|the Brittanys]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nCheif Stinky.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Recess}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kindergartners, The}}\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Recess characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]"
