He is an elderly griffin who lives at the Elysian Sunset Rest Home in Room XXIII (23). His one appearance was the episode \"[[Hercules and the Griffin]]\".\nMr. Griff was tasked ages ago with guarding the first diamond crafted by [[Hephaestus]]. Griff's greatest foe was King Arismap, the leader of the band of thieving mountain gnomes known as the Arismapse. Always did King Arismap and his cronies attempt to make off with the gemstone, but Griff always managed to foil them. Of course, Arismap was not one to give up so easily. Because of this, Griff refused to ever leave his nest, which is why it was brought along with him when he entered his winter years.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nMr. Griff and Hephaestus.png|Mr. Griff given the duty of guarding the first diamond.\nHercnGryphon 365.png\nHercnGryphon 573.png\nHercnGryphon 626.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Hercules}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Griff, Mr.}}\n[[Category:Hercules characters]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Mystical animals]]\n[[Category:Greek characters]]\n[[Category:Griffins]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
