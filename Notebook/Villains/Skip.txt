'''Experiment 089''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo & Stitch'' franchise]].\u00a0He is designed to skip time by ten minutes, but had a flaw in his programming that made him skip ahead\u00a0ten years instead. When used by someone, it will actually seem as if that person disappeared for one decade. Luckily, he has a reset button that will bring the time traveler back to the original time they started in.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nRather than being a troublesome experiment, Skip is rather wobbly and clumsy and enjoys exploring his surroundings. He is also surprisingly happy-go-lucky and easygoing, often smiling and not caring about being confined. Unlike most of his cousins, he doesn't cause trouble on purpose but tends to cause unforeseen consequences when someone activates his powers. He seems slightly dazed at times, not paying attention to what others are saying and not being observant of his surroundings.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nSkip is a plump, purple hourglass-shaped experiment with a large head, on top of which is two green dots forming the button to activate his power. He has small white eyes with black pupils, a red nose, and a wide mouth.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nSkip can transport himself and anyone near him ten years into the future each time his button is pressed; they will also age ten years with each \"skip\". However, the people who travel with him will be absent during the ten years skipped. Luckily, Skip also has a reverse setting that sends him and his user back to the present day by pressing his button while he's upside down.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment 089 was the 89th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Jacques von H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was originally designed to skip time by ten minutes (because Jumba was too impatient to wait for his microwave to reheat his leftovers), but there was an error in his program; when the button on 089's head was pressed, he instead skipped ahead ten years. 089 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.\n\nAt an unknown point, Experiment 089 was activated and then taken in by the [[Aloha Animal Rescue|dog shelter]].\n\nWhen [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]]\u00a0went to visit the pound and asked the [[Susan Hegarty|dog pound lady]] if there had been any new \"dogs\" brought here lately, she presented 089 to Lilo. 089 was then adopted from the dog shelter by Lilo and named Skip.\n\nAfter [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]]\u00a0explained Skip's powers, Lilo, who became tired of childhood restrictions, used the experiment to skip her and [[Stitch]] ahead ten years and become a teenager.\n\nWhen Lilo\u00a0discovered that\u00a0adolescence was much more difficult than childhood, she used Skip to flash forward another ten years and become a full-fledged adult.\n\nHowever, Lilo, Stitch, and Skip were sent into an alternate future ruled by [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]. Lilo was puzzled by this setback, but before she could investigate further, Stitch and Skip were captured by [[Clink]] and taken to [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]], despite Lilo's best efforts to protect them.\n\nWhen Lilo returned\u00a0[[Lilo's House|home]], a tattered Jumba explained that while she and Stitch had been gone for 20 years, their house was repossessed to cover unpaid parking tickets regarding [[Nani Pelekai|Nani]]'s [[X-Buggy|dune buggy]] that Lilo borrowed as a teen ten years from the current day. Unfortunately, Nani had to work for H\u00e4msterviel to pay off any debts.\n\nLater on, Stitch and Skip were rescued by Lilo, Jumba, and [[Pleakley]] while Gantu was distracted. Lilo then used Skip's reverse function, which Jumba revealed, to return her and Stitch to the present. After this experience, Lilo realized that being a child actually had its advantages.\n\n===''[[The Origin of Stitch]]''===\nSkip was one of the experiments that were gliding on the screen, but he is 531 instead of 089.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nThe first 624 experiments, including Skip, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]] and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nSkip did not participate in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]], instead choosing to retreat with the weaker experiments.\n\nThe Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n==Trivia==\n*Skip was activated off-screen.\n*Skip is one of the rare experiments to have sclerae and pupils instead of solid black eyes, the others being [[Mr. Stenchy]], [[Mrs. Sickly]], [[Clink]], [[Nosox]], and [[Bragg]].\n*Skip is one of the few experiments to not appear in the group photo at the end of ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''.\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
