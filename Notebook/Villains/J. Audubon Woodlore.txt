Audubon Woodlore''' is a fussy, but crafty and knowledgeable park ranger of Brownstone National Park. He most prominently serves as a foil to the mischievous [[Humphrey the Bear]].\n\n==Background==\nJ. Audubon Woodlore first appeared in the [[1954]] Donald Duck short,\u00a0''[[Grin and Bear It]]'', and then again in\u00a0''[[Grand Canyonscope]]''\u00a0(also in\u00a01954).\u00a0A year later, he was in the short, ''[[Beezy Bear]]''. J. Audubon Woodlore is usually seen performing duties\u00a0related to running to Brownstone National Park. His foil is usually [[Humphrey the Bear]]. In one cartoon, he is seen regulating fishing season. During the short, Woodlore serves in keeping the lakes stocked, and making sure that everyone follows the laws. At the end, he opens hunting season, much to the chagrin of Humphrey. In another, he realizes that the park was become covered in litter. He starts to pick up the litter himself, but then realizes that since he is the boss, he can makes someone else do it. He then makes the bears perform a cleanup of the piles of litter that are in the park, bribing them with the prospect of chicken cacciatore.\n\nIn other cartoons, he interacts with [[Donald Duck]]. At one point, Donald runs a honey farm next door to the park. Ranger Woodlore is seen trying to keep the bears (mainly Humphrey) from raiding the hives. In another cartoon, he serves as a tour guide at the [[Grand Canyon]]. When Donald and [[Louie the Mountain Lion|a runaway mountain lion]] destroy the canyon, Woodlore forces the two to start digging in an attempt to repair the canyon.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]''===\nThe ranger reprises his role with Humphrey in the animated series. Like the classic cartoons, Woodlore struggles to keep Brownstone in check but is proven difficult due to Humphrey.\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\n[[File:53.PNG|thumb|left|250px|Woodlore in ''House of Mouse'']]\nWoodlore reappears as a cameo guest in ''House of Mouse''. In one specific episode \"[[Humphrey in the House]]\", Woodlore was hired by [[Minnie Mouse]] to clean the [[House of Mouse (night club)|club]] as the [[Magic Brooms]] were on vacation. During the work, Woodlore would attempt to keep Humphrey at bay, who tries to steal as much food as possible. Woodlore also appears in ''[[Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse]]''. He is also mentioned by [[Ludwig Von Drake]] in \"[[The Ludwig Von Drake Song]]\", as he lists the various Disney guests at the club.\n\n===Other appearances===\nIn ''[[Mickey Mouse Club]]'', Woodlore was part of Mickey's band in the opening animated theme. He was the lead drummer and marched in front of Humphrey and the other bears.\n\nIn ''[[Ralph Breaks the Internet]]'', Ranger Woodlore, and Humphrey appear as custodians in [[Oh My Disney]], seen picking up trash during [[Vanellope von Schweetz]]'s visit.\n\n==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==\n===[[Disneyland]]===\nJ. Audubon Woodlore made his Disney Parks debut in [[Disneyland]] as a face character. In one of the shows, he teaches park guests about keeping the forest clean.\n\nIf you look carefully during the [[Country Bear Vacation Hoedown]] on the screen during Wendell's song, J. Audubon Woodlore is on one of the pictures pointing at the \"Don't Feed the Bears\" sign.\n\nAs part of a 2019 refurbishment, the safety spiels at [[Grizzly River Run]] at Disney California Adventure were redone with Woodlore's voice, replacing the original \"extreme sports\" voice. Ranger Woodlore can also be seen on an interactive fire danger sign at [[Redwood Creek Challenge Trail]].\n\nIn [[Mickey's\u00a0Toontown|Mickey's&nbsp;Toontown]], one of the unenterable shop windows has Woodlore's name on it.\n\n===[[Walt Disney World]]===\nAlong with Humphrey, Woodlore is a mascot for [[Walt Disney World|Walt Disney World's]] Disney's Wilderness Lodge Hotel. The ranger appears in the hotel's merchandise as well.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*According to ''Grand Canyonscope'', Woodlore worked in postal service prior to becoming a national park ranger.\n\n{{Mickey Mouse & Friends}}\n{{Mickey Mouse Works}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Woodlore, J.
