He has all but memorized every episode of the canine's TV show. When Bolt shows up at his door, Rhino sallies forth in his hamster ball to help him out.\n\nThough perhaps not the brightest of characters, Rhino does manage to help Bolt and [[Mittens]]\u00a0at times. Other than that, Rhino's function in the movie is more that of a \"comic relief\", offering little character development and personality, but quite a few humorous dialogues.\n\nRhino was also the central protagonist of his own short, ''[[Super Rhino]]'', in which he got superpowers himself by Penny's father (just like Bolt). The short feature was added to the Blu-ray and DVD release.\n\n==Role in the film==\nRhino is a hamster that [[Bolt (character)|Bolt]] and [[Mittens]] meet while they are trying to get food. He watches all of Bolt's episodes on television and claims himself to be Bolt's number one fan. Though he was at first living with an older woman in a trailer park among many other hamsters, he decides to join Bolt in his journey to find [[Penny (Bolt)|Penny]].\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n* Rhino is known to break the fourth wall.\n*Rhino claims that his ancestry is also comprised of wolf (1/16th) and wolverine.\n* Originally, Rhino's voice actor\u00a0[[Mark Walton]]\u00a0was a\u00a0placeholder voice, but the producers loved Walton's take on the character so much that he became the official voice.\n* He is the only character in the first film who never realized [[Bolt (character)|Bolt]]'s superpowers were not real, with Bolt seemingly seeing it unnecessary to tell the truth. However, in the ending, he watches the ''Bolt'' TV show and deems it unrealistic,\u00a0implying that he learned of the truth after being adopted by [[Penny (Bolt)|Penny]].\n*In one scene, one of the TV show's actors who plays one of Dr. Calico's henchmen that begins to adore Rhino when the latter \"attacks\" his leg reveals that he used to have a hamster similar to Rhino during childhood named \"Mr. Sparkles\".\n* It was implied in the first film that Bolt's relation to Rhino changed as the dog realized he did not have any superpowers. At first, Bolt was amazed with Rhino's lively,\u00a0energetic character. However, his simplistic, pedestrian view of himself and the world soon became a nuisance, and after Bolt's quarrel with [[Mittens]], he decides to travel on without Rhino, leaving him behind in Las Vegas.\n* Rhino was listed #40 in Empire Magazine's The 50 Best Animated Movie Characters.\n*The animators brought a giant inflatable hamster ball into the studio to correctly replicate it within the film  \n\n==External links==\n* [http://disney.go.com/characters/#/characters/animated/bios/rhino/ Rhino's bio on Disney.com]\n\n{{Bolt}}\n[[fr:Rhino]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Bolt characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Hamsters]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Tritagonists]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]\n[[Category:Empire 50 Best Animated Characters]]"
