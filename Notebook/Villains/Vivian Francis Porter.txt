Fenn reported the robot as his stolen property in order to hide his own failures in robotics. In the end, she is offered a job at the Middleton Space Center by [[Dr. James Possible|Dr. James Timothy Possible]], which she happily accepted.\n\n==Skills==\n\ufeffVivian is a very intelligent woman, who has designed robots for the Middleton Space Center. These robots were equipped with advanced technology, such as artificial intelligence (the robot learning as it goes) and self-preservation (sensing danger and defending itself\ufeff). It can be assumed that she turned out to be an asset to the Middleton Space Center when Dr. Fen was arrested.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\">\nVivian Francis Porter.jpg\nVivian.jpg\n</gallery>\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Porter, Vivian Francis}}{{Kim Possible}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Kim Possible characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
