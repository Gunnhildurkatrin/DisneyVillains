He\u00a0stops Peter from going off to find the dastardly wolf with his popgun, scolds and spanks him, and tells him that if he tries to go after it, he could very well end up getting eaten. To scare him further, he makes a wolf's evil fangs with his beard to show him the shadow puppet of the wolf on the wall. Peter turns around and tries to shoot it, but tricking him, he easily grabs Peter's cap and popgun from him and storms off. However, when he falls asleep in\u00a0his chair by the fireplace, Peter manages to get his things back and sneak outside.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the children's book based on the segment, it is revealed that after Peter returns, having successfully captured the wolf, Grandpa is pleased with him and glad to see him safe, despite his disobedience. Peter also promises to listen to and never disobey Grandpa again.\n*Grandpa is represented in the music by a bassoon.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nmakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps_com-2514.jpg|Grandpa catching Peter and scolds him\nmakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps_com-2518.jpg|Grandpa spanking Peter\nmakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps_com-2523.jpg\nmakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps_com-2533.jpg\nmakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps_com-2537.jpg\nmakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps_com-2541.jpg\nmakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps_com-2544.jpg\nmakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps_com-2550.jpg\nmakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps_com-2554.jpg\nmakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps_com-2592.jpg\nmakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps_com-2599.jpg\nmakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps_com-2601.jpg\nmakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps_com-2608.jpg\nmakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps_com-2613.jpg\nmakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps_com-2618.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Make Mine Music}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Make Mine Music characters]]\n[[Category:Hunters]]\n[[Category:Russian characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Grandparents]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Peter and the Wolf]]"
