But when she accidentally tosses her Serge Sanchez bag into a fountain, this princess comes face-to-face with her own personal frog, self-professed film geek [[Josh Rosen]].\nIn return for rescuing Dylan's bag, Josh convinces Dylan to let him film her for his documentary on high school popularity. Reluctantly, Dylan lets F-list Josh into her A-list world, and is shocked to realize that sometimes nerds can be pretty cool.\n\nDuring the film-making, she is pretty rough on him, but soon they become super close. After being dumped by [[Asher Dumetz]], she starts to like Josh and they kiss and date at Spring Formal.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nJylan.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Schoenfield, Dylan}}\n[[Category:Geek Charming Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
