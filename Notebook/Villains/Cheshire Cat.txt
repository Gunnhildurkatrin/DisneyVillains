Aha... HAHAHAHAHA! You may have noticed that I'm not all there myself.|Cheshire Cat|Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)}}\nThe '''Cheshire Cat''' is a major character in the [[1951]] [[Walt Disney Productions|Disney]] animated feature film ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''. He is a mysterious, pink-and-purple-striped cat with a permanent grin. Mischievous and unpredictable in nature, the Cheshire Cat acts as a guide for [[Alice]] during her adventures in [[Wonderland]], but also takes pleasure in causing her trouble.\n\n==Background==\nThe Cheshire Cat has a practically permanent smile on his face and he can disappear at will. He is a very odd being who is able to reshape his body to either amuse or frighten his visitors. He's very mysterious, and in his own way, very dark. Like all members of [[Wonderland]], he is mad, but unlike the others, he admits it with pride. All of Wonderland's inhabitants appear to hold fear over him, even the [[Queen of Hearts]], most likely due to the fact that he is the maddest and craziest of them all, or it could be due to his unique abilities.\n\n===Personality===\nThe Cheshire Cat's true nature in the film is highly questionable, but above all, he appears to be a completely neutral character. In many instances, he's the only being in Wonderland to show kindness and sympathy towards [[Alice]], giving her advice on which path to take during her journey, practically acting as her guide to the point where she's overly joyous to see him once he returns. On the other hand, the cat has a cruel sense of humor, as seen during Alice's meeting with the Queen of Hearts; during which, he constantly caused mishaps to purposely have the Queen's dangerous temper target, Alice. This behavior carries out up into the climax, though it can be slimly argued that he caused the Queen's temper to violently erupt for the last time to assist Alice in getting home, as the climactic chase throughout Wonderland eventually leads to her awakening and finding it was all just a dream.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''===\nAfter a gamut of nonsensical events in pursuit of the [[White Rabbit]], Alice enters the [[Tulgey Wood]]. There, the Cheshire Cat arrives offering her help with directions. She tries to receive practical answers, but he continues to goof off by asking random questions, and continually showcasing his abilities. After a while, he advises her to seek answers from the [[Mad Hatter]] and the [[March Hare]]. She, not wanting to associate with mad people, denies the advice, but he claims that everyone in Wonderland is mad, including himself. He then slowly fades away into thin air, laughing and singing in the process.\n\nLater on, Alice finds the trail of the White Rabbit once again and begins to pursue him once more. She is lost again, but this time, all hope seems lost. She breaks down in tears, just when the Cheshire Cat arrives. Delighted to see him, she claims that she's no longer looking for rabbits, and wants to find her way home. However, he explains that in Wonderland, she has no way and that all ways there are the Queen's ways. Confused, she informs him that she knows nothing about the queen, so he reveals a secret passageway to her card-inhabited kingdom.\n\nDuring a croquet game with the Queen of Hearts, the Cheshire Cat arrives and continuously gets Alice into trouble with the Queen. At one point, the Cheshire Cat causes the Queen to flip over, revealing her bloomers. Out of utter embarrassment, she puts Alice on trial. With the witnesses being the Mad Hatter, March Hare, and the Dormouse, the trial gets nowhere. Soon enough, the Queen sentences Alice to death by beheading, until she finds more mushrooms in her pocket, which causes her to grow to a gigantic size. She then takes advantage of the opportunity and insults the Queen, but she shrinks down to her normal size once again. The Cheshire Cat appears once more, repeating Alice's insults which causes the Queen to lose her temper, and this leads to the climactic chase.\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\n[[File:GatoRis\u00f3n HouseOfMouse.png|thumb|250px|left|Cheshire Cat in ''House of Mouse''.]]\nThe Cheshire Cat has numerous non-speaking appearances in ''House of Mouse''.\n\nIn \"[[The Stolen Cartoons]]\", when [[Donald Duck]] proved to be a terrible host, the Cheshire Cat vanished from the club.\n\nIn \"[[Big Bad Wolf Daddy]]\", he was blown away leaving only his grin behind during the wolf's performance.\n\nIn \"[[Ask Von Drake]]\", he was seen atop the Queen of Hearts' crown during \"[[The Ludwig Von Drake Song]]\".\n\nIn \"[[Unplugged Club]]\", when [[Pete]] took out the club's battery, only his eyes and grin showed in the darkness.\n\nIn \"[[Super Goof (House of Mouse)|Super Goof]]\", he could be seen atop the March Hare's chair with the Mad Hatter pouring tea on the Hare.\n\nIn various episodes such as \"[[Mickey and Minnie's Big Vacation]]\", he could be seen clapping in a crowd with other characters when a cartoon has ended.\n\nHe also appears in ''[[Mickey's House of Villains]]'', and ''[[Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse]]''.\n\n===Other appearances===\nThe Cheshire Cat can be briefly spotted during the final scene of the film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''. His tail and also half of his face and body can be briefly seen during the final shot.\n\nIn the animated short ''[[Electric Holiday]]'', the Cheshire Cat was one of the many Disney character guests to attend [[Minnie Mouse]]'s fashion show.\n\n[[Genie]] impersonated the Cheshire Cat in the ''[[Aladdin (TV series)|Aladdin]]'' episode \"[[Moonlight Madness]]\".\n\n==Live-action appearances==\n===''[[Adventures in Wonderland]]''===\nThe Cheshire Cat was a supporting character in the 1995 series. He loves to play all manner of practical jokes on everyone, but even he occasionally performs some act of kindness.\n\n===''[[Once Upon a Time in Wonderland]]''===\n[[File:Once Upon a Time in Wonderland - 1x01 - Down the Rabbit Hole - Cheshire Cat.jpg|thumb|250px|The Cheshire Cat in ''Once Upon a Time in Wonderland''.]]\nThe Cheshire Cat is a recurring character in the TV show ''[[Once Upon a Time in Wonderland]]'', voiced by [[Keith David]].\n\nOriginally a friend of Alice, the Cheshire Cat appears many years later when she returns to Wonderland, now wild, ferocious, and apparently loyal to [[Anastasia Tremaine|the Red Queen]], in addition to being one of monstrous size.\n\nThe Cheshire Cat encounters his \"old friend\" in [[Tulgey Wood]] and attempts to eat her due to a lack of food within the woods. However, he is distracted by [[Will Scarlet|the Knave of Hearts]] and accidentally swallows a mushroom, causing him to shrink to the size of a house cat, prompting him to flee.\n\n==Video games==\n===''[[Disney's Villains' Revenge]]''===\nIn the ''Alice in Wonderland'' stage, the Cheshire Cat's grin was among the obstacles that appear in the maze as the player seeks out Alice's missing head and back. Despite this, the Cheshire Cat's image was among the heroes on the door to the storybook, confirming that he is one of them.\n\n===[[Kingdom Hearts (series)|''Kingdom Hearts'' series]]===\n[[File:Cheshire Cat KHREC.png|left|180px]]\nThe Cheshire Cat appears in several games of the ''Kingdom Hearts'' series, although most of them are minor as they take place in Wonderland. However, in ''[[Kingdom Hearts (game)|Kingdom Hearts]]'', his intentions appear to be ambiguous as he appears as either an ally or an enemy; he helps [[Sora]] during his visit to Wonderland, but also summons a Trickmaster Heartless against the group, although it appears he simply wants to test Sora towards these obstacles. The manga adaptation reveals that the Cheshire Cat was offered a place amongst [[Maleficent]]'s council of villains, but he rejected it.\n\nOther appearances of the Cheshire Cat also occurred in ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories]]'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days]]''.\n\nIn the HD re-release of ''[[Kingdom Hearts coded|Kingdom Hearts Re:coded]]'', Cheshire Cat played his first speaking role, assisting Sora in recovering Alice's memories, which went missing due to the digital world of Wonderland becoming corrupt at the hands of a bug infection.\n\n===''[[Kinect Disneyland Adventures]]''===\nThe Cheshire Cat briefly appears during the ''[[Alice in Wonderland (Disneyland attraction)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' mini-game during the player's free-fall down the rabbit hole. He has a statue in Fantasyland. He is also mentioned by the Mad Hatter<ref>'''Mad Hatter:''' Oh has the Cheshire Cat got your tongue.</ref>\n\n===''[[Epic Mickey: Power of Illusion]]''===\nIn the game, the Cheshire Cat is one of the many Disney characters kidnapped and taken to the Wasteland world of illusion, where an evil witch named [[Mizrabel]] plans to steal the essence of famous Disney characters to gain access to their world and dominating it. After Alice (who was also kidnapped) is rescued, she gives [[Mickey Mouse]] (the hero of the story) the quest to find the Mad Hatter and the Cheshire Cat before they too are drained of their energy.\n\n=== ''[[Disney Heroes: Battle Mode]]'' ===\nThe Cheshire cat appears in the game as one of the playable and unlockable characters, he can attack with his claws just by disappearing, make a smile in front of the enemies to do damage and also throw his head to damage and stun the enemies and even the ones that are invisible.\n\n==[[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Disney Parks]]==\n[[File:Ccdlp.jpg|thumb|250px|The Cheshire Cat posing for a photo at Disneyland Paris.]]\n===[[Disneyland Resort]]===\nThe Cheshire Cat appears in [[Audio-Animatronics|audio-animatronic]] form in the [[Alice in Wonderland (Disneyland attraction)|Alice in Wonderland]] dark ride, in the Tulgey Wood scene. He also appeared in the ride's finale as a giant head just before the [[Mad Tea Party]] scene but was removed from it during the ride's 2014 refurbishment.\n\nThe Cheshire Cat also appears during [[World of Color]]'s finale. In the show, his animated face is seen in the water projectors, while the rest of his body is made completely of water.\n\n===[[Walt Disney World]]===\nThe Cheshire Cat appears in the bubble montage in [[Fantasmic!]] at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]].\n\nIn [[Celebrate the Magic]] at the [[Magic Kingdom]], the Cheshire Cat's form briefly took over [[Cinderella Castle]] at one point.\n\n===[[Tokyo Disney Resort]]===\nIn [[Tokyo Disneyland Electrical Parade: DreamLights]], the Cheshire Cat appears with Alice on his back. During the parade, he demonstrates his powers by continuously disappearing leaving only his mouth, eyes, and nose in sight.\n\nThe Cheshire Cat also appeared during Alice's segment in the [[Once Upon a Time (Tokyo Disneyland)|Once Upon a Time]] castle show in [[Tokyo Disneyland]]. He currently makes daily appearances during the [[Dreaming Up!]] parade.\n\n===[[Disneyland Paris]]===\nA statue of Cheshire Cat can be spotted in [[Alice's Curious Labyrinth]]. His grin is also featured in the attraction's garden.\n\nIn [[2013]], as part of the Disney Dreamers Everywhere! events, the Cheshire Cat returned as a meet-and-greet character, appearing at [[Disneyland Paris]].\n\n===[[Hong Kong Disneyland]]===\nIn the park, the Cheshire Cat appears briefly during Alice's segment of [[Disney in the Stars]].\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*The Cheshire Cat was used as inspiration for the character [[Chaos]] in the [[Aladdin (TV series)|''Aladdin'' TV series]] as well as the [[Talking Zebra]] in ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]''.\n*The Cheshire Cat is the third Disney character originally voiced by [[Sterling Holloway]] and taken over by [[Jim Cummings]]. The first two are [[Winnie the Pooh]] and [[Kaa]].\n*When Alice first hears the Cheshire Cat, he is singing the first and last stanza of the poem \"Jabberwocky\".\n*Originally, the Cheshire Cat was supposed to sing a song called \"[[I'm Odd]]\" but was later replaced with \"[[Twas Brillig]]\". For the ''Alice in Wonderland: Special Edition'' DVD it was remastered and sung by Jim Cummings as the Cheshire Cat.\n*In ''[[Epic Mickey]]'', the Cheshire Cat was going to appear in the game at the level \"Wonderland\". But he and the level were scrapped in the final because Warren Spector didn't want to cause confusion with the Tim Burton retelling, which was going to come out at about the same time.\n*In ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'', [[Lucifer]] appears to share some similar physical properties with the Cheshire Cat: they both are rather fat in appearance, they both have a rather large grin at most points, and both have rather sharp claws. This may be because the two films were produced concurrently (1950 and 1951).\n*The original Cheshire Cat was based on an actual cat breed, the British Shorthair. It may have provided some inspiration for Disney's Cheshire Cat.\n*In the book, the Cheshire Cat is brown and tan colored.\n*In ''[[Inside Out]]'', [[Bing Bong]]'s tail looks similar to that of the Cheshire Cat.\n*He makes a cameo in [[Who Framed Roger Rabbit (NES)|''Who Framed Roger Rabbit'']]<nowiki/>, despite not appearing to the public four years after the film takes place.\n*The only time the Cheshire Cat was shown not smiling was when he was gasping from his mad laughter.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*{{WP}}\n*{{KH}}\n*{{OUAT}}\n\n{{Alice in Wonderland}}\n{{Disney Villains}}{{House of Mouse}}\n{{Kingdom Hearts}}\n{{DisneyTsumTsum}}\n{{Disney Emoji Blitz}}\n[[ar:\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0637 \u0634\u0631\u0634\u0631]]\n[[es:El Gato Ris\u00f3n]]\n[[fr:Chat du Cheshire]]\n[[it:Stregatto]]\n[[pl:Kot z Cheshire]]\n[[pt-br:Mestre Gato]]\n[[ru:\u0427\u0435\u0448\u0438\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u043e\u0442]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Alice in Wonderland characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts characters]]\n[[Category:Fantasmic characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Wonderful World of Color]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Who Framed Roger Rabbit cameos]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Epic Mickey characters]]\n[[Category:Kinect Disneyland Adventures characters]]\n[[Category:Video game bosses]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Once Upon a Time characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Infinity characters]]\n[[Category:Disney's Villains' Revenge characters]]\n[[Category:Electric Holiday]]\n[[Category:Electric Holiday Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Celebrate the Magic characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Dreams! characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Magic Kingdoms characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Heroes: Battle Mode characters]]"
