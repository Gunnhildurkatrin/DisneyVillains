He went to a present-day school called H.G. Wells Junior and Senior High School and befriended a girl named [[Keely Teslow]] who later became his girlfriend. His family includes his mother, [[Barbara Diffy|Barbara]], his father, [[Lloyd Diffy|Lloyd]], and his sister, [[Pim Diffy|Pim]]. He returns to his time by the end of the series.<ref>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0880504/</ref>.\n\n==Personality==\nPhil is best described as an easy-going, kind person. He's highly intelligent, as seen in the pilot--his math skills are phenomenal. He does, however, lack skills and knowledge that are basic to the early 21st century, so he can come across as clueless, even foolish. However, with one or two exceptions, he always manages to cover up the fact that he's from a different century. He's generally a by-the-book guy, but being trapped in a different century both forces and allows him to do things he wouldn't normally do.\n\n==Appearance and Skills==\nPhil has very dark brown hair and brown eyes. His friend, Keely Teslow, called him as the most handsome fellow at the dance in \"Neander Phil\". Many girls are attracted to him.\n\nHe is very skilled at math, in fact so skilled that he solved the most difficult sum given by [[Neil Hackett|Mr. Hackett]]. He can repair things as well, being better than Lloyd at this field.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Keely Teslow===\nFrom the time he first saw her, Phil seemed to feel drawn to Keely. Before they even knew each other, he went to great lengths to protect the fragile Christmas star that she had been assigned care of. Their friendship began when he helped her with her algebra in the first episode (chronologically speaking). A few episodes later, despite his best efforts to appear a normal person, she confronted him, wanting to know why he was acting so secretive.\n\nPhil confessed he was from the future, and to his relief, after she got over her shock, she made it clear that she would not reveal their secret to anyone and that they were still friends. Phil deeply values Keely's friendship, yet there are more and more hints that he wants a romantic relationship with her. Yet he has difficulty figuring out how he feels, let alone expressing his feelings to her, leading to many awkward, but sweet, moments throughout the series.\n==Episode Appearances==\n===Season One===\n*You Say Toe-Mato\n*Meet the Curtis\n*Unification Day\n*Phillin' In\n*Tanner\n*Raging Bull\n*My Way\n*Daddy Dearest\n*Pheromonally Yours\n*Future Jock\n*Future Tutor\n*Your Cheatin' Heart\n*Doggie Day-Care\n*We'll Fix It in Editing\n*Halloween\n*Age Before Beauty\n*Neander-Phil\n*Double Trouble\n*Milkin' It\n*Corner Pocket\n===Season Two===\n*Versa Day\n*Virtu-Date\n*The Giggle\n*Dinner Time\n*Tia, Via, or Me...
