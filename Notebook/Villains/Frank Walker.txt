Young Frank goes to a place that he thinks is the greatest in the universe and he believes the world is going to be much better off because of it. He finds out that those things were untrue and becomes probably the most cynical person one could be. He isolates himself on his family farm and plans to spend the rest of his life there but is forced to deal with his past because of situations that happen in the film.\"\n==in Tomorrowland==\n\n==Trivia==\n\n* If the movie does happen in 2015, it makes Frank 58 years old at the time. He's implied to have benefited from the recipe of Tommorowland's protein shakes to delay his aging.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Tomorrowland (film)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Walker, Frank}}\n[[de:Frank Walker]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Inventors]]\n[[Category:Tomorrowland characters]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:Characters who narrate the story]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Deuteragonists]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]"
