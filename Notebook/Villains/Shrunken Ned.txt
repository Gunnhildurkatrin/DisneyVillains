It is known that his position had something to do with the training and possible hiring of new skippers for the company.\n\nAt some point in time, Ned was decapitated and had his head shrunk albeit with supernatural forces afoot. As a result of this, Ned was preserved as a sentient shrunken-head who was subsequently mounted in the ''South Seas Traders'' shop.\n\nAt some point, Ned became a trained witch-doctor and even something of a fortune-teller (whether this was before his beheading or following it is unknown) but his head would become known as Adventureland's head witch-doctor. He would frequently give out services for those who paid.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n=== [[Adventure Trading Company]] ===\nShrunken Ned is alluded to in the Treehouse Juju mission where he is interviewed in the Daily Gnus newspaper about the Treehouse Juju and petroglyphs found at the base of [[Tarzan (character)|Tarzan]]'s [[Tarzan's Treehouse|treehouse]].\n\n=== [[Shrunken Ned's Junior Jungle Boats]] ===\nNed was the namesake for the former Shrunken Ned's Junior Jungle Boats game at the [[Magic Kingdom]]. This defunct attraction having been themed around a way to train potential skippers for the Jungle Navigation Company.\n\n===[[Skipper Canteen]]===\nOne of Shrunken Ned's fortune cards can be found on the bulletin board in the Skipper Canteen. His voice can also be heard as part of the audio in the mess-hall.\n\n=== South Seas Traders/Bengal Barbecue ===\nHe is a fortune teller machine who was located in the South Seas Traders shop area (now a dining area for the Bengal Barbecue) that takes the form of an eccentric shrunken head that bills himself as \"The Jungle's Only Self-Service Witch Doctor\", diagnosing guests with strange jungle diseases and offering equally strange solutions.\n\n=== [[Trader Sam's]] ===\n\n==== Trader Sam's Enchanted Tiki Bar ====\nA newspaper hung up on the wall has an advertisement for Shrunken Ned's services. Also in this newspaper is an article on tourists going mission in the temple of [[Mara (Indiana Jones)|Mara]].\n\n==== Trader Sam's Grog Grotto ====\nA totem of Ned's head is hung in Trader Sam's Grog Grotto in ''[[Disney's Polynesian Village Resort]]''.\n\n== Other Appearances ==\n\n=== Printed Material ===\n\n==== [[Tales from Adventureland]] ====\nShrunken Ned plays a major role in this book series as the grandfather of protagonist [[Andy Stanley]] and the leader and Keymaster of the Jungle Explorers' Society.\n\nThe first book, ''[[Tales from Adventureland: The Keymaster's Quest|The Keymaster's Quest]]'', begins at his funeral at his home in [[Oregon]], after his family assumes the worst from a mysterious disappearance taking place during an expedition to a hidden temple in the Amazon. His grandson Andy Stanley is the one family member who actually attends the funeral, which otherwise includes his friends from his organization. As Andy explores the mansion and solves several puzzles, he finds that Ned is still alive as a sentient shrunken head.\n\nWhen exploring the temple, he was ambushed by a witch doctor/assassin named Bungalow Bob working for a sinister group known as the Collective\u00a0and transformed into a living shrunken head. The funeral was an elaborate ruse to trick the Collective into thinking he was dead. He appoints Andy as the new Keymaster for the J.E.S. and assigns him to a mission to [[Hawaii]] to prevent the Collective from awakening an evil Tiki God with a key hidden in [[the Enchanted Tiki Room]].\u00a0He later becomes more actively involved in the adventures through using his robotic butler [[Robot Butler (Horizons)|Boltenhouse]] as a mechanical body.\n\n=== Video-Games ===\n\n==== [[Kinect: Disneyland Adventures]] ====\nOne of the safari characters in the Jungle Cruise mini-games looks near-identical to Ned albeit is a living person and has ginger-hair instead of white.\n\n==== Virtual Magic Kingdom ====\nNed also appeared in [[Virtual Magic Kingdom]] running a shop.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The Jungle Explorer's Society of which Ned is a member in the books was originally intended to be the [[Society of Explorers and Adventurers]].\n* Ned is one of three fortune-teller machines found in Disneyland Park. The other two are [[Esmeralda (Fortune-Teller)|Esmeralda]] on\u00a0''[[Main Street, U.S.A.]]''\u00a0and\u00a0[[Fortune Red]]\u00a0in\u00a0[[New Orleans Square]].\n\n== External Links ==\n\n* ''[https://junglecruise.fandom.com/wiki/Shrunken_Ned?venotify=created Shrunken Ned]'' on the ''[https://junglecruise.fandom.com/wiki/Jungle_Cruise_Wiki Jungle Cruise Wiki]''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nVMK Shrunken Ned.jpg|Shrunken Ned's VMK shop\nned5.jpg|Picture of Ned from the back of his fortune cards\n</gallery>\n\n{{Society of Explorers and Adventurers}}\n{{Jungle Cruise}}[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:English characters]]\n[[Category:Tales from Adventureland characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Jungle Cruise characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Grandparents]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
