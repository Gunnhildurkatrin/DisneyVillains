As a result, she is always happy to see Team Possible, and helps them however she can. \n\n\n==Biography==\nMC Honey credited Kim with being the reason for much of her success. Kim presumably helped recover a stolen demo tape for her. In return, MC Honey gave Team Possible a ride while they were in pursuit of a teleportation module supposedly stolen by Professor Dementor.<ref>Hidden Talent</ref>\n\nAfter he overheard Shego listening to one of MC Honey's songs, Dr. Drakken thought his hypnotizing shampoo would sell better if it got mentioned in a rap song, and attempted to get MC Honey on board with the idea. She refused to cooperate with him.<ref>[[Rappin' Drakken (episode)|Rappin Drakken]]</ref>\n\nMC Honey was one of several celebrities framed for theft by [[Camille Leon]] and arrested. Team Possible revealed Camille to be the real thief and had her arrested.<ref>[[Trading Faces]]</ref>\n\n==Quotes==\n===From \"Hidden Talent\"===\n*(MC Honey and her crew watch Kim and Ron fly away.)\n*Man: Check it. That girl's moves are way phat.\n*MC Honey: Phat?! They're obese, yo!\n\n===From \"Rappin' Drakken\"===\n*Drakken: Can we cut the Hip-Hop while I'm ranting? Who is this anyway? Hmm! Good beat! Decent rhymes. Ah, this MC Honey has expensive tastes. She's just going on and on about all the stuff she can buy with her bank.\n*Shego: I cannot believe you actually met MC Honey and didn't get me an autograph.\n*Drakken: I was focusing on taking over the world instead. One has to wonder about my priorities.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{Kim Possible}}\n[[Category:Kim Possible characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Singers]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
