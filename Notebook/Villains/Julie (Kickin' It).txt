"[[File:Julie_Kickin_it.jpg|thumb]]'''Julie''' is [[Milton Krupnick]]'s current girlfriend. She is known to be the niece of Sensei Ty, so in the first it was hard for her to meet with Milton, as the competition between the dojos causes both Rudy and Ty to ban them from dating in Clash of the Titans. In the end they are able to date, thanks to the very eager, but somewhat unhelpful aid from both Jack and Kim. She is a shy, smart, and nerdy girl who is Milton's female counterpart.\n\n==History==\nHer first appearance was in Clash of the Titans, where she first met with Milton and the gang.</p>\n\nSince then she has been seen in Rowdy Rudy where she told Milton she was ready to take things to the \"next level\", which Milton interprets as a kiss when she is really talking about visiting the next floor of a museum. This leads to a considerable amount of chaos when Milton asks Kim to help him get better a kissing, and Julie sees and mistakenly believes he is cheating on her. It is resolved in the end but she still threatens Kim about making a move on her man.\n[[Category:Kickin' It characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]"
