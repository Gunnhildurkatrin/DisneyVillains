He becomes [[Rico]]'s new replacement horse after [[Buck]].\n==Personality==\nPatrick is soft-spoken and serious-minded, similar to Rico. He is also very obedient and does whatever he is told. However, he can be quite gullible when told otherwise, especially by another horse.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Home on the Range]]''===\nPatrick is first seen on a cattle drive with other horses. After riding Buck to the cattle drive, Rico selects Patrick as his replacement horse to assist him on his \"mission\" because from the way he saw Buck's exchange with the cows, he interpreted it as Buck being \"skittish around cows,\" leaving Buck distraught. Sometime later, after Buck had escaped some ranchers who tried to return the stallion, he finds Patrick guarding his post at [[Echo Mine]]. He manages to trick Patrick into leaving his post by warning him about Rico. He tells Patrick that Rico will break out the horse whip when he's finished with his task, and he wasn't shy about using it. Taking Buck's advice, Patrick runs away to avoid Rico. Buck then gloats and says, \"He must be taking stupid lessons from that [[Junior the Buffalo|buffalo]].\"\n\n==Trivia==\n*His name is a possible reference to his voice actor, who also voiced [[Kronk]] in ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]'', ''[[Kronk's New Groove]]'', and ''[[The Emperor's New School]]''. Additionally, he played [[Blag]] in Disney's ''[[The Wild]]'', [[Buzz Lightyear|Buzz]]\u00a0and [[Little Green Men|LGMs]] in the ''[[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command]]'' TV series, and [[Pulaski]] in ''[[Planes: Fire & Rescue]]''.\n\n{{Home on the Range}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Home on the Range characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Horses]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]"
