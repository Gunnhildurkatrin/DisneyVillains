He will appear in ''[[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]'' played by [[Jamie Foxx]]<ref name = \"Hollywood Reporter\"/>, who previously played Electro in ''The Amazing Spider-Man''. \n\nHe appears as a recurring antagonist throughout the cartoon ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''. A female version of Electro named '''Francine Frye''' appears as a villain in the subsequent series [[Spider-Man (TV series)|''Marvel's Spider-Man'']].\n\nElectro/Max Dillon was created by [[Stan Lee]] and Steve Ditko. Electro/Francine Frye was created by Dan Slott and Humberto Ramos.\n\n==Appearances==\n===[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]===\n====[[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]====\nElectro will appear in the MCU for the first time in ''Spider-Man: No Way Home''.<ref name=\"Hollywood Reporter\" />\n\n===[[Marvel Animation]]===\n===''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''===\nBefore the events of the series, Electro previously fought Spider-Man several times. In his self-titled episode \"Electro\", Spider-Man manages to taser him against J. Jonah Jameson's large television screen, but Electro manages to disappear into the screen. Electro then appears in a hyper-electrified form and holds the city's electricity for ransom. Electro takes over Spider-Man's Spider-Cycle which takes the web-slinger's team straight into town. Spider-Man manages to anticipate where Electro is as Electro charges the tram Spider-Man's team is on towards its station. Spider-Man's team finds Electro in a part of town where he starts to turn some of the nearby electronic devices into weapons. Electro then attacks Spider-Man as he remembers that the large television screen had super-charged him. Electro then heads to the Federal Reserve as Spider-Man and Nova follow him. Electro then takes over Spider-Man's electrical web containers and fires at a building crane as a diversion so that he can get into the Federal Reserve. Spider-Man's team catches up to Electro in the vault as Spider-Man tells his team that they must act like a team to take down Electro. Spider-Man comes up with a plan that involves Electro heading to the satellite above the Daily Bugle which launched him into the orbiting satellites. After Batroc the Leaper is defeated, Spider-Man swings towards the large television screen that Electro is in. As Electro emerges from the screen, Spider-Man's team takes out the Electro clones that emerge from their electronics. Electro loses control and emerges from the screen in his normal form confused from the Electro clones that he has been controlling. Spider-Man then knocks out Electro.\n\nIn the episode \"The Sinister Six\", Electro returns in hyper-electrified form. He appears as a member of the Sinister Six alongside Doctor Octopus, Rhino, Kraven the Hunter, Beetle, and Lizard. During the fight at the Statue of Liberty between Spider-Man's team and the Sinister Six, Electro fights Iron Fist but was defeated by Nova when Spider-Man's teammates switched opponents. When most of the Sinister Six members were apprehended by S.H.I.E.L.D., Electro anchored down in his cell in which he is standing surrounded by water.\n\nIn the episode \"Return of the Sinister Six\", Electro is sprung from Ryker's Island and armored up with stolen OsCorp tech with the reassembled Sinister Six. Electro fights Spider-Man then Nova and assists the group's gang assault on Iron Patriot but is eventually defeated by Spider-Man. He escapes S.H.I.E.L.D. custody with the Green Goblin in the episode \"New Warriors\".\n\nIn the four-part \"Spider-Verse\" story arc, the Green Goblin traps Electro within the enchanted Siege Perilous ruby gem to collect the DNA of Spider-Man 2099, Spider-Girl, Spider-Man Noir, Spider-Ham, Spyder-Knight, and Miles Morales. At the end of the adventure, Spider-Man uses Electro to bring the other Spiders (dubbed Web-Warriors by Spider-Man) to help him defeat the mutated Green Goblin. Electro then takes control of the fallen Helicarrier that Green Goblin used as a hideout, transforming it into a giant robot and going on a rampage until he is stopped by the Web-Warriors.\n\n==''[[Spider-Man (TV series)|Marvel's Spider-Man]]''==\nIn the show, Electro is one of the many bounty hunters who hunted the web head in order to claim the false prize money. Electro wanted to claim the bounty merely to complete her electric suite. Due to a freak accident Electro had gained electric based powers thanks to Spider-Man's power amplifier. Her powers were drained off and she was sent to prison though she still had her electrical abilities.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n===Powers===\n*'''Electrostatic Energy Generation:''' Electro was able to generate a lot of electrical energy through his body and uses it for offense and defense.\n*'''Lighting Bolt Projection'''\n*'''Electrical Detection'''\n*'''Recharging'''\n*'''Immunity to Electricity'''\n*'''Electromagnetic Manipulation'''\n\n===Strength level===\nThanks to the electricity circulating through his body, his strength is augmented to the point where he can lift over 450 pounds.\n\n===Weaknesses===\nWhen he is fully charged, Electro is extremely sensitive to anything that may \"short circuit\" him, such as water.\n\n==Trivia==\n*''Ultimate Spider-Man'' and ''Marvel's Spider-Man'' are Electro's sixth and seventh cartoon appearance. He previously appeared in classic 80s ''Spider-Man'', 90s ''Spider-Man'', ''Spider-Man Unlimited'', ''The New Animated Series'', and ''Spectacular Spider-Man''.\n*The cartoon references the looks of his 616 and Ultimate counterpart. As the 616 version wears green and yellow tights while ultimate is comprised of blue energy.\n*Electro is voiced by Christopher Daniel Barnes, who voiced Spider-Man in the 90s animated series.\n*In ''Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man'' it is unknown if Electro is either Francine Frye or a female version of Max Dillon.\n*[[Jamie Foxx]] playing Electro is the second time an actor from a non-MCU Spider-Man production reprises his role in an MCU production. The first was [[J.K. Simmons]] as [[J. Jonah Jameson]], who appeared in ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]''. It's also the third time an actor from a non-MCU production reprises his role in an MCU production, the first one being [[Lou Ferrigno]] voicing [[Hulk]] in ''The Incredible Hulk'', ''[[The Avengers (film)|The Avengers]]'' and ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''.\n*According to Jamie Foxx, Electro won't be blue in [[Spider-Man: No Way Home]], like he was in ''The Amazing Spider-Man 2''.\n\n==Gallery==\n===''Ultimate Spider-Man''===\n<gallery position=\"center\" bordercolor=\"transparent\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nElectro first USM.png|Electro as he first appears in his debut episode.\nElectro 2.0 USM.jpg|Electro becomes mega-charged.\ntumblr n54qtubLKy1rl14rno3 1280.png\ntumblr n54qtubLKy1rl14rno4 1280.png\ntumblr n54qtubLKy1rl14rno5 1280.png\ntumblr n54qtubLKy1rl14rno7 1280.png\ntumblr n54qtubLKy1rl14rno8 1280.png\ntumblr n54qtubLKy1rl14rno9 1280.png\ntumblr mmncqoewAi1rl14rno1 1280.jpg\ntumblr n54qtubLKy1rl14rno1 1280.png\ntumblr n54qtubLKy1rl14rno2 1280.png\ntumblr n54qtubLKy1rl14rno6 1280.png\nElectro 01.png\nElectro 02.png\nElectro 06.png\nElectro 03.png\nElectro 04.png\nElectro 05.png\nElectro 07.png\nElectro 08.png\nElectro 09.png\nElectro's new form.png\nElectro Original.png\nSinisterSix-USM.png\nSinister Six 2-USM.png\nElectro.png\nBeetle & Electro USM.png\nIron Fist vs Electro.png\nElectro Beetle Dr. Octopus USM.png\nElectro gets wooped USM.png\nElectro USM 1.png\nElectro USM 2.png\nElectro USM 3.png\nElectro USM 4.png\nElectro USM 5.png\nElectro USM 6.png\nElectro USM 7.png\nElectro USM 8.png\nElectro USM 9.png\nElectro USM.png\nSinisterSix 1-USM.png\nSinisterSix 3-USM.png\nSinisterSix 4-USM.png\nSinisterSix 5-USM.png\nSinisterSix 6-USM.png\nSinisterSix 7-USM.png\nSinisterSix 8-USM.png\nSinisterSix 9-USM.png\nSinisterSix 10-USM.png\nSinisterSix 11-USM.png\nSpidy's Team vs Sinister Six.png\nSpider-Man punches Electro USMWW.png\nSpider-Man watches Electro USMWW.png\nWeb Warriors returning home USMWW.png\nSPIDER-MAN'S WEB WARRIORS USWW.png\nTumblr njhnw1NyVd1rl14rno7 1280.png\nElectro & Goblin USMWW 1.png\nElectro & Goblin USMWW.png\nElectro & Spider-Man USMWW.png\nElectro 3D USMWW.png\nElectro against the Web Warriors USMWW.png\nElectro just got grounded USMWW.png\nElectro USMWW 1.png\nElectro USMWW 2.png\nElectro USMWW 3.png\nElectro USMWW 4.png\nElectro USMWW 5.png\nElectro USMWW.png\nElectro vs Web Warriors USMWW.png\nSinisterSix 12-USM.png\nKraven & Electro USM 1.png\nKraven & Electro USM.png\nSinister Seven (The New Sinister Six).png\n</gallery>\n\n===''Marvel's Spider-Man''===\n<gallery widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordercolor=\"transparent\">\n257C9275-4B91-4006-8B7A-01D0EFADA99B.jpeg|Electro in Marvel's Spider-Man\n03DF3432-E97B-432A-8A04-768C564EB1B2.png\n5FE2A4A3-3492-44E7-9E0B-9D028524BC02.jpeg\n4B3B4F81-98B4-4BB4-B871-B161C80F3068.jpeg\n381365F8-2240-4BCC-930E-B5B8CC44E83C.png\n794213F2-61F7-4475-B141-C777351513AF.jpeg\n9DC91924-4CBC-4F57-8900-4BEAFC403712.jpeg\nD551B315-8CB8-484E-B278-7C8DAF802D25.jpeg\nCCE066AA-B70A-4DF7-9B01-BD0AAE5195E8.jpeg\n841D1B3D-D68F-430A-8362-4B3546AE8DCE.jpeg\n29935AF6-B16B-40A7-8523-0B6A02D55CCC.png\n91B7E562-49E8-41B8-9B05-7D8AC6325127.png\n</gallery>\n\n===''Marvel Super Hero Adventures''===\n<gallery widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordercolor=\"transparent\">\nElectro in Marvel Super Hero Adventures.png\n</gallery>\n\n===Video Games===\n<gallery bordercolor=\"transparent\" widths=\"150\" position=\"center\">\nElectro Portrait Art.png|Electro as he appears in ''Marvel: Avengers Alliance''\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Marvel Animated Universe}}\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Ultimate Spider-Man characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Spider-Man characters]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Upcoming characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]"
