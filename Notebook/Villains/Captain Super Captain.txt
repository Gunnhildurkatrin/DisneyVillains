Though he is overconfident with his superpowers, he does learn to acknowledge that his non-super talents can also make him a hero, thanks to Penn. He also appears to have a strong degree of care for allies and relatives whether they be mind-controlled or simply evil, as he often implores them to be good rather than directly fight them. Much to the irritation of everyone else, Captain Super Captain has a habit of taking time to announce his name in a bombastic manner.\n\n==Trivia==\n*It is revealed in \"[[I'm Still Super!]]\" that Captain Super Captain and his brother are Jewish.\n*He is probably a good singer, as he sang at Giant Old Lady's son's wedding.\n*His voice actor, Adam West, was famously known to portray DC character Batman from the 1960s to the 1980s.\n*In \"[[Save the Worlds]]\", Captain Super Captain reveals that he is allergic to monkeys.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Penn Zero: Part-Time Hero}}\n[[Category:Superheroes]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Penn Zero: Part-Time Hero characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Jewish characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Twins and Triplets]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
