Mrs. Pleakley wanted her son to find a woman to marry, though she doesn't know that Pleakley doesn't want to get married. One of the bridges she picked was hideous. Pleakley didn't want to call off the wedding because he didn't want to disgrace his family's good name, so he lied saying he's already getting married. However, she, along with her only daughter, [[Pixley Pleakley|Pixley]], and other son, [[Bertley Pleakley|Bertley]], arrived through a wormhole. They were caught by Pleakley's living situation regards to living in a human house with humans and [[Jumba Jookiba|an evil scientist]], and wearing female clothes. They kept buying Pleakley lies, in spite of keeping Experiment 032 ([[Fibber]]) out of it, and believed Nani is his fiance. Though she was happy that he was, she even gave him the name \"Wendy\" to which she couldn't understand why he was always embarrassed as it means \"brave warrior\" on their home planet. With being swept into more lies, with Jumba taking [[Nani Pelekai|Nani]]'s place, Gantu happens to arrive and when Stitch threw him away, he unknowingly said \"lie detector\" which made Pleakley to tell the truth about everything. The family were upset, with his mother saying he's not fit for the name \"Wendy\"; however, Fibber beeped at all their lies, revealing the family doesn't hate him, in their moment of honesty, Mrs. Pleakley blames herself for what their children said and their positions, saying she pushed them all too hard just for them to be happy. Though Pleakley tells her that he is happy with his family. They than made amends with each other and left.\n\nMrs. Pleakley, along with Pixley and Bertley, appeared again in ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]'', where they attend Pleakley being awarded of the position of being Head of Earth Studies at Galactic Alliance Community College, where she nudged a sleeping Bertley to wake him up.\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pleakley, Mrs.}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
