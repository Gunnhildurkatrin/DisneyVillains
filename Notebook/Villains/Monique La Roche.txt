However, Monique's joy to finally meet someone like Phileas Fogg who actually likes her painting is overturned when her boss finds her not doing her job as a coat-check girl, shows displeasure in her painting, and fires her; telling her to \"leave art to the artists.\" Later, while Passepartout is fighting off the Black Scorpions in another room, Monique and Phileas can be seen discussing some of her other works she painted months ago without inspiration.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the original novel, an Indian princess named Princess Aouda, whom Phileas Fogg and Passepartout rescued from a forced ''suttee'' in India, was Phileas Fogg's original love interest.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nLauladies.jpg|Dressed as ladies\nLauinvention2.jpg|Monique and her friends on day 80/79 in England\nLauwin.jpg|Monique and her friends making it to the top step of the Royal Academy of Science after winning the bet\n</gallery>\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n{{Around the World in 80 Days}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:LaRoche, Monique}}\n[[Category:Around the World in 80 Days characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:French characters]]\n[[Category:Artists]]\n[[Category:Tritagonists]]"
