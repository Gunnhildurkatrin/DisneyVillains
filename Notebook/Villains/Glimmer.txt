She is a storm-talent fairy.\n\n==Background==\nAs mentioned above, Glimmer is a storm-talent fairy and has dedicated most of her time to training for the Pixie Hollow Games. Her constant training even prevents her from traveling to the Mainland with the other fairies. It took her three tries to actually become the partner of [[Rumble]] for the Games. Like Rumble, she is in it to win, but unlike her partner, she is not conceited.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Pixie Hollow Games]]''===\nGlimmer is the partner of renowned storm-talent sparrowman [[Rumble]] in the Pixie Hollow Games. Together, they prove to be an unstoppable force throughout many of the competitions. They came in second during the first event, which made Rumble upset and caused Glimmer to have to boost his ego. During the rest of the games, they came in first many times. At the last event, Rumble cheated by using her lightning powers to zap [[Rosetta]] and [[Chloe (fairy)|Chloe]]'s cart wheels. Glimmer decided not to cross the finish line, which made Rosetta and Chloe win, since both team members had to cross the finish line together in order to win.\n\n===''[[The Pirate Fairy]]''===\nGlimmer can be seen beside [[Clank and Bobble|Clank]] in the audience in the Four Seasons Festival.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Glimmer shares the name and appearance of a character from ''The Hunger Games''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nRumble and Glimmer during the first appearance in Pixie Hollow Games.png\nRumble and Glimmer during the first appearance in Pixie Hollow Games3.png\nImageofglimmernadrumble.jpg|Glimmer and Rumble\nImageofglimmer.jpg\nRumble and Glimmer champion rings.png\nRumble and Glimmer after the first round.png\nRumble and Glimmer on the mouse polo.png\nGlimmer 1.png\nTmp -1411803050.jpeg|Glimmer, Terence, Bobble and Lyria\nBobble, Ivy, Terence, Fairy Gary, Glimmer & Lyria in The Pirate Fairy.png\nAll Fairys & Other Fairies in The Pirate Fairy.png\nGlimmer and Chloe Doll.png\n93e0d40671728f328d5fdd583cc2c9a7.jpg\nGlimmer Full Roster.jpg\nDDA370B9-9D16-48B7-82D1-149AE1ABD8C8.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Disney Fairies}}\n\n[[ru:\u0413\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043c\u0435\u0440]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n\n[[Category:Disney Fairies characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Fairies]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
