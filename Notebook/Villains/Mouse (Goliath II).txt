He is an arrogant bully who takes pleasure in nothing more than frightening elephants with his dimunitive size. However, he finally meets his match when he comes face to face with [[Goliath II (character)|Goliath II]].\n\n==Role in the film==\nThe Mouse gets a kick out of scaring elephants so, when [[Goliath I]]'s herd has a run-in with him, everyone runs away scared of him (save for Goliath II). When he realizes that Goliath II isn't scared, he asks why, and Goliath II points out that he and the mouse are of similar size. The mouse, however, says that it doesn't matter because elephants are naturally scared of mice. After teasing Goliath II, he decides to count to 3, threatening to hurt the minature elephant if the latter doesn't run away in fear by then. When Goliath II still doesn't move, a fight ensues in which the mouse attempts to kill Goliath II by throwing him off a cliff and into the open mouth of a hungry [[Tick-Tock the Crocodile|crocodile]]. However, in the end, Goliath II is able to turn the tables on the mouse, who is the one left hanging over the crocodile instead and surrenders after some negotiation.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The Mouse and [[Timothy Q. Mouse]] from ''[[Dumbo (1941 film)|Dumbo]]'' share a few common things: they're both mice with Brooklyn accents and they can easily scare elephants. But unlike Timothy, the Mouse is an arrogant bully who takes pleasure in nothing more than frightening elephants with his dimunitive size while Timothy scares elephants only if they are mean to [[Dumbo (character)|Dumbo]], he isn't a circus animal, he starts out as an antagonist at first, and he's Goliath II's enemy until his reformation after losing a battle with him.\n* The scene where the Mouse scares the elephant herd is recycled animation from ''[[Dumbo (1941 film)|Dumbo]]'', where Timothy scares the Gossipy elephants.\n*The mouse's voice is similar to that of King Nozmo, one of Paul Frees' non-Disney roles in Rocky and Bullwinkle for Jay Ward Productions.\n*Timothy Q. Mouse was an inspiration for the Mouse's creation.\n*[[Paul Frees]], the Mouse's voice actor, also voiced Cousin Muscles from the Tom and Jerry short '''''Jerry's Cousin''''' at [[Metro Goldwyn Mayer|MGM]], whom co-incidently is also a mouse.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nDisney's Goliath II Mouse scare.jpg|Mouse scaring the elephant herd\nGoliath2nd 05-Goliath II.jpg|Mouse confronting [[Goliath II (character)|Goliath II]]\nGoliath2nd 04-Goliath II.jpg|Mouse fighting off Goliath II 1\nGoliath2nd 03-Goliath II.jpg|Mouse fighting off Goliath II 2\nGoliath2nd 02-Goliath II.jpg|Mouse fighting off Goliath II 3\nGoliath2nd 01-Goliath II.jpg|Mouse defeated\nMouse airwishane.png|Mouse's defeat\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Mice]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Goliath II characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Anti-villains]]"
