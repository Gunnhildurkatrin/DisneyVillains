And you're going to marry a princess!|King Hubert reminding [[Prince Phillip|his son]] of his arranged marriage}}\n'''King Hubert''' is a supporting character in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[1959]] feature film ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]''. He is the father of [[Prince Phillip]] and [[King Stefan]]'s longtime friend.\n\n==Background==\nKing Hubert seems to be a fairly jolly character; however, no one knows the whereabouts of his queen. He has one son by her, however, [[Prince Phillip]], and is shown to be good friends with [[Aurora]]'s father [[King Stefan]]. At one point, he becomes angry due to a perceived slight against his son, leading to the beginnings of a fight between himself and Stefan, using fish as the primary weapons instead of swords. However, he comes to see the ridiculousness and hilarity of the scene and quickly makes up with his friend.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nKing Hubert is an obese man with fair skin, gray hair and beard and black eyes. He wears a red puffy-sleeved robe with a black shawl collar over a blue and yellow tunic with a brown stripe and blue diamond-shaped necklace.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Sleeping Beauty]]''===\nKing Hubert first appears at Aurora's christening along with his young son, Phillip, announced by the [[Lord Duke|royal herald]]. It is revealed that he was the long time friend of Stefan, as well as the king of a neighboring kingdom. He and Stefan decide to betroth their children, Aurora and Phillip, in the hopes that they will marry and unite their two kingdoms. Unfortunately, during the festivities, an evil fairy named Maleficent arrives and crashes the party. As revenge for not being invited, Maleficent curses the baby to die by pricking her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday. Although Merryweather was able to soften the curse so Aurora would not die, but just fall into an enchanted sleep and be awakened by true love's kiss, Stefan was still fearful and decided to have Aurora live with the good fairies in a cottage deep in the woods until her sixteenth birthday.\n\nSixteen years later, Hubert is seen at Stefan's castle, awaiting Aurora's return eating in the dining room. During which, Hubert and Stefan quarrel over the future of their children. Hubert grabs a fish by mistake trying to strike Stefan and they burst out laughing when Hubert finally realizes what he is holding. Hubert then receives a visit from Phillip, who reveals that he has fallen in love with a peasant girl, and intends to marry her. Hubert is bereft upon hearing this, but neither Hubert, Stefan, or the others realize that the peasant girl is actually Aurora, who has been in a hiding place because of the threat of [[Maleficent]]'s curse.\n\nUnfortunately, Maleficent is able to track down Aurora and her curse is fulfilled and [[Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather]] decided to make everyone asleep until Aurora awakens. Hubert attempts to tell Stefan of his son's plan, but falls into enchanted sleep before Stefan can hear him. However, Hubert's words as he falls asleep help the fairies to realize that Phillip was the young man that Aurora had met earlier and fallen in love within the woods. As a result, the fairies leave to find Phillip in order to break the curse.\n\nOnce the curse is broken, Hubert awakens and attempts to tell Stefan of Phillip's intentions. However, he does not finish as Phillip descends down the staircase, arm in arm with Aurora. He is confused by the scene, but appears to be happy regardless as he was unaware that Aurora is indeed \"a peasant\" in disguise.\n\n===''[[Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: Follow Your Dreams]]''===\nHubert is one of the characters from ''Sleeping Beauty'' that return in ''Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: Follow Your Dreams''. He attends a Royal Conference along with Phillip, Stefan and Queen Leah, in which Hubert is due to give a speech. However, Hubert realizes he has forgotten his speech at Stefan's castle only when he is already at the Royal Conference. Hubert tries to find it everywhere until the fairies arrive and deliver him his speech. Hubert is next seen at the end of the film, along with Stefan, Leah, Phillip, the fairies, and [[ The Duke|Lord Duke]], attending a royal banquet organized by Aurora.\n\n===Other appearances===\nKing Hubert appears in the episode \"[[Clarabelle's Christmas List]]\" of the series ''[[House of Mouse]]'' with [[Aurora]].\n\n==Live-action appearances==\n===''[[Maleficent (film)|Maleficent]]''===\nAlthough he doesn't directly appear, he sends [[Prince Phillip]], to [[King Stefan]]'s [[King Stefan's Castle|castle]]. In this version, he is known as '''King John of [[Ulstead]]'''.\n\n===''[[Maleficent: Mistress of Evil]]''===\n[[File:Maleficent Mistress of Evil (14).png|thumb|250px|Robert Lindsay as King John in the sequel to ''Maleficent'']]\nKing John, along with his wife, [[Queen Ingrith]], appears in the sequel. He is portrayed by Robert Lindsay. Unlike Ingrith, he seeks to establish peace between [[Ulstead]] and the [[Moors]]. Following his [[Prince Phillip|son]]'s engagement, John and Ingrith hold a banquet, to celebrate the young couples upcoming nuptials. During the dinner, tensions rise while [[Maleficent]] and Ingrith discuss the fatalities on their respective sides, each claiming the other is responsible. When Maleficent loses her temper, Ingrith enacts her secret plan to overthrow the king, by cursing him with a [[Spinning Wheel|spindle]] and blaming Maleficent. Now under a sleeping curse, Phillip urges his mother to kiss John, falsely believing in their relationship, but it doesn't work, as Ingrith secretly despises her husband for desiring peace. The King's cursed state sets off the motions, resulting in a war between Ulstead and [[Fairies (Maleficent)|magical beings]] of the Moors, as well as the [[Dark Fey]].\n\nAfterward, Prince Phillip ends the war between Ulstead and all the fairies; and as Ingrith is transformed into a goat for her tyranny, Maleficent destroys the spindle and breaks the curse, awakening the king. He is later seen attending the wedding between Aurora and Phillip at the end, informing [[Diablo|Diavel]] that Maleficent can only change Ingrith if they wanted too, implying that he wanted Ingrith to remain a goat as punishment for her crimes until she learns the error of her ways. He also told Phillip how proud he is of him for succeeding in achieving peace between Ulstead and the Moors.\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*While not making any viewable appearances in the [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney theme parks]], Aurora has mentioned that he attends the EPCOT Food and Wine Festival, eating at all the restaurants.\n*There was originally a scene that could have taken place in the beginning where King Hubert and King Stefan argue about the future of their children and compare portraits of their young children, a song called \"It Happens I have a Picture\" (heard in [[The Legacy Collection: Sleeping Beauty]]), sung by [[Bill Thompson]] and [[Hans Conried]]. While Conried was possibly switched into voicing the [[The Duke|herald]] as [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Holmes Taylor Holmes] took over the voice role for Stefan, Bill Thompson was finalized as Hubert in the final film.\n*King Hubert's wife was not seen or mentioned in the original film. His wife made her first appearance in ''Maleficent: Mistress of Evil'' and was given the name \"Ingrith\".\n{{Sleeping Beauty}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hubert}}\n[[fr:Roi Hubert]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Sleeping Beauty characters]]\n[[Category:Kings]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Maleficent characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]"
