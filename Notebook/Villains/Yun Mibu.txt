Like all clouded leopards, Yun Mibu is a very good climber and is able to hang upside down due to his strong back legs and stability.\n\n==Role in the series==\n\n===''[[Friends to the End (The Lion Guard)|Friends to the End]]''===\nAs the [[Lion Guard]] travels through a forest nearing the end of their journey to the [[Tree of Life (The Lion Guard)|Tree of Life]], they notice Yun Mibu hanging upside down in a tree and he introduces himself. Everyone is amazed at his hanging abilities except for [[Kion]]. He aggressively tells the Guard that mingling with other animals slows their way to the Tree of Life and even growls at Yun Mibu, (which was all due to the venom in his scar affecting him), scaring him away. [[Beshte]] tells an out-of-control Kion to know why he roared at the clouded leopard to which he explains about the Guard's situations with the mother goose and a pride of peacocks to which he says that the Guard can't stop whenever they encounter a new animal which slows down the Guard. As it is explained that Kion was rude to the peacock leader and Yun Mibu in the situations Kion faced, he runs off to cool himself.\n\nLater, when Kion is in danger of falling off a very high cliff, [[Beshte]] recruits Yun Mibu to help him. He is hesitant at first seeing he has to save \"the scary guy\", but the Guard convinces Yun Mibu to help, insisting Kion is a gentle animal, and that he wasn't himself earlier. Yun Mibu approaches Kion, who tries to apologies for earlier, though Yun Mibu settles for Kion promising not to growl at him anymore. When Kion wonders if the plan will work, [[Ono]] assures him that clouded leopards are excellent climbers, something Yun Mibu proves by hanging from a stump by his tail. When the tree branch starts to break, Kion is forced to jump to Yun Mibu's paws, allowing [[Anga]] to fly him to safety.\n\nWhen Kion thanks Yun Mibu for his help and asks if there's anything he can do for him in return, Yun Mibu simply asks that Kion remember never to growl at a clouded leopard since they don't like it. Yun Mibu then bids the Lion Guard a farewell after accepting Kion's apology.\n\n==Relationships==\n\n===Friends===\n\n====[[Kion]]====\nAt first, Yun Mibu was scared of Kion, since he growled at him. This was due to Kion being mad at the Lion Guard not  for helping other animals but delaying on their way to the Tree of Life. However, when Kion is clinging on a branch, he even helped saved him with teamwork from Anga. They turned out to be good friends as Kion promised to never growl at him again.\n\n====[[Beshte]]====\nYun Mibu and Beshte are good friends. Beshte was very nice to him as he always is when he sees a new animal. When Beshte tells him Kion is in danger and is a gentle animal, he does trust what he says to him.\n\n====[[Bunga]]====\nYun Mibu and Bunga are good friends. Bunga climbs the tree just like what the clouded leopard did.\n\n====[[Ono]]====\nYun Mibu and Ono are good friends. Ono was amazed when he saw a clouded leopard as he never saw one before to which he comments that clouded leopards climb better than any other leopard.\n\n====[[Fuli]], [[Makini]], and [[Anga]]====\nYun Mibu is on good terms with the girls in the group. Anga and Makini were amazed at him. Yun Mibu even did teamwork with Anga to help rescue Kion.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\">\nThe Lion Guard Friends to the End WatchTLG snapshot 0.08.16.500 1080p.png\nThe Lion Guard Friends to the End WatchTLG snapshot 0.08.20.493 1080p.png|\"My name is Yun Mibu.\"\nThe Lion Guard Friends to the End WatchTLG snapshot 0.08.26.739 1080p.png|\"This is nothing\"\nThe Lion Guard Friends to the End WatchTLG snapshot 0.08.28.697 1080p.png\nThe Lion Guard Friends to the End WatchTLG snapshot 0.08.34.373 1080p.png|\"That's right, I am!\"\nThe Lion Guard Friends to the End WatchTLG snapshot 0.08.41.844 1080p.png\nThe Lion Guard Friends to the End WatchTLG snapshot 0.08.41.947 1080p.png\nThe Lion Guard Friends to the End WatchTLG snapshot 0.18.56.184 1080p.png\nThe Lion Guard Friends to the End WatchTLG snapshot 0.19.05.807 1080p.png|\"You didn't tell me it was the scary guy that needed to be rescued.\"\nThe Lion Guard Friends to the End WatchTLG snapshot 0.19.21.476 1080p.png|\"Uh, Kion, is it?\"\nThe Lion Guard Friends to the End WatchTLG snapshot 0.19.30.251 1080p.png|\"Uh, how about a promise, instead?\nThe Lion Guard Friends to the End WatchTLG snapshot 0.19.30.901 1080p.png\nThe Lion Guard Friends to the End WatchTLG snapshot 0.19.39.522 1080p.png|\"Then let's get you up from there.\"\nThe Lion Guard Friends to the End WatchTLG snapshot 0.19.49.761 1080p.png\nThe Lion Guard Friends to the End WatchTLG snapshot 0.19.52.065 1080p.png\nThe Lion Guard Friends to the End WatchTLG snapshot 0.19.54.437 1080p.png|\"Reach out...\nThe Lion Guard Friends to the End WatchTLG snapshot 0.19.55.671 1080p.png|I've got you.\"\nThe Lion Guard Friends to the End WatchTLG snapshot 0.20.07.039 1080p.png\nThe Lion Guard Friends to the End WatchTLG snapshot 0.20.07.485 1080p.png|\"Gotcha!\"\nThe Lion Guard Friends to the End WatchTLG snapshot 0.20.16.047 1080p.png\nThe Lion Guard Friends to the End WatchTLG snapshot 0.20.21.603 1080p.png\nThe Lion Guard Friends to the End WatchTLG snapshot 0.20.22.902 1080p.png\nThe Lion Guard Friends to the End WatchTLG snapshot 0.20.26.186 1080p.png\nThe Lion Guard Friends to the End WatchTLG snapshot 0.20.30.118 1080p.png|\"You're gonna need a bigger tail\"\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*He is the only clouded leopard in the ''Lion King'' franchise.\n*\"Yun Mibu\" means \"cloud\" in Chinese.\n\n{{The Lion King}}\n[[Category:Leopards and cheetahs]]\n[[Category:The Lion Guard characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Asian characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Cats]]"
