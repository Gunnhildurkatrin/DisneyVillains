She beholds the power to enchant a land with happiness and prosperity by singing and can sing others to sleep.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Fun and Fancy Free]]''===\nThe Golden Harp is what provides [[Happy Valley]] with its peace and prosperity until she is stolen by [[Willie the Giant]], where she is locked inside a small chest. [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]], [[Donald]] and [[Goofy]] arrive at Willie's castle to rescue her and use a key to free her inside. To help the three, the Golden Harp puts Willie to sleep so that the three can escape safely. After the three rescue her, the valley is restored to its normal state.\n\n===''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''===\nShe makes a cameo appearance during the final scene.\n\n===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===\nAlthough not technically a character, in the [[ABC]] series ''Once Upon a Time'', the Golden Harp is referenced as a normal golden harp, and appears in the episode \"[[Tiny (Once Upon a Time)|Tiny]]\". This harp is [[Willie the Giant|Anton the Giant]]'s most prized possession and the reason for which he is curious about the human beings.\n\n==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==\nThe Golden Harp appears on a float in [[SpectroMagic]] as part of a group of enchanted instruments in a band consisting of Goofy, [[Genie]] and [[Chip and Dale]].\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*The Golden Harp bears some resemblance to both [[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]] (at least sharing a similar hairstyle with Cinderella's ball outfit) and [[Tinker Bell]]. All three characters were animated by [[Les Clark]], but the Golden Harp made her debut in 1947, three-six years prior to the others.\n*Despite her disliking to be held hostage by Willie, she does not seem to fear him, possibly because he is too dim-witted to be intimidating.\n*It\u2019s possible that her mere presence makes Willie happier and even increases his self-esteem.\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Cody Martin]] (portrayed the Golden Harp in \"[[Once Upon a Suite Life]]\")\n\n{{Fun and Fancy Free}}\n{{Disney Infinity}}\n{{Disney Crossy Road}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Who Framed Roger Rabbit cameos]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Magical Objects]]\n[[Category:Fun and Fancy Free characters]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Instruments]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Once Upon a Time objects]]\n[[Category:Animated characters in live-action films]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Disney Infinity characters]]\n[[Category:Angels]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Disney Crossy Road characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
