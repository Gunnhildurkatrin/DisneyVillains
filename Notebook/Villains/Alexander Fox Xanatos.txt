He is featured in the [[Disney Television Animation|Disney]] animated television show, ''[[Gargoyles]]''.\n\n==Role in the series==\nAlex Xanatos was born in the [[Eyrie Building]], the same night that the [[Avalon]] travelers returned from their \"World Tour.\" On the very night of his birth, [[Oberon]], who was searching for his queen [[Titania]], was convinced by her to take Alex, who was of their bloodline, to Avalon, where he could be trained in his magical heritage. His parents were opposed to having their child taken away just after he was born, so Oberon promised an hour until he comes to claim Alex. David Xanatos, with [[Owen Burnett]]'s security system and the assistance of the newly reunited Manhattan Clan and Alex's maternal grandfather Halcyon Renard, staved off Oberon but was unable to prevent him from entering the bed-chamber containing Alex and Fox. Fox, with some urging from her mother, Titania, tapped into her latent magical energy. Titania expostulated that if Fox could use her magic after a life in the mortal realm, Alex, with training, could retain his magical heritage. Oberon consented and bound [[Puck (Gargoyles)|Puck]] as his tutor, though he was restricted to using his magic in training or protecting Alexander.\n\nPuck gave Alex his first magical lesson later, wherein he taught Alex to swap souls. Alex and Puck transferred the souls of Othello, Desdemona, and Iago from the [[Coldstone]] body into [[Broadway]], [[Angela]], and [[Brooklyn]], respectively. Later, he transferred them again into robotic bodies of Coldstone, [[Coldfire]], and Coldsteel. In order to accomplish this feat, Alex possessed the body of [[Lexington]], thereby forging something of a bond between the two. In that case, when Fox made an effort to reconcile with Lexington when the clan was invited back to the castle, Lexington agreed to that for Alex's sake.\n\nAlex seems to be growing and maturing very quickly. At four months old he was already beginning to talk. During Alex's first Halloween, his father brought him to the White House, where Ambassador Chung remarked that he was very large for his age of not quite four months, appearing to be about a full year.\n\n===Future Tense===\nIn the episode \"[[Future Tense]]\", Alexander, at that point called Fox, was a part of a resistance against his father, David Xanatos. Xanatos the senior tricked him into revealing the hideout of the rebels before destroying him. His fellow rebels were inspired to attack Xanatos before he could strike against them.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Alex was named by his parents after {{WikipediaLink|Alexander the Great}}, the famous Macedonian king (336 B.C. - 323 B.C.) who conquered most of the known world, as a reflection of their ambitions for him.\n*One thing that Alex's parents and maternal grandmother agree on is that Alex has a glorious future ahead of him.\n*Alex is closest to Lexington after his parents, calling him \"doggie\". At the end of \"Ransom\" Alex is cradled by Lex until sunrise. The happy child gave the now-stone gargoyle a kiss on the cheek.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\n-alex and fox.jpg\nDavid and Alex.png\nGathering part one 1278.jpg\nXanatos-fox-baby-alex.png\nDavid-with-alexander.png\nFox-alex-owen-burnett.png\nBabysitter.jpg|Baby Alex and Lex\nFox_Alex.jpg|\"Future Tense\" Alexander\nFTAlexander.jpg\nimages2.jpg\nLex and Alex - Ransom (7).jpg\nLex and Alex - Ransom (5).jpg\nLex and Alex - Ransom (3).jpg\nLex and Alex - Ransom (2).jpg\nLex and Alex - Ransom (1).jpg\nAlex Xanoatos - Ransom (1).jpg\nLex and Alex - Ransom (11).jpg\nLex and Alex - Ransom (10).jpg\nLex and Alex - Ransom (9).jpg\nAlex and Lexington - Ransom (2).jpg\nAlex and Lexington - Ransom (1).jpg\nAlex Xanatos - Ransom.jpg\nFox and Xanatos - The Gathering Pt 1 (1).png\nFox and Xanatos - The Gathering Pt 1.png\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*[http://gargwiki.net/Alexander_Fox_Xanatos Alexander Fox Xanatos] at GargWiki\n\n{{Gargoyles}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Xanatos, Alexander}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Gargoyles characters]]\n[[Category:Infants]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Fairies]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Toddlers]]\n[[Category:Kids]]"
