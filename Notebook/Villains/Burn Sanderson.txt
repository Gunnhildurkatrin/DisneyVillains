As he leaves, however, [[Arliss Coates|Arliss]] explodes in anger, throwing a rock that makes Burn's horse rear and throw him off. He is angry at first but then takes Arliss on his knee and agrees to trade Old Yeller for a horned toad and home-cooked meal, which Katie supplies with pleasure. Upon leaving, he informs Travis that a plague of hydrophobia, or rabies, is affecting local animals, with telltale signs that include staggering, viciousness, and unprovoked attacks.
