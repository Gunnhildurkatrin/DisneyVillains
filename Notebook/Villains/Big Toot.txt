Just as Little Toot playfully floats across the harbor, he upsets Big Toot for the playful antics he did. In anger, he scolds him to act like a real tugboat to which despite this, Little Toot still behaves in a playful manner until he follows Big Toot hauling another ship. Just as he spins it, Big Toot reacts in shock much to Little Toot's antics, causing the ship to crash onto the big city.
