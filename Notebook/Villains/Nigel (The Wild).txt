However, when Nigel is abducted by wildebeests upon reaching [[Africa]], they worship him and make him their king, and their leader [[Kazar]] dubs him as the \"Great Him.\" Nigel soon sees the error of his ways when the wildebeests attempt to eat his zoo friends and escapes with the others. He is good friends with [[Larry]] but often angers [[Bridget]] and [[Samson (The Wild)|Samson]] with his mild, dry humor.\u00a0He treats [[Ryan]] fairly well and has a very evident personality clash with [[Benny (The Wild)|Benny]], most likely because Benny is softhearted and responsive, while Nigel is delusional and lazy, although he does mean well. He is last seen dancing on the boat\u00a0with his zoo friends as it sails home, and [[Breaking the Fourth Wall|breaks the fourth wall]] just before the credits roll.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nNigel the Koala.png\nNigel1.jpg|Nigel holding Lady Liberty's torch\nNigel2.jpg|Nigel sunbathing while sitting on top of Larry\nNigel3.jpg|Nigel with an empty popcorn container stuck on him\nthe-wild-disneyscreencaps.com-1407.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Wild}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:The Wild characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Koalas]]\n[[Category:Zoo Animals]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Australian characters]]"
