She is Vigor's keeper and agent.\n==Role in the series==\nCanardist first appeared in\u00a0\"[[Vigor the Visionary]]\", offering Rapunzel and Eugene to have their fortune read by [[Vigor]] for at a cost of five silver coins. After some lights flash in her cart, she gives them a paper saying \"If you see someone falling, pick them up.\" After that couple leaves - with Eugene feeling ripped-off - they hear the woman yell that\u00a0Vigor\u00a0has been monkey-napped.\u00a0Eugene\u00a0only agrees to look for him after he spots the comb he gave to\u00a0Angry.\n\nWhen Eugene and Rapunzel finally catch up with\u00a0Angry and Red, Angry explains their own cheaper encounter with Madam Canardist. Their reading was about\u00a0Angry's necklace and family. When the kids asked for more details, she says \"No money, no\u00a0monkey.\" So they swipe the simian to show them to Angry's family. After a lightly quest using both fortunes, Madam Canardist charges five more coins.\n\nMadam Canardist returns with Vigor again in \"[[Curses! (Tangled)|Curses!]] where she finds Rapunzel's telescope and claims it as her own. After Rapunzel takes it back, Madam Canardist makes her think she is now cursed, which worries Rapunzel as bad things tend to happen. Rapunzel soon starts to think about returning the telescope to Madam Canardist.\n\nMadam Canardist later appears foe the final time in \"[[Lost and Found (Tangled)|Lost and Found]]\", where she and Rapunzel make amends since their last encounter (\"Curses!\") and she and Eugene follow Vigor who shows himself as [[Lord Demanitus]] to show Rapunzel where the last piece of the scroll is. Rapunzel and Eugene are able to find the final piece of the scroll and Demanitis' spirit leaves Vigor's body forever, Vigor is later returned to Madam Canardist and she says it is free (which she doesn't like) but Eugene gives her the money anyway. Madam Canardist then returns to give them a little note that Eugene reads which says a member of Rapunzel's group will turn against her (which is revealed to be [[Cassandra (Tangled)|Cassandra]] in the finale).\n\n<br />\n\n== Physical Appearance ==\nMadam Canardist appears to be an old woman with fair skin, black wavy hair, gray eyes, a beauty mark under her right eye, and a pointed nose with a mole on it. Her left eye is the only thing closed. For make-up, she has on cyan eye shadow. For gypsy wear, she has on a dress made of white, short-sleeved blouse, a light purple vest over it, a dark teal and cyan skirt with a white petticoat underneath, and a dark purple apron. For accessories, she wears a dark red head scarf, a pair of mixed earrings, two necklaces, and two bracelets.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Madame Canardist is most likely based on the Gypsy interpreter who was supposed to appear alongside Vigor in ''[[Tangled]]''. Like Vigor, she, too, was deleted from the finished movie.\n*Madam Canardist never knew that Vigor held the spirit of his previous owner [[Lord Demanitus]] inside his body. Nor did she know that Vigor was over 1000 years old.\n*Her name is a pun on \"con artist.\"\n\n==Gallery==\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nVigor the Visionary 59.png\nVigor the Visionary 60.png\nVigor the Visionary 61.png\nVigor the Visionary 62.png\nVigor the Visionary 68.png\nVigor the Visionary 70.png\nCurses!
