He is an angel-demon and the high chancellor of the Magic High Commission.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nThough Lekmet only speaks in goat sounds, his personality comes through largely in his mannerisms. He shows a deep level of care for his companions and mainly serves as an observer to Rhombulus' conflict with Glossaryck.\n\n===Physical Appearance===\nLekmet mainly bears the appearance of an anthropomorphic goat. He has pale cream fur, yellow eyes with diamond-shaped pupils, four brown horns (two pointed straight upward, two curled on the sides of his head), a long gray beard, and large bat-like wings. He wears a long brownish-gray cloak.\n\n==Trivia==\n*According to ''[[Star and Marco's Guide to Mastering Every Dimension]]'', Lekmet was created by [[Glossaryck]] so that Mewmans would have an understanding of the impermanence of existence.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"180\" position=\"center\">\nCrystal Clear Concept Art - Lekmet 4.png\nCrystal Clear Concept Art - Lekmet 3.png\nCrystal Clear Concept Art - Lekmet 2.png\nCrystal Clear Concept Art - Lekmet 1.png\nCrystal Clear Concept Art - Lekmet 8.png\nCrystal Clear Concept Art - Lekmet 7.png\nCrystal Clear Concept Art - Lekmet 6.png\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*{{Interwiki|https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/star-and-the-forces-of-evil/images/6/64/Favicon.ico|starvstheforcesofevil|Lekmet|Star vs. the Forces of Evil Wiki}}\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Star vs. the Forces of Evil}}\n[[Category:Star vs. the Forces of Evil characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Goats]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
