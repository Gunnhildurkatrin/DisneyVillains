She is a\u00a0[[Gargoyle (creature)|gargoyle]] member of the [[Mayan Clan]]. Her name is derived from the obsidian pendant she wears.\n\n==Background==\n===Physical Appearance===\nObsidiana, like many Mayan gargoyles, has a large crest on her forehead. Her skin coloration is blue and her hair is black. She also has pterodactyl-type wings similar to [[Brooklyn]]'s. Her ear structure is unique among gargoyles seen so far in the series.\n\n==History==\n===Past===\n[[File:Obsidiana.jpg|thumb|250px]]\nObsidiana and the other three pendant-bearers were away from the pyramid in [[1993]] when someone attacked the clan, smashing the sleeping gargoyles and looting the pyramid. When she and the others returned, they vowed never to leave the pyramid unguarded again.\n\n===Present===\nIn [[1996]], Cyberbiotics began to encroach on the Mayan Clan's territory, bringing Obsidiana into direct conflict with them. [[Preston Vogel]] hired [[Jackal]] and [[Hyena (Gargoyles)|Hyena]] to remove the gargoyles by any means necessary. When the [[Avalon]] Travelers arrived, Zafiro enlisted their help in defending their territory.\n\n===Future===\nIn [[2006]], Obsidiana will come to the United States of America, and recovered the [[Mayan Sun Amulet]] from the Manhattan Clan. Obsidiana and [[Zafiro]] will be the biological ancestors of Zafiro II.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.gargwiki.net/Obsidiana Obsidiana]at GargWiki\n\n{{Gargoyles}}\n[[Category:Gargoyles characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Gargoyles]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
