"[[File:Gargoyle.jpg|thumb|250px]]\n\n:''You may be looking for [[Gargoyle (creature)]] from the ''[[Gargoyles]]'' franchise. For the character of the same name from [[Adventures of the Gummi Bears]], see [[Gargoyle (Gummi Bears)|Gargoyle]]!''\n\n'''Gargoyle''' is a rock monster that serves [[Prince Phobos|Phobos]] in the ''[[W.I.T.C.H. (TV series)|W.I.T.C.H.]]'' TV series.\n\n==Biology==\nThe Gargoyle is a giant rock monster who worked for Phobos, protecting and guarding the moats from any rebel that dared to try and sneak into the castle. He is very tall and big, he only has one eye and cannot speak at all. Gargoyle first made his appearance in ''It Resumes'', fighting the [[W.I.T.C.H. (Guardians)|Guardians]] after they rescued [[Will Vandom|Will]] from Phobos.\n\nThe Gargoyle reached through the portal to grab [[Irma Lair|Irma]], and Will quickly closed the portal, chopping his left hand off. He appeared again during ''the Battle of Meridian Plains'' helping the Lurdens and in ''[[The Stolen Heart]]'' during the invasion of the Infinite City.\n\n==The Knights of Vengeance==\n[[File:Knights_of_Vengeance.jpg|thumb|The Knights of Vengeance]]\nWhen Phobos is captured and [[Elyon Brown|Elyon]] becomes the new queen, Gargoyle goes into hiding in one of the cells in Cavigor prison. [[Nerissa Crossnic|Nerissa]] meets up with Gargoyle and convinces him to join the [[Knights of Vengeance]] after she recreates his left hand in a club-boulder weapon.\n\nGargoyle's main job was to smash down any buildings and to carry the other Knights on his head. Gargoyle did very little fighting the Guardians but when he did, he usually failed as he is not very smart.\n\nIn ''[[J is for Jewel]]'' he helps lead the attack on the castle with Phobos, knocking down the gate. Elyon returns from her meditation and defeats Phobos, putting Gargoyle in a cell in the Infinite City. Gargoyle is released again in ''[[X is for Xanadu]]'' when Phobos betrays his oath and releases his minions to attack Meridian and [[Kandrakar]]. [[Raythor]], the former leader of the Knights of Vengeance, convinces Gargoyle to join the Guardians as Phobos has no loyalty, honesty or honor.\n\nGargoyle helps fight for the Guardians in the Battle of [[Kandrakar]] in ''[[Z is for Zenith]]'' and is successful because of his size. When he tries to battle [[Lord Cedric|Cedric]] he is injured badly but continues to fight for good. The Guardians win and Gargoyle becomes a Castle Guard to Elyon, preferring good over evil.\n{{W.I.T.C.H}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:W.I.T.C.H. characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]"
