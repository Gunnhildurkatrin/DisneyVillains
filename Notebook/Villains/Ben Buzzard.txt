Both Ben and Buzz also are similar in motives as they have both tricked their intended victims (Woody in Buzz's debut cartoon \"Wet Blanket Policy\") into signing an insurance policy before trying (and failing) to kill them in order to collect on the policy money. However, Buzz wouldn't appear until 1948 in his aforementioned debut cartoon, five years after Ben in this 1943 Donald Duck short.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\">\n36805.jpg\n36806.jpg\n36808.jpg\n36810.jpg|Ben Buzzard now really determined to kill Donald.\n36813.jpg\nScreen_Shot_2013-05-27_at_11.52.36_AM.png\n36814.jpg\n028-018massa.jpg\n028-017fx.jpg\n028-015weirdeyes.jpg\n028-014devilben.jpg\n028-013skullpupils.jpg\n028-011howdyhowdyhowdy.jpg\n028-008geeching.jpg\n028-007reveal.jpg\n028-005menace.jpg\n028-004take.jpg\n028-002sign.jpg\nMr-duck-gets-wings.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Buzzard, Ben}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Vultures]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Who Framed Roger Rabbit cameos]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]"
