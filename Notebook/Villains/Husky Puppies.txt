"The '''Husky Puppies''' are [[Demon]] and [[Nana (Snow Dogs)|Nana]]'s children from Disney's [[2002]] comedy movie ''[[Snow Dogs]]''. While their parentage is mixed, it's clear that they all take after their husky father. When introducing them, [[Barb]] said her favorite was Demon Jr. The four pups appear at the end of the movie, entering Ted's dentist office along with their mother.\n\n==Puppies:==\n*Avalanche\n*Little Aleutia\n*Chinook\n*Demon Jr.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nSnow-dogs-disneyscreencaps.com-10684.jpg|Avalanche\nFile:Snow-dogs-disneyscreencaps.com-10687.jpg|Little Aleutia\nFile:Snow-dogs-disneyscreencaps.com-10695.jpg|Chinook\nFile:Snow-dogs-disneyscreencaps.com-10699.jpg|Demon Jr.\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n{{Snow Dogs}}\n[[Category:Snow Dogs characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Hybrids]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]"
