She is also the team's talented dancer.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nJune is a brave (though she can easily be frightened), kind, intelligent, and respectable girl. Ballet dancing is her favorite thing to do. She knows a lot of big words and teaches her team and the audience how to dance.\n\n=== Appearance ===\nJune has pale skin, short dark brown hair, and brown eyes. She wears a pink headband, a purple dress with a pink belt, light blue pearl earrings, and red ballet slippers over white socks (as seen in \"[[Show and Tell]]\", which shows her without slippers).\n\n===Friends===\nHer friends are [[Leonardo (Little Einsteins)|Leo]], [[Quincy (Little Einsteins)|Quincy]], [[Annie (Little Einsteins)|Annie]], and [[Rocket (Little Einsteins)|Rocket]]. She also has other friends, but they are not human for example, one of her friends is a\u00a0duckling, another is a little dragon kite.\n\n==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==\nJune made an appearance as a puppet in [[Disney Junior - Live on Stage!]], like the rest of her team, and at the [[Animation Courtyard]] in [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]]. She also appears as a walk-around costume for meets and greets, just like the other Little Einsteins, except Rocket.\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*She is named after famous choreographer June Taylor.\n*Her name was given after the sixth month in the Gregorian calendar.\n*She is Chinese-American\n*It's been said that June may have a crush on Leo, but not much evidence has been presented to support this.\n**in \"[[Ring Around the Planet]]\", June gave Leo a big hug for getting ring back on Saturn.\n**June was always the one to comfort Leo when he gets sad, and he always greatly appreciates it. In addition, Leo would comfort June when she's feeling down.\n**In \u2019\u2019[[The Glass Slipper Ball]]\u2019\u2019, Leo complimented on June\u2019s dancing skills and told her she was the best dancer he knew. This comment made June blush and she couldn\u2019t stop blushing. Leo also complimented on June\u2019s dress that she wore to the ball, which also made June blush.\n\n*In \"[[Ring Around the Planet]]\", it is shown that June is ticklish on her fingers and nose.\n*She is the only ''Little Einsteins'' character who wears jewelry, which are her earrings.\n*She wears the exact same purple tutu dress every day, except for the [[A Little Einsteins Halloween|Halloween episode]] where it changes to black as part of her costume, and in \"[[The Glass Slipper Ball]]\" when she wore a fancy ribbon\u00a0dress for the ball.\n*She has a class where [[The Blue-Footed Booby Bird Ballet|she teaches blue-footed booby birds to do ballet]].\n*In the episode \"[[Show and Tell]]\", she actually wears socks with her ballet shoes.\n*In the episode \"[[The Christmas Wish]]\", June wished for a new pair of ballet boots.\n*She loves space as much as dancing.\n*Her room is yellow with a\u00a0cuckoo clock and lots of toys.\n*Her favorite dance move is a leap.\n*In \"[[I Love to Conduct]]\", she leaped across the water on the backs of whales.\n*She can hear the music in the background, just like the other Little Einsteins.\n*In \"[[Rocket's Firebird Rescue]]\", June was given Dancing\u00a0Power and may have it permanently.\n*In \"[[A Galactic Goodnight]]\", she performs her Sleepy Spin dance every night before she goes to bed.\n\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nGlass Slipper Ball dress 1.jpg\nGlass Slipper Ball dress 2.jpg\nGlass Slipper Ball dress 3.jpg\nJune ballroom dress.jpg|June's ball gown\n100220769-L.jpg\nJune Ballet Pose 1.PNG\nJune Ballet Pose 2.PNG\nJune loses her balance after Rocket hiccuped.png|\"Whoops!\"\nJune witch halloween.JPG\nJune kisses Rocket.JPG\nJune meets Little Dragon Kite.PNG\nFeared June.png\nUnbuckled June.jpg\nJune talking.jpg\nJune Push Dance.jpg\nSuprised June.jpg\nJune sitting on a stool.png|June sitting on a stool in the Dessert Factory\nJoyful June.jpg\nJune hugging Leo.png\nJune wave with Leo.png\nScreenshot 2019-03-14-10-24-41.png\nFile:June.jpg\nFile:A305B187-09DE-4825-8309-42CC6D6DB9F8.png\nLittle Einsteins - June - Render.png\nJune.png\n346488536048211.webp\nDdvkq2b-e82868e0-b420-4227-865a-aa2740c7edf5.png\nBC8D7ECE-F9FA-433F-A4E1-F061BFEFCBB5.png\nDisney+LittleEinsteins.png\nEinsteins.jpg\nLittleEinsteinsSeason2.jpg\nLittle-Einsteins-on-stage-1532736446.jpg\n2009 Little Einsteins.jpg\nMission LITTLE EINSTEINS.jpg\nLittle Einsteins Gallery (21).jpg\nLittle Einsteins Promotional Poster.jpg\nLittleEinsteinsDisneyPlus.jpg\nLittle Einsteins in space.png\nLittle einsteins june 12321.jpg\nJune 2323.jpg\nJune 42312213.jpg\nJune 324234.jpg\nLittle einsteins june 32432.jpg\nJune sitting on a stool with her feet in the air.png|June on the stool while lifting her feet up\nLittle Einsteins Leo and June.jpg\nLittle Einsteins June funny 45.jpg\nLittle einsteins annie june qunicy.jpg\nAngry june.jpg\nA3A98523-F74D-4F9D-819E-1C99DFD4EB60.jpeg|June and Leo\n</gallery>\n\n{{Little Einsteins}}\n[[es:June (Little Einsteins)]]\n[[it:June (Little Einsteins)]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Playhouse Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Little Einsteins characters]]\n[[Category:Dancers]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Ballerinas]]\n[[Category:Deuteragonists]]\n[[Category:Asian characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Astronauts]]\n[[Category:Little Einsteins]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]"
