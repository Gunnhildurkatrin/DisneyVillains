(Metropolis Institute of Time Travel), who by inspiration from the works of [[Jules Verne]] and [[H.G. Wells]], builds a time machine, presenting his invention at venues such as the Visionarium in [[Discoveryland]] and Metropolis Science Center in [[Tomorrowland (Magic Kingdom)|Tomorrowland]].\n\nWith the help of his assistant, [[9-Eye]], Timekeeper was able to transport himself and the guests to different times in Earth's past, present, and future.\n\n=== Development ===\nTimekeeper was designed specifically with [[Robin Williams]] in mind when the attraction was first developed for [[Disneyland Paris]]. However, French officials insisted on it featuring a French dub, resulting in Williams only being heard as Timekeeper when it was brought to the [[Magic Kingdom]].  Timekeeper's design would later be recycled for [[Tom Morrow]] at [[Disneyland]]'s version of [[Innoventions (Disneyland)|Innoventions]].\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n=== [[Skipper Canteen]] ===\nIn the library of the ''[[Jungle Navigation Company|Jungle Navigation Co]]. Ltd. Skipper Canteen'' is a book titled, \"Keeping Time\" by '''Williams''', referencing the character of the Timekeeper.\n\n=== The Timekeeper ===\n\n=== Rockettower Plaza ===\nTimekeeper made a cameo in the show ''Stitch's Supersonic Celebration''.  Here, he alongside 9-Eye and [[Tom Morrow 2.0]] were shown being sold off by RoboMart, a subsidiary of the evil corporation [[X-S Tech]].\n\n== Trivia ==\n\n* The Timekeeper's employers at the Metropolis Institute of Time Travel are likely a reference to the influential [[1927]] German-expressionist science-fiction film ''Metropolis'', directed by Fritz Lang.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nLeVisionarium.jpg\nThe_timekeeper_animatronic.jpg\ntimekeeper and 9-eye.jpg\nle-visionarium-1.jpg\ntimekeeper.jpg\nTM3456.jpg|Timekeeper under maintenance\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n<references />\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Inventors]]\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Character stubs]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Time travelers]]\n[[Category:The Timekeeper characters]]"
