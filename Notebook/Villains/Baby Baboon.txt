He doesn't hold still long to look at Jane's progress and likes her drawing of him so much that he steals it from her, Jane gets it back by tricking him. The baboon cries, not getting its way, prompting his entire family to show up and attack Jane. Running for her life, Jane is soon found by [[Tarzan (character)|Tarzan]] and the two make a thrilling escape, though Jane loses a boot and her parasol in the chase, which the baby baboon has taken along with the drawing that Tarzan ends up grabbing and handing to him as he floats down to the jungle floor.\n\nLater in the film, the baby baboon and the troop come to help Jane and Tarzan fight [[John Clayton|Clayton]]'s thugs off when they threaten to capture the gorillas. The baby baboon (wearing Jane's missing boot as a hat) signals for an attack and his horde chase after the thug who was about to attack Jane. The baby baboon then kisses Jane and follows his horde.\n\n=== ''The Legend of Tarzan'' ===\nThe Baby Baboon makes a few appearances throughout the show like in \"Lost Treasure\" where he played a vital role in warning Tarzan that Rokaf planned to kill him after he got the treasure from him. In \"Hidden World\" he took pictures of himself with Philander's camera, causing him to lose film which caused him to not capture the photos of the dinosaurs as he wanted.\n\n=== ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'' ===\nThe Baby Baboon made a cameo in the second part of the special\u00a0[[Where's Perry?]] There he was\u00a0one of the monkeys that [[Candace Flynn]]\u00a0met in the song ''[[Living with Monkeys]]''.\n\n==Gallery==\n===''Tarzan''===\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nTarzan-disneyscreencaps.com-3678.jpg|The baby baboon on Jane's shoulder\nTarzan-disneyscreencaps.com-3686.jpg|Jane's drawing of the baby baboon\nTarzan-disneyscreencaps.com-3687.jpg|Baby Baboon likes Jane's drawing of him...\nTarzan-disneyscreencaps.com-3717.jpg|... and steals it from her\nTarzan-disneyscreencaps.com-3730.jpg|Jane asks Baby Baboon her drawing back...\nTarzan-disneyscreencaps.com-3731.jpg|... but Baby Baboon refuses...\nTarzan-disneyscreencaps.com-3734.jpg|... as he likes his drawing so much\nRobbbbbbbbbbbbbb666.jpg\nTarzan-disneyscreencaps.com-3752.jpg\nTarzan-disneyscreencaps.com-4133.jpg|Baby baboon starts crying\nTarzan-disneyscreencaps.com-4026.jpg\nTarzan-disneyscreencaps.com-3780.jpg\nTarzan-disneyscreencaps.com-4329.jpg|\"Uh-oh.\"\nTarzan-disneyscreencaps.com-4029.jpg\nTarzan-disneyscreencaps.com-4049.jpg|Baby Baboon gets his drawing back\nTarzan-disneyscreencaps.com-4098.jpg\nTarzan-disneyscreencaps.com-8221.jpg\nTarzan-disneyscreencaps.com-8224.jpg|\"Charge!\"\nTarzan-disneyscreencaps.com-8232.jpg\nTarzan-disneyscreencaps.com-8233.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===''The Legend of Tarzan''===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nBaboon flash photo.png\nFunnybaboo.png\nJeweled baboons.png\n</gallery>\n\n===''Phineas and Ferb''===\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nWPp2 Livin' With Monkeys12.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Tarzan}}\n{{Phineas and Ferb}}\n[[Category:Tarzan characters]]\n[[Category:Monkeys]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:African characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Infants]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Phineas and Ferb characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]"
