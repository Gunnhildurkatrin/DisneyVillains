"[[File:Marcus 3.JPG|thumb|313x313px|Marcus in ''[[Mr. Slicker and the Egg Robbers]]''.]]\n'''Marcus Mouse''' is [[Minnie Mouse]]'s stern father. He is a farmer, and runs the family farm with his wife.\n\nHe first appeared in ''A 'Pot' Shot'', an illustrated Mickey Mouse verse from [[1930]]. He was still unnamed, and shown throwing a pot at Mickey's head while the latter is giving a serenade to Minnie.\n\nHe was first named in ''[[Mr. Slicker and the Egg Robbers]]'' by [[Floyd Gottfredson]], in which he was also depicted as a farm owner for the first time. The eggs of his chicken are being stolen, and because a drought has ruined his family's crops, he is unable to pay the mortgage. [[Mr. Slicker]] offers to help him out of debt, but only if [[Minnie]] agrees to marry him, which she does not want to. However, [[Mickey]] eventually finds out that the egg robbers work for Slicker, and manages to save the day.[[File:Afbeelding1-0.jpg|left|thumb|231x231px|Marcus and [[Mrs. Mouse|his wife]] in ''Boxing Champion''.]]Minnie's parents briefly reappeared in the [[1931]] comic ''Boxing Champion'', also drawn by Gottfredson, listening to Mickey's boxing match by radio.\n\nMarcus could be seen on a portrait in the [[1934]] comic ''In the News ''and appeared in a number of daily strips afterwards.\n\nIn the ''Goofy'' comic ''Sheerluck Goof and the Giggling Ghost of Nottenny Moor'', Miss Minnie's father is captured by [[Pete]]. In this story, Minnie's father had a design that was very different from the one in his classic stories.\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\npapamouse.jpg|Minnie's father's very first appearance.\n813965-marcus mouse3.jpg\nMarcus Mouse.png\n05zwendelaar.jpg|Minnie's father and Mr. Slicker.\nMarcusMouse.png|Marcus in ''[[Mr. Slicker and the Egg Robbers]]''.\nPTDC0034.JPG\nAfbeelding3.jpg|Miss Minnie's father in ''Sheerluck Goof and the Giggling Ghost of Notteny Moor''.\nAfbeelding4.jpg\n</gallery>\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mouse, Marcus}}\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Farmers]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Grandparents]]\n[[Category:Mice]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
