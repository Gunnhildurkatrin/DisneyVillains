She is one of Nicholas Benedict's top agents and very helpful ally to the children.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Personality===\nRhonda has a lighter sense of humor compared to her associates. She can be pretty perky, but is just as serious about her mission as everyone else. She displays a certain fondness for the children and is very supportive of them. She apparently is a good judge of character as she accurately figured that Reynie, Sticky, Kate and Constance would offer a wild solution to her lost pencil test.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nRhonda is a woman of Zambian descent and has a habit of changing her hairstyle to suit the situation; her strangest of all being making her hair green to pose as a student. She also wears bright colorful clothes to accompany her ever changing style.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the original book series, Rhonda Kazmbe was described as being \"above 17\", implying that she is rather young. She is also the adopted daughter of Mr. Benedict.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nRhonda poster.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*[[w:c:mysteriousbenedictsociety:Rhonda Kazembe|Rhonda Kazembe]] at [[w:c:mysteriousbenedictsociety:The_Mysterious_Benedict_Society_Wiki|The Mysterious Benedict Society Wiki]]\n{{The Mysterious Benedict Society}}\n[[Category:The Mysterious Benedict Society]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]"
