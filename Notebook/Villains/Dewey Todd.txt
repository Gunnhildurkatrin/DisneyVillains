Being clumsy and sloppy, he often bumped into people and thus earned the ire of Gilbert, whom he has a rather lukewarm relationship with. Guilt-ridden, he blamed himself for the Halloween incident, later vowing to his grandson that he will \"do something right\", as he wasn't able to perform his duties properly as a porter and elevator operator when he was alive, let alone manage the hotel.\n\nDewey was also initially indifferent if not outright hostile towards Buzzy and Anna. At first, he and the other ghosts warded them off the hotel, wary of any intruders attempting to disturb them. He later lashed out at Buzzy for selfishly profiting from their deaths, bitterly comparing himself and the others to \"zoo animals\" should they be featured in the newspaper, but had a change of heart and jubilantly expressed his optimism when Buzzy and Anna promised to help bring closure to their fates.\n\n=== Pendragon (book series) ===\nDewey Todd is a minor character in ''The Never War,'' the third book of the ''Pendragon'' series by [[D.J. Machale|D.J. MacHale]]. He works as a bellhop and elevator operator at [[The Manhattan Tower Hotel]]. He is shown to have trouble with his job on occasion, and it's implied that he only has a job because his father owns the hotel. Dewey is also mentioned in ''The Pilgrims of Rayne,'' the eighth book of the same series, to have been reported missing after lighting struck The Hollywood Tower Hotel.\n\n==Notes==\n*Dewey is probably the only bellhop in the Tower of Terror who is not consistently portrayed as being malevolent, particularly in the film.\n*In Behind-The-Scenes Video, for the making of; Tower Of Terror's Pre-Show, Dewey is shown wearing a Blue Bellhop Attire, rather than the Burgundy Suit which he wears in the Film as well as other Bellhops in the Attraction. This was likely so it would come out on the Black & White Video of the Twilight Zone Episode.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Dewey Todd and Emeline Partridge.jpg|Dewey and [[Emeline Partridge]].\nFile:Tower of Terror ghosts.jpg|A smiling Dewey along with the four hotel guests.\n</gallery>\n\n{{Tower of Terror}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Todd,Dewey}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Tower of Terror Characters]]\n[[Category:The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror]]\n[[Category:Spirits]]"
