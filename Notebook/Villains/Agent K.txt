Her lips are a peachish color. Her eyelids are a shade or two darker than her skin. Her eyebrows are a very dark brown to a black and are thin. She wears white earrings that look like small white dots or pearls. Her outfit appears to be a solid black suit. It comes down to being a black turtle neck, black figure hugging pants with a black belt, and black slightly high heeled boots. That is her normal attire apart from her enormous array of various disguises. Along with her uniform or what not is a large array of weaponry.\n\n==Background==\nFrom an outside view it may seem she doesn't care for her kids or husband, but in fact she loves them devotedly, even though she may express it through a recording or videotape. If something is done unfairly, she fixes it very quickly. She is seen to be a terrible cook. Her career as a spy has also made her highly suspicious of anything that is the least bit out-of-place, to the point of paranoia. In the episode \"[[Abra K Dabra!]]\", it is revealed that she has stage fright and that her middle name is Mildred. She also has a habit for thinking all her chores are secret missions. She plays classical violin. K once took karate lessons from the evil Master Pho (Master Foe) to bust his secret evil bank-robbing karate gang. Even though she's just as logical as C.A.R., she seems to favor Dick over him. Even though both Dick and Agent K are the replacement adoptive parents, they still seem to be very much in love and care for Riley and Todd as their own children\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the episode \"London Calling\", it is revealed that during her school years at the spy academy, the only class\u00a0she ever failed was cooking.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"185\" captionalign=\"center\">\nAgent K's Bathing Suit.PNG|Agent K's Bathing Suit\nAgentk1.jpg|Agent K with her children Todd and Riley\nAgentk2.jpg|Agent K and her husband Dick\nAgentk3.jpg|Agent K and Riley\nAgentk4.jpg|Agent K with Riley and Todd\nAgentk5.jpg|Agent K taped up in space\n016.PNG\nDick has Something Important to Say.PNG\nTodd & Riley are Missing.PNG\nAgent K still Tanning.PNG\nKmommylove.png|K touched by how her children love her as their real mom\nKlovestodd.png|K hugging Todd\nProudmom.png|K proud of her children for vanquishing [[Dr. Scorpius]]\nB632574C-4BC8-4C00-8BC6-74B1206EF9FE.png\n2EE90D45-2D0D-4F5D-A858-C18D5BCDCF46.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Replacements}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:The Replacements characters]]\n[[Category:Spies]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:English characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Martial Artists]]\n[[Category:Agents]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Articles with Wikipedia content]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]"
