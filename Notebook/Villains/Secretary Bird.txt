His role is to inform his sovereign of the latest news on the island. The recent news is that the soccer match that was supposed to take place has just been cancelled, for the simple reason that there is no arbitrator available. Forced to announce this unfortunate news to his sovereign, the secretary bird ended up suffering the wrath of the King and ended up being ejected from his majesty's tent with a huge roar. The secretary bird, meeting the Fishing Bear who was passing by, asked him what good wind was bringing him. The bear tells him that he has fished humans in the lagoon and that they wish to meet the King. The bird asks that they leave the King alone, not wanting to disturb him for such nonsense. After having initiated the humans in the whole affair concerning the cancelled football(soccer) game, the bird closes the conversation by asking the bear to go and send the humans back to the sea. But [[Professor Emelius Browne]], thinks he has the solution and would like to share his idea with the King about his knowledge of football(soccer). The bird takes him to see the King, and the latter, delighted to hear the professor's words, crowns him arbitrator of the match that is finally going to take place.\n\nThe secretary bird takes the other humans, [[Miss Eglantine Price]], [[Charlie Rawlins|Charlie]], [[Paul Rawlins|Paul]], and [[Carrie Rawlins|Carrie]] Rawlins, to his Highness' royal box to watch the match. When the King arrives on the field, he asks for them to stand up. The secretary bird attends the game until the end after the King and his team have won the game. After the humans had left, the Bird noticed with horror that they had stolen the royal star that the King was wearing, and replaced it with a whistle. The King did not hear it with that ear, but the Bird managed to make him notice it after blowing the whistle. The King was furious, and blamed him in a powerful roar for not having told him earlier, and the roar ended up undressing the Secretary Bird, to the point of finding himself completely naked.\n\n==Trivia==\n*He later made a cameo appearance in ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'' dancing with [[Lady Kluck]] at Fezziwig's.\n*He also had frequent cameos in ''[[House of Mouse]]''.\n*His name is a reference to the real-life [[wikipedia:Secretary Bird|species of bird]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"160\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nSecretary Bird.png|Secretary Bird.\nMickeyschristmascarol5thumb.jpg|Secretary Bird's cameo in ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]''.\nHouse of Mouse 212 Ladies Night - YouTube3.jpg|Secretary Bird as seen in ''[[House of Mouse]]''.\nDo you play Soccer (Football).png|\"Do you know soccer?\"\nFrindley (Sectary Bird).png|Frindley (as his real name).\nFrindley asks his group to stand.png|\"Rise, please.\"\nTumblr n57q3jruwS1rxt9glo8 1280.jpg\nThe bird toots his whistle.jpg|Frindley tooting Leonidas' whistle.
