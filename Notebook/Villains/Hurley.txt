His appearance is kind of cute, but he is greedy with food. He joined [[G-Force (team)|G-Force]] when he met [[Darwin]], [[Juarez]], and [[Blaster]] at the pet shop. His not-so-enemy is [[Bucky (G-Force)|Bucky]] the hamster. Hurley notices a birthmark on Darwin's rump that looks identical to his own and believes that Darwin is his brother, even though he repeatedly denies this to Hurley. He follows Darwin around while overcoming obstacles, such as dogs and the FBI, and helps defeat \"Mr. Yanshu,\" who turns out to be Darwin's former secret agent [[Speckles]]. Hurley's nickname is Rookie, according to the badge that Darwin gives him at the end of the movie from Ben.\n\n{{G-Force}}\n[[Category:G-Force characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Guinea Pigs]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Spies]]\n[[Category:Agents]]\n[[Category:Deuteragonists]]\n[[Category:American characters]]"
