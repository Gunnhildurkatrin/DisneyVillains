'''Experiment 509-A''', is the seedling of [[Sprout]]. Sproutlings float through space on solar wind in order to find objects to cling on to, in hopes of finding a piece of rock or other suitable environment for their roots to grow and continue on their father's legacy (i.e. his original programming).\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Stitch!]]''===\nAlthough [[Sprout]] reappeared in the [[Japan]]ese version of the ''Stitch!'' anime, he makes no appearances in the English dub, where he was mentioned by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] to still live on Kauai. Instead, in both appearances, they are a seedling spawned from Sprout\u00a0called a \"Sproutling\", codename: Experiment 509-A. A seedling first appeared in \"Son of Sprout\", which had attached to a meteor that later crashed\u00a0onto the island. Once it got\u00a0its roots into the ground, it quickly began\u00a0to grow, carrying out his father's original programming, before eventually being neutralized.\n\nAnother Sproutling appears in \"Sprout 2.0\", where it was captured by [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]] and genetically enhanced with the DNA of none other than [[627|Experiment 627]], making the Sproutling super-strong. Luckily, [[Stitch]] and friends were able to stop the Sproutling by utilizing 627's weakness: laughter.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Since the [[Japan]]ese version of ''[[Stitch!]]'' was non-canon when this aired, this experiment is still just [[Sprout]]. However, the English dub attempted to fit the anime into the canon of [[Lilo & Stitch: The Series|the TV series]], and so Sprout stays in [[Hawaii]], whereas instead, both of his appearances are considered to be seedlings that he has spawned.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nscreenCapture 07.04.13 23-17-50.jpg\nscreenCapture 07.04.13 23-18-48.jpg\nscreenCapture 07.04.13 23-27-08.jpg\nscreenCapture 07.04.13 23-31-18.jpg\nscreenCapture 07.04.13 23-33-00.jpg\nscreenCapture 07.04.13 23-40-18.jpg\nscreenCapture 07.04.13 23-41-31.jpg\nscreenCapture 07.04.13 23-42-32.jpg\nscreenCapture 07.04.13 23-49-03.jpg\nscreenCapture 07.04.13 23-50-44.jpg\nscreenCapture 08.04.13 2-05-34.jpg\nscreenCapture 08.04.13 2-06-36.jpg\nscreenCapture 08.04.13 2-09-33.jpg\nscreenCapture 08.04.13 2-11-29.jpg\nscreenCapture 08.04.13 2-11-47.jpg\nscreenCapture 08.04.13 2-12-13.jpg\nscreenCapture 08.04.13 2-13-48.jpg\nscreenCapture 08.04.13 2-49-17.jpg\nscreenCapture 08.04.13 2-50-40.jpg\nscreenCapture 08.04.13 2-51-12.jpg\nscreenCapture 08.04.13 2-52-49.jpg\nscreenCapture 08.04.13 2-55-16.jpg\nscreenCapture 08.04.13 2-55-48.jpg\nscreenCapture 08.04.13 2-56-42.jpg\nscreenCapture 08.04.13 3-04-19.jpg\nscreenCapture 08.04.13 3-05-19.jpg\nscreenCapture 08.04.13 3-06-45.jpg\nscreenCapture 08.04.13 3-07-13.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Plants]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
