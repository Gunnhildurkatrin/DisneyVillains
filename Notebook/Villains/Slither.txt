He is a cobra who guards the secret entrance to Cleocatra's tomb.\n\n==Background==\n===Appearance===\nSlither is a large cobra with dark scales along his back, while\u00a0his head, neck, hood, and the rest of his\u00a0body are\u00a0golden. He has black eyes and\u00a0two black thin stripes on both sides of his hood.\n\n===Personality===\nSlither is the protector of the entrance to the tomb. The cobra is also reliable (Slither promised to help, and helped [[Buddha]] when he was in trouble). Despite this, his character is still very mysterious and not much is known about him, other than the fact that he has\u00a0hypnosis and fire breath abilities.\n\n==Role in the film==\nSlither appears for the first time when the Buddies and [[Babi]] come to the pyramid, wanting to hide from the sandstorm. At the sight of him, Babi escapes (revealing\u00a0his fear of snakes). The Buddies look at how [[Buddha]] approaches the snake\u00a0without fear.\n\nSlither shows himself and says he's here to protect the Cleokatra's tomb. Buddha says that his siblings want to go, but Slither says that Buddha must look him in the eyes. If the snake\u00a0hypnotizes him, it means that Buddha is not a descendant of the Buddasi, and Slither eats\u00a0him. If Buddha hypnotizes\u00a0the snake, he will be considered a descendant of Buddasi, and Slither will let him and his slibings go. Buddha succeeds and manages to hypnotize the serpent. Slither lets them pass, but warns them of the dangers that\u00a0lurk\u00a0ahead. He then illuminates their path with his fire breath.\n\nLater, Slither reappears when Buddha flees in front of the two statue cats. The snake\u00a0hypnotizes the cats and then eats them (off-screen), enabling Buddha to escape.\n\n==Trivia==\n*His name is an obvious reference to the fact that he slithers, as do all snakes.\n*In real life, cobras\u00a0do not breathe fire, nor do they have the ability to hypnotize\u00a0(meaning\u00a0that Slither has supernatural powers).\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nSlither's eyes.PNG|Slither's eyes\nSlither meet Buddha for the first time.PNG|Buddha and Slither meet for the first time\nBuddha hipnotizes Slither.PNG|Buddha hypnotizes Slither\nSlither defeated !.PNG|Slither's defeat\n</gallery>\n\n{{Air Bud}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Air Bud characters]]\n[[Category:Snakes]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Mystical animals]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]"
