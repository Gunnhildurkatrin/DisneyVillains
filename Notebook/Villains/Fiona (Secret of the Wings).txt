She is Dewey's pet lynx. She is voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]].\n\n==History==\nFiona was first seen waking up from her sleep when [[Tinker Bell]] entered her and [[Dewey (fairy)|Deweys']] home, her yawn knocked the tinker off her feet. Fiona later helped her owner save Tink and [[Periwinkle|Peris']] lives before giving them a ride to the border: night had fallen under the Winter Woods and the woods is no place for a warm season fairy. Tinker Bell petted her before she and her sister said their goodbyes, like Dewey she was sad to see Tink leave. \n\nWhen the Pixie Dust Tree was in danger and Tinker couldn't risk exposing her wings in the cold winter air, Fiona gave her a ride back to the tree, with Periwinkle and her friends: [[Gliss]] and [[Spike (fairy)|Spike]] following behind. Fiona was last seen returning to Winter Woods after she dropped the tinker off.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\n938238_450_253.jpg\nsecretofthewings-04.jpg\n942209_1351764037980_500_288.png\nsecretofthewings_tinkerbell_fiona_600-copy.jpg\nsecret-of-the-wings-disneyscreencaps_com-6614.jpg\n</gallery>\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Fiona}}\n{{Disney Fairies}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Disney Fairies characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]"
