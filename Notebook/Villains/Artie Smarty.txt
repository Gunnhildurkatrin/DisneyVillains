"{{Infobox character\n|image = Artie.png\n|voice = Rory Thost\n|shows = ''[[Kim Possible]]''\n|alignment = Neutral\n|family = [[Martin Smarty]] (father)}}'''Artie Smarty'''<ref>http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0398748/</ref> is a minor character from the television show, ''[[Kim Possible]]''. He is voiced by Rory Thost.<ref>http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/Kim-Possible/Artie-Smarty/</ref><ref>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1191277/?ref_=tt_cl_t10</ref>\n\n==Appearance==\nArtie has freckles, wears braces, and varies between silver and gold earrings. He wears a long black shirt and a purple hat with a skull on the front. He also has long light brown hair.\n\n==Personality==\nArtie sees himself as a rebel and tends to resist authority in any form. Despite his tough attitude, he clearly has a deep fondness for animals, and strongly disagrees with the idea of anyone being oppressed by \"the man\". However, this does not prevent him from enjoying the lavish lifestyle that his father's fortune affords him, such as the Bueno Nacho located right beside their pool.\n\n==Abilities==\nArtie is a skilled skateboarder.\n\n==Biography==\nMartin Smarty put Ron Stoppable in charge of his son Artie, in the hopes that Ron would be able to transform Artie from a rebellious kid into a responsible young man. Artie, however, resisted all of Ron's attempts to influence him, and instead took the opportunity to run rampant throughout his father's store. Artie's strong desire to rebel finally proved its usefulness when Dr. Drakken and Frugal Lucre attempted to reprogram the Smarty Mart stockbots into an evil army. Artie refused to allow the robots to be controlled and eventually stole the control unit, halting their rampage and resulting in the capture and arrest of Drakken and Lucre.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Family===\nOnce his father becomes more accepting of the things that make Artie unique, Artie accepts him as well and enjoys skateboarding with him. Artie also does not seem to have a problem with the idea of his father entertaining an unfamiliar woman at home, and instantly calls Shego his new mother upon meeting her.\n\n===Friends===\nThough Artie at first resents Ron and refuses to recognize his authority, he eventually becomes friends with him, due largely to Ron's close relationship with Rufus and Artie's love for animals.\n\n===Enemies===\nWhile Artie had no specific enemies, he identified anyone who attempted to restrict or control him as being in league with \"the man\", and did everything he could to thwart them.\n\n==Paraphernalia==\n===Clothes===\nArtie typically wears a black shirt with a white number 8 on the chest, a purple beanie with a skull on it. Also he wore plaid shorts with black and white Converse style shoes. He also wears red elbow and kneepads while using his skateboard.\n\n==Equipment==\n*Skateboard\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nArtie Smarty Close Up.jpg\nMentorOfOurDiscontent.png\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n<references />\n{{Kim Possible}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Smarty, Artie}}\n[[Category:Kim Possible characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
