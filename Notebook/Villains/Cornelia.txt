Also, Cornelia often makes Spot babysit her friends' eggs. She is voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]].\n\n==Role in the series==\nCornelia is one of the most distinguishable hens on the [[Dearly Farm]], though she is also bossy. She is well known because of the fact that her eggs are typically the largest amongst all the hens on the farm, so she\u2019s come to be idolized due to her innate gift. However, Cornelia also serves as a leader figure amongst the hens and she often makes decisions for the entire coop, though there are some in the coop who disagree with her, especially since they feel she couldn't even raise her own daughter into a proper chicken. Cornelia usually ignores their comments, though despite the fact that Cornelia tolerates Spot's desire to be a dog, Cornelia actually agrees with the hens and she wishes Spot would stop being foolish and behave like a proper chicken. However, she has decided to permit Spot to continue behaving as she has in order to make her happy, though she has set some rules and guidelines that Spot must follow, such as how she must learn some skills that she'll need when she gets older. In her spare time, Cornelia enjoys clucking mindlessly with her fellow chickens and she gossips with some of the other animals around the farm, such as [[Lucy]], as well as Princess and Duchess; though at the end of the day, Cornelia's just happy to sit in her coop with her eggs, as she believes a chicken's duty is to produce the best eggs that one possibly can. Cornelia only wants what's best for Spot.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"185\" position=\"center\">\n3606.jpg\nCornelia and spot.jpg|Cornelia with her daughter Spot\nMotherdaughter.png|Cornelia with Spot, Lucky, Rolly and Cadpig\nRollysEgg-CellentAdventure29.jpg\nRollysEgg-CellentAdventure31.jpg\nRollysEgg-CellentAdventure32.jpg|Cornelia with Cadpig\nMyFairChicken04.jpg\nMyFairChicken06.jpg\nMyFairChicken09.jpg\nMyFairChicken29.jpg\nWildChickChase03.jpg\nWildChickChase05.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{101 Dalmatians}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Chickens]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:101 Dalmatians characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
