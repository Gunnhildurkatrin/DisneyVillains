When he called [[Ratigan]] a rat, he was eaten by [[Felicia]].\n\n==Role in the film==\nBartholomew is an alcoholic. He is constantly seen drinking from a beer mug and becomes disappointed whenever he runs out. During [[The World's Greatest Criminal Mind|Ratigan's song]], when Ratigan dumps a bottle of champagne into his water fountain, Bartholomew gets very excited and immediately runs over to the fountain, where he starts drinking from it. Then Ratigan kicks him and Bartholomew falls and starts swimming around in it. When Ratigan talks about his history with Basil, Bartholomew starts crying about the part that Ratigan never had a moment's peace in mind.\n\nLater, when they are finishing up a verse of the song, he drunkenly says, \"To Ratigan, the world's greatest rat!\", which makes Ratigan very mad (as he despises being called a rat). He throws him outside the hideout and summons [[Felicia]] with a [[Ratigan's Bell|bell]]. However, Bartholomew is too drunk to notice her, and she easily catches and eats him.  Bartholomew starts drunkenly singing the praises to Ratigan, and is swallowed whole just as he is about to call his vengeful boss a rat again. After a short period of mourning from the other henchmen, Ratigan suggests that they finish the song before he has Felicia eat the rest of them, which they do out of fright.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery captional=\"left\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nBillTheLizard-GreatMouseDetective.png\nGreat-mouse-detective-disneyscreencaps.com-1635.jpg\nBartholomewDrinksAtTheFountain.png\nGreat-mouse-detective-disneyscreencaps.com-1762.jpg\nGreat-mouse-detective-disneyscreencaps.com-1775.jpg|Ratigan kicks Bart into the wine fountain.\nGreat-mouse-detective-disneyscreencaps.com-1804.jpg\nGreat-mouse-detective-disneyscreencaps.com-1829.jpg\nGreat-mouse-detective-disneyscreencaps.com-1900.jpg\nGreat-mouse-detective-disneyscreencaps.com-1933.jpg\nBartholomewToRatiganTheWorldsGreatestRat.png|\"To Ratigan, the world's greatest rat!\"\nGreat-mouse-detective-disneyscreencaps.com-1962.jpg|Bart hiccups obliviously as Ratigan advances on him\nBartholomew.jpg\nDontCallRatiganARat.png\nGreat-mouse-detective-disneyscreencaps.com-1999.jpg\nGreat-mouse-detective-disneyscreencaps.com-2013.jpg\nGmd-disneyscreencaps com-2150.jpg|Bart too drunk to notice Felicia right behind him\nFelicaEatsBartholemew.png|Bartholomew's last moments\nDVG Bartholomew.png\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*He was voiced by Barrie Ingham, who also voiced [[Basil of Baker Street]] in the same movie.\n*Bartholomew and [[Ratigan]] are the only characters who die in [[The Great Mouse Detective|''The Great Mouse Detective'']]. It is unknown if [[Fidget the Bat|Fidget]] died too, after he was thrown off into the ocean by Ratigan.\n*He is the only character in the film to have an onscreen death (while [[Ratigan]] also died, but it wasn\u2019t shown onscreen).\n*He is the only [[Thugs (The Great Mouse Detective)|thug]] that wears red (Lavender) in the film (while [[Bill the Lizard]] wears green), and the other thugs were brown and black).\n*It is unknown how he is one of Ratigan's thugs since he called him a rat (although it's implied he only called him that due to being completely drunk).\n\n{{The Great Mouse Detective}}\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Mice]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:The Great Mouse Detective characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Character stubs]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]"
