"[[File:089-012ichy.jpg|thumb|250px]]\n'''Junior''' is a major character in the first act of the short \"[[Reason and Emotion]].\"\n\nHe starts off from the beginning as a toddler, pushing a flower pot off a windowsill and clapping, as he only has [[Emotion]] in his head. Since [[Reason]] is not yet born, Emotion is free to dictate Junior's life, as shown when he has Junior pull a sleeping cat's tail and go downstairs. The results are getting hurt, and then Reason is born, and the battle starts.\n\nWhen Junior grows up, restless Emotion causes him to look at a pretty girl, but Reason forbids him to bother her, and says to maintain proper respect for womanhood. Really insecure, Emotion knocks Reason out with his club and drives Junior to him, and has him ask, \"Hi, babe. Goin' my way?\" (Actually, Emotion says it.) The therefore-offended lady slaps Junior in the face, proving that not listening to Reason can get one in trouble.\n\nHe is never shown again after this.\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"200\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" >\n089-003prints.jpg\nReason and emotion 4large.jpg\nTumblr nhw36zaJNP1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\n089-004fadebrain.jpg\n089-008sideview.jpg\nTumblr ni5mdxASPe1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Reason and Emotion characters]]"
