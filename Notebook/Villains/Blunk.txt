Caleb had a place he was supposed to put the key during his escape so Vathek wouldn't be discovered as a traitor, but Blunk found it and stole it. Blunk went to\u00a0Earth\u00a0with Caleb and the Guardians and quickly made a home there: the Silver Dragon's dumpster. Blunk learned about Earth and constantly took goods from Earth to sell to the Meridianites. In\u00a0[[The Key]], Caleb learned that Blunk had taken the key from its hiding spot, as Vathek had already been suspected by Phobos to be a spy.\n\nCaleb and the Guardians went to Meridian and were able to frame the high-ranking guard of Phobos,\u00a0Raythor, of stealing the key. Vathek was saved but the Guardians and Caleb continued to dislike Blunk. Blunk, being able to sniff out portals, frequently went to Earth and back. Half the time he was in Meridian finding goods, helping the Guardians and selling to customers, and half the time he was in Earth finding goods, helping the Guardians and sniffing out portals for them. Once, Blunk got a cold and was treated by his mother. Bluk always helped Caleb in his missions, and when he was almost eaten by\u00a0Cedric\u00a0and\u00a0Miranda, Caleb demanded a left-behind guard,\u00a0Tynar\u00a0where was his \"friend\". Blunk was so happy at Caleb and from then on sticks to him.\n\nIn\u00a0The Stolen Heart\u00a0Blunk was framed for stealing the\u00a0Heart of Kandrakar, which an evil, greedy Passling named\u00a0Jeek\u00a0had done. He suddenly became an outlaw to them, but decided to prove his innocence. Blunk found a portal to\u00a0Meridian\u00a0and combated Jeek for the Heart, just before it was going to have gone to\u00a0Prince Phobos\u00a0and\u00a0Cedric. The Guardians arrived and helped Blunk, forgiving him. In\u00a0The Final Battle\u00a0Blunk wanted to prove that he was a warrior, not a scavenger and helped fight Cedric with Matt. Meridian was freed but Blunk decided to continue to go to Earth and back. Blunk was one of the many allies of the\u00a0Guardians\u00a0that were summoned to Kandrakar\u00a0to meet The Oracle\u00a0and his Council. Blunk was excited to have found a new world because it meant new items to sell. When the Oracle caught Blunk stealing, he gave Blunk the\u00a0Tooth of the Tonga, allowing him to create folds in the universe to traverse dimensions now that the Veil had been lowered and no more portals existed. In\u00a0B is for Betrayal,\u00a0F is for Facades\u00a0and\u00a0I is for Illusion, Blunk proved useful in sniffing out the\u00a0Knights of Vengeance through the extremely smelly rhino Crimson. He can be easily persuaded into do other people favours in exchange for something else, usually garbage.\n\nIn\u00a0G is for Garbage\u00a0Blunk rediscovered the\u00a0Horn of Hypnos, capable of turning innocent people into mindless transmarchers. Blunk outtraded Jeek\u00a0for it, and used the Tonga Tooth to create a fold to go to Earth to give to the Guardians, but Jeek who had followed him to Earth stole it. Blunk tried to tell\u00a0Irma\u00a0this but Irma was mad at Blunk for putting all his garbage in her parents' garage. Blunk eventually got the message through and when the Knights of Vengeance got ahold of the Horn, they used it to make Jeek,\u00a0Will,\u00a0Matt,\u00a0Taranee,\u00a0[[Cornelia Hale|Cornelia]]\u00a0and\u00a0[[Hay Lin]]\u00a0into Trance Marchers.\n\nIrma had to team up with Blunk to free their friends and avoid hearing the Horn. Blunk took Irma to his secret garbage hideout, but Jeek was able to sniff them out. Blunk tried to remember the tune that broke the spell to the Horn, but couldn't. Eventually the two got along and Irma apologized to Blunk for all the mean things she said to him. In working together, they were able to avoid the spell, destroy the Horn, and free their friends once Blunk remembered the tune.\n\nBlunk continued to be useful in sniffing out villains and being the messenger as shown in J is for Jewel, K is for Knowledge,\u00a0N is for Narcissist, and\u00a0O is for Obedience. Blunk went with the Guardians to\u00a0Zamballa, and helped them battle Nerissa and her\u00a0Knights of Destruction. In\u00a0Q is for Quarry\u00a0Will hired Blunk to spy on her dad's new fiance, Sarina Sanchez, suspecting she may be a glamoured\u00a0Nerissa. Blunk was competent at finding out that Sarina wasn't Nerissa.\n\nBlunk played a major role in\u00a0R is for Relentless\u00a0where he had to help\u00a0[[Hay Lin]] fold to different dimensions, including\u00a0[http://witch.wikia.com/wiki/Earth Earth],\u00a0[http://witch.wikia.com/wiki/Meridian Meridian],\u00a0[http://witch.wikia.com/wiki/Kandrakar Kandrakar]\u00a0and\u00a0[http://witch.wikia.com/wiki/Zamballa Zamballa]to avoid Nerissa getting ahold of\u00a0[[Yan Lin]]. Blunk learned that Nerissa had put a tracking spell on his Tooth, making Yan Lin falling to Nerissa inevitable. Blunk reappears in\u00a0[http://witch.wikia.com/wiki/V_is_for_Victory V is for Victory]\u00a0and\u00a0[http://witch.wikia.com/wiki/W_is_for_Witch W is for Witch]\u00a0where he helps the Guardians try to get\u00a0[http://witch.wikia.com/wiki/Phobos Phobos]\u00a0accustomed to Earth and to defeat\u00a0[[Nerissa Crossnic|Nerissa]]. When Phobos takes siege on Meridian in\u00a0[http://witch.wikia.com/wiki/X_is_for_Xanadu X is for Xanadu]\u00a0both he and Caleb are captured in the Battle of the Infinite City.\n\nBlunk and\u00a0Caleb are sentenced to death by Phobos, but Taranee,\u00a0Will and\u00a0Raythor (now on the good side) are able to free both of them. Blunk goes to Kandrakar where he reunites with his Mama. Blunk participates in the final battle of Kandrakar where he helps Caleb, Gargoyle and\u00a0Sandpit\u00a0defeat\u00a0[[Miranda]]. After that, Blunk returns to Meridian and continues to smuggle.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nBlunk.jpg\nescape from cavigor.jpg\nWalk This Way (2).jpg\nWalk This Way (9).jpg\nHappy Birthday Will (38).jpg\nHappy Birthday Will (41).jpg\nHappy Birthday Will (48).jpg\nBLUNK2.jpg\nHappy Birthday Will (49).jpg\nCaleb Blunk witch.jpg\nG is for Garbage (4).jpg\nG is for Garbage (11).jpg\nW is for Witch (20).jpg\nThe Stone of Threbe (13).jpg\nThe Princess Revealed (6).jpg\nThe Princess Revealed (11).jpg\nThe Ghosts of Elyon (4).jpg\nAmbush At Torus Filney (4).jpg\nUnderwater Mines (16).jpg\n</gallery>\n{{W.I.T.C.H}}\n[[Category:Character stubs]]\n[[Category:W.I.T.C.H. characters]]\n[[Category:Frogs]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]"
