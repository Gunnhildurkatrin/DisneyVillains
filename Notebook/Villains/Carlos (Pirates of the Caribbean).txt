He serves as the mayor or magistrate of Puerto Dorado on the island of [[Isla Tesoro]] when the town was attacked by a [[The Crew of the Wicked Wench|group of pirates]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\nDuring the 18th century in the golden age of piracy, Carlos served as the mayor/magistrate of the Spanish colony Puerto Dorado on Isla Tesoro. Due to his position, Carlos was familiar with the location of the island's [[Cursed Treasure]] which was stored in the Castillo Del Morro fortress. This knowledge however would attract the attention of pirates, namely [[Jack Sparrow|Captain Jack Sparrow]] of ''[[Black Pearl|The Black Pearl]]'', who came to the island with him and Carlos having some affiliation though the nature of it remains unknown.\n\nNot long after the arrival of Jack Sparrow, the island would be attacked by the much more villainous pirates of ''[[Wicked Wench|The Wicked Wench]]'' who were notable rivals of Sparrow's. In their ransacking of Puerto Dorado, one [[Hook Hand Pirate|pirate leader]] would oversee the kidnapping of several politicians including Carlos to interrogate them for the location of the treasure and Jack Sparrow. Carlos would be dunked in a well for information with Carlos' wife pleading with him not to talk.\n\nIt is known that the pirates would make away with the treasure, burn Puerto Dorado and use its remains as a lair. The fate of Carlos and his wife however remain a mystery.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===[[Pirates of the Caribbean (ride)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]===\nWhen the pirates are asking the mayor for treasure, the Hook Hand Pirate interrogates Carlos to know where the treasure is to which Carlos' wife tells her son not to tell the pirates. However, he ends up being dunked into the well despite his innocent protests. In the attraction's revamp to add characters from the film series, the Hook Hand Pirate mentions to know where Jack Sparrow would be at to which Carlos' wife tells her son not to tell the pirates about where Jack Sparrow would be at. Like in the original attraction's script, he ends up being dunked into the well despite his innocent protests.\n\nDue to the success of the attraction at [[Disneyland]], the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction was later built in [[Magic Kingdom]], [[Tokyo Disneyland]], and [[Disneyland Paris]] still featuring the scene where the pirates are interrogating the mayor of Puerto Dorado.\n\n==Other Appearances==\n\n===Film===\n\n====''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]''====\nA deleted scene featured a man being interrogated the same way as Carlos from the original attraction, though Carlos himself did not appear in the film series at all. According to the novelization based on the film's plot, the man was being dunked for sport.\n\n====''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]''====\nLike in the deleted scene for the first film, a man playing the same role of Carlos appears during the scene where Jack Sparrow and his crew arrive at [[Tortuga]]. This scene was recreated from the original attraction where it features a man being interrogated in the same way as Carlos.\n\n===Video Games===\n\n====''[[Kinect Disneyland Adventures]]''====\nCarlos is alluded to by [[Black Barty]] in this video-game, simply being referred to as the '''Mayor of Puerto Dorado'''. His mansion's basement is used to hide [[Blackbeard]]'s treasure which Black Barty and the player steal. This version of Carlos seems to be very deeply connected to pirates, letting Puerto Dorado serve as a pirate-haven for Blackbeard and his crew.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the \"[[Virtual Safari]]\" DVD game released included on Disc 2 of ''[[The Lion King 1\u00bd]]'', [[Pumbaa]] plays the role of Carlos being interrogated into the well while Pumbaa's \"mother\" plays the role of his mother if the viewer chooses the scene where [[Timon]], [[Pumbaa]], [[Timon's Mother|Ma]], and [[Uncle Max]] travel to the parody of the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://pirates.fandom.com/wiki/Carlos Carlos] on [http://pirates.fandom.com/wiki Pirates of the Caribbean Wiki].\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Carlos}}\n{{Pirates of the Caribbean}}\n[[Category:Pirates of the Caribbean characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Mayors]]\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Kinect Disneyland Adventures characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
