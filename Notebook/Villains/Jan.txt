He let Bombay know that Hans had switched places with Jan to see their mother in Scandinavia.

When Gordon woke up he served him and Charlie Hasenpeffer and eggs for breakfast.\n\nWhen Don Tibbles came to talk to Bombay about coaching under Hendricks. Jan encouraged Gordon to round up the Mighty Ducks and leave to the Goodwill Games in LA.\n\nJan, later on witnessed Gordon yelling at Team USA with his \u201cIcelandic\u201d hairdo on the TV.

Jan closed the shop temporarily for the first time in years and traveled to Los Angeles to reinvigorate Gordon\u2019s waning spirit in team USA.
