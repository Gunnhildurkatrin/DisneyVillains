He was Tawni's partner for the trust exercises, so that means he hates Tawni the most because, according to Ms. Bitterman, they have been paired to the person they hate the most. He is considered to be very similar to Tawni as in he is very big on style.\n\nFerguson is from Baton Rouge, [[Louisiana]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*\"Walk a Mile in My Pants\" [First Appearance]\n*\"The Legend of Candy Face\"\n*\"MacKenzie Falls\" - All Minisodes and Season Finale, \"Sword of Mackenzie\"\n*\"Sonny With a Choice\" [Final Appearance]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Michaels, Ferguson}}\n{{Mackenzie Falls}}\n[[Category:Sonny with a Chance Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Mackenzie Falls]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
