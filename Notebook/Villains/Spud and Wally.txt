After Pete realizes they have stolen his house, He (along with Goofy's help) gets the house back. But the crooks escape.\n\nTheir next appearance as the main antagonists, is in \"''[[O, R-V, I N-V U]]''\". They trick Max into giving them a tour of the RV so he could impress Pete as partner. But they steal it and kidnap Max as a hostage. After P.J. rescues Max the crooks are then fought by the two boys. However, they destroy the RV in the process.\n\nTheir final appearance is in \"''[[The Good, the Bad and the Goofy]]''\". After Goofy and Pete defeat them once and for all, they are taken to prison.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Spud and Wally were also used from the characters, [[Jasper and Horace]] in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[1961]] animated feature film, ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]''.\n*They are the most frequent villains in the series. Although Giblet appeared in the same number of episodes, he mostly served as the anti-hero.\n\n==Gallery==\n===The Good, the Bad and the Goofy===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nGooft159-88.jpg\nGooft159-87.jpg\nGooft159-78.jpg\nGooft159-76.jpg\nGooft159-75.jpg\nGooft159-74.jpg\nGooft159-71.jpg\nGooft159-66.jpg\nGooft159-67.jpg\nGooft159-61.jpg\nGooft159-57.jpg\nGooft159-50.jpg\nGooft159-46.jpg\nGooft159-45.jpg\nGooft159-44.jpg\nGooft159-64.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Goof Troop}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Goof Troop characters]]\n[[Category:Weasels]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]"
