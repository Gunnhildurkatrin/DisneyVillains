As a pirate he was rather infamously known as '''Captain Clegg'''. At night he fights injustice as a vigilante known as the '''Scarecrow'''. He was played by [[Patrick McGoohan]].\n\n==Appearances==\nThe Scarecrow is the main protagonist in ''[[The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh]]'' episodes of ''[[Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color]]''. He also technically a film character, as footage from the mini-series was used for a theatrical release in the UK. This cut is called ''Dr. Syn, Alias the Scarecrow''. \n\nThe Scarecrow was revived many years later for comic book story in ''[[Disney Adventures]]'' magazine called ''Enter... the Scarecrow!'', in which he crosses paths with [[Jack Sparrow]]. The scarecrow briefly appears in ''[[The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse]]'' in the episode \"[[Houseghosts]]\" while the [[Lonesome Ghosts (characters)|Lonesome Ghosts]] are channel surfing on Mickey's television.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Live action television ===\n====Photos/publicity====\n<gallery widths=\"200\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nSyn.jpg\nDuality.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n====Screencaps====\n<gallery widths=\"200\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\n1964-epouvantail-2.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*[[w:c:pirates:Christopher_Syn|Christopher Syn]] on [[w:c:pirates:Main Page|Pirates of the Caribbean Wiki]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Syn, Christopher}}\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Captains]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Clergy]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Superheroes]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]"
