In fact, he is Stanley's best friend who gives him learning about animals to help him with his everyday problems, which interest him. He also has to point out the flaws in Stanley's ridiculous solutions. He has musical talent. Occasionally, he is shown to be playing the music for songs featured within the episodes of ''Stanley''. He even breaks the fourth wall in almost every episode by either encouraging the viewers to do something fun or by asking them questions corresponding to the given topic.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Dennis usually spins around before asking questions.\n*Dennis made a cameo in an episode of ''{{WikipediaLink|Pinky Dinky Doo}}''. He can be seen in a fish tank in the pet store.\u00a0[[Harry (Stanley)|Harry]], [[Elsie]], [[Porkchop]], [[Stinky]], and [[Flick Duck]] appear as well. Just like Dennis, Harry and Elsie, the other three characters are from shows that [[Jim Jinkins]]\u00a0has created (''[[Doug]]'' and ''[[PB&J Otter]]'').\n*It is revealed in the episode \"A Boy's Best Friend is His Fish\" that Dennis' breed of fish is a {{WikipediaLink|Comet (goldfish)|Comet}}.\n*In one episode, Dennis explains that rabbits are rodents, which is not exactly real.\n*He has a similar personality to [[Cogsworth]] from ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]''.\n*He wears glasses to read.\n*Dennis is the only one of Stanley's pets mentioned in the show's [[My Man Stanley|theme song]], which asks, \"Who's proud to say his best friend is a fish?\"\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\">\nStanley 1.jpg\ndennis.png\ndennisbowl.png\nDennis (Stanley).jpg\nstanley room.jpg\nYoung Stanley and Dennis.jpg\nGreat Big Book of Everything.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Stanley}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Dennis}}{{DEFAULTSORT:Dennis}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Stanley Characters]]\n[[Category:Fish]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Playhouse Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]\n[[Category:Deuteragonists]]"
