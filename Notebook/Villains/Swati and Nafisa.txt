They are a pair of gaming enthusiasts and patrons of [[Litwak's Arcade]].\n\n==Background==\n<tabber>\nSwati=\n'''Swati''' is a tall, slender pre-teen girl with dark skin, likely indicating that she's of South Asian descent. She has brown eyes and hair, an oval-shaped head, a bulbous nose, and a long neck, as well as a slight gap in her front teeth. She wears a red and white softball jersey, green shorts, socks worn high, and gray shoes.\n|-|Nafisa=\n'''Nafisa''' is shorter than Swati and appears to be of East Asian descent. She has a round head with prominent cheeks, fair skin, green eyes, black hair, and a pug nose. She also wears a blue-gray t-shirt with white polka-dots, purple pants, and the same kind of shoes as her friend.\n</tabber>\n\n==Roles in the film==\nThe two arrive at [[Litwak's Arcade]] and decide to play ''[[Sugar Rush]]'', with Swati at the wheel, playing as [[Vanellope von Schweetz]], and Nafisa rooting her on. Unbeknownst to them, inside the game, [[Wreck-It Ralph (character)|Ralph]] has altered the game's race track in order to help his friend Vanellope bring some spontaneity into her life. As Vanellope steers onto Ralph's track, acting independently of the player, Swati tries to regain control of the wheel, leading to a tug-of-war that ends with Swati accidentally yanking the wheel out of the console.\n\nWhen the two girls bring this problem to Mr. Litwak's attention, he attempts to put the wheel back in, but only succeeds in breaking it in half, leading ''Sugar Rush'' to get unplugged and face being thrown away. Swati searches the internet for a replacement wheel and shows her find to Mr. Litwak, but he says it's too expensive for him, prompting Ralph and Vanellope to journey into the [[Internet]] in order to raise money for the wheel and save ''Sugar Rush'' from being unplugged. Eventually, they succeed.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"185\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nRalph Breaks the Internet 82.png\nRalph Breaks the Internet 180.jpg\nRalph Breaks the Internet 87.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Wreck-It Ralph}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Wreck-It Ralph characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]"
