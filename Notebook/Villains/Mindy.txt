She is a girl living in the city of [[Danville]], and a rival to schoolmate [[Candace Flynn]]. She shows interest in [[Jeremy Johnson]] when asking him to sit next to her under [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]] and [[Ferb Fletcher|Ferb]]'s circus. However, Jeremy does not seem to like her in the same way, as he tells her that he is going to sit next to Candace. (\"[[Jerk De Soleil]]\")\n\nShe is also the first person to see Candace in Goth-styled clothes, after an unwanted switch with [[Vanessa Doofenshmirtz]]. The first thing she does is to take a picture with her phone and send it to all her contacts, stating, \"Wow, fifty replies already!\", despite Candace obviously not wanting anyone to see her. (\"[[Hail Doofania!]]\")\n\n==Appearance==\nMindy has short, blonde hair with a blue hair clip. She wears a green short-sleeved shirt with neon green and yellow swirls on it over a blue long-sleeved shirt and faded pale green leggings. \u00a0\n\n==Appearances and References==\n*\"[[Jerk De Soleil]]\"\n*\"[[Hail Doofania!]]\"\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nMindy flirting with Jeremy.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Phineas and Ferb}}\n{{Template:PF-Wiki}}\n[[Category:Phineas and Ferb characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:European characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
