As he begins the ceremony, [[Scuttle]] along with other birds and sea animals attack Vanessa. The Bishop doesn't even notice and attempts to finish the wedding. His further fate is unknown, though he presumably performed Prince Eric and Ariel's Wedding.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the theatrical version, the Bishop's legs were animated in more detail. This led to some viewers believing that the Bishop's knees were, in fact, an erection, and was meant to be an amusing easter egg geared towards adults. The animators denied this and, to address the controversy, reanimated the Bishop in later releases.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\">\nBishop Close Up.jpg\nVlcsnap-2011-05-14-15h44m34s122.png\nVlcsnap-2011-05-14-15h58m37s99.png\nVlcsnap-2011-05-14-16h23m05s187.png\nLittle-mermaid-disneyscreencaps.com-8186.jpg\nVanessa Wedding.png\nWalt-Disney-Movie-Comics-The-Little-Mermaid-vanessa-from-the-little-mermaid-24150701-2560-1920.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Little Mermaid}}\n[[Category:The Little Mermaid characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Clergy]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]"
