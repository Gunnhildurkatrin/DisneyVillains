An enchanted three-wish wishing whale am I!|Lester the Whale}}\n\n'''Lester the Whale''' is a character from the ''[[Timon & Pumbaa]]'' TV series who appears in the episode \"[[Be More Pacific]]\".\n\n==Appearance==\nLester is a dark blue whale with a white chest and stomach, small eyes, and buttons with holes in them on his head. In addition to that, he wears a white sailor hat.\n\n==Role in the series==\n[[Pumbaa]] finds Lester lying on the beach. Lester tells the warthog that if he doesn't get back in the water, he will become a fishstick from the sun, so Pumbaa saves the whale's life by throwing him back in the water.\n\nLester, who turns out to be an enchanted wishing whale, then offers Pumbaa three wishes, but the warthog says that he doesn't wish for anything. Lester tells him that if he changes his mind, he can return to the beach and call out his name.\n\nAfter [[Timon]] gives Pumbaa a wish, Pumbaa goes back to Lester and tells him that Timon wished for something big and expensive. Lester grants the Statue of Liberty, but that's not what Timon wished for.\n\nPumbaa goes back to Lester and tells him that Timon wished that he were a king. But Lester makes Timon a giant meerkat on the Empire State Building with a helicopter flying around him, just like King Kong.\n\nPumbaa goes back to Lester and tells him that Timon wished that he were a king who lives in a large stony castle from the middle ages, with security systems and a ferocious fire breathing monster with claws and wings that he can defeat. Lester grants that wish and then turns into a human princess and leaves.\n\nLester grants everything Timon wished for, except he granted a chicken instead of a dragon. Also, Pumbaa accidentally tells him that Timon wished that he could not defeat the monster, so Timon is now stuck with an undefeatable chicken.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nLester2.jpg|Lester with Pumbaa.\nPrincess Lester.png|Pumbaa with Lester, in Lester's true form; a pretty young girl (who still retains a deep male sailor's voice), supposedly a princess.\n</gallery>\n\n{{TheLionKingWiki}}\n{{The Lion King}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Whales]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Timon & Pumbaa characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Marine Animals]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Princesses]]"
