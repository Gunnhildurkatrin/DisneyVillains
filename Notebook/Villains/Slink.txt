Slink is a baby sea serpent who lives with his mother in the Never Sea.\n\n==Role in the Series==\nSlink first appeared in the episode \"[[Cubby's Pet Problem]]\" while [[Stormy]] was showing the wonders of the Never Sea to [[Jake (Pirate)|Jake]] and his crew when they reached Cave of Neptune. Slink quickly took a liking to the puny pirate crew, following them back to [[Pirate Island]] much to their surprise. They chase after the baby sea serpent all over the island, until they manage to capture Slink by playing his favorite game, Fetch. While Jake, [[Izzy]], and [[Skully]] prepare [[Bucky (Jake and the Never Land Pirates)|Bucky]] to find Slink's mother, leaving Slink in [[Cubby]]'s care,\u00a0[[Sharky and Bones]] kidnap Slink for [[Captain Hook]], who plans to use Slink as the main attraction of his seaside petting zoo. Quickly leaping into action, Cubby sneaks aboard the [[The Jolly Roger|Jolly Roger]] to rescue Slink, succeeding with the aid of Jake, Izzy, Slink's mother, and a bit of [[Pixie Dust|pixie dust]].\n\n==Episode Appearances==\n*\"[[Cubby's Pet Problem]]\" (First appearance)\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nSlink.png\nSlink01.jpg\nSlink02.jpg\nSlink04.jpg\nSlink05.jpg\nSlink06.jpg\nSlink07.jpg\nSlink08.jpg\nCubby&amp;Slink.jpg\nStormy&Slink-Cubby's Pet Problem.jpg\nSlink&amp;Cubby-Cubby's Pet Problem.jpg\n</gallery>\n{{Jake and the Neverland Pirates}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Jake and the Never Land Pirates characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Marine Animals]]\n[[Category:Sea Monsters]]"
