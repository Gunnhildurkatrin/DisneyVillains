Curiously, she was identified as Ortensia herself back when Ortensia was nameless (despite being a different species) in [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]]' official copyright synopsis.<ref>[[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit: The Search for the Lost Disney Cartoons]]</ref>\n\nFanny was originally supposed to be in ''[[Epic Mickey]]'', but Ortensia ended up being used in her place.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\n\nFanny in Great Guns by 2wiki.jpg|Fanny in ''Great Guns''\nFanny.jpg|As she was to appear in Epic Mickey\nFanny-Oswald-sister.PNG|Fanny as Oswald's sister (Candy House, 1934).\nFile:Oswald and Fanny pictured in \"All Wet\".jpg\n\n</gallery>\n\n==Fanny under Walter Lantz==\nFanny reappears in a 1934 Lantz cartoon, \"Candy House\", and was reworked to be Oswald's sister instead of his love interest.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Mickey Mouse & Friends}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Rabbits]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Nurses]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]"
