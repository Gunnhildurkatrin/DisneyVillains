They are a married couple that are in the realtor business and usually encounter the Greens in one fashion or another.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nDon and Dawn are the overly friendly, yet determined power couple that love to sell and buy land and real estate to people in Big City. Being real estate magnates, their only concern is to make the deal and move on. While they appear to be competent at their job, they are not the brightest people in Big City. They argued over the placement of their names and nearly broke up, but immediately got back together when they were almost hit by [[Cricket Green|Cricket]] and [[Tilly Green]]. They also apparently believe in ghosts and were immediately frightened upon seeing several people wearing simple bed sheets to emulate them.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nDon is light blue and has blond hair that is combed to the left while Dawn is pink with lighter blond hair that is combed to the right. Both wear black suits with red ties, but Don wears slacks while Dawn wears dark purple lipstick and a skirt. Both of them have big smiles with their teeth on full display, but Don has more than Dawn. Even when they are upset or display another emotion, their teeth are still visible.\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*Don is voiced by Shane Houghton, who voices various characters, and Dawn is voiced by Marieve Herington, who voices Tilly Green. In every episode the characters have appeared, neither of them are credited for the roles.\n\n==External links==\n\n*{{Interwiki|https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/countryclub9732/images/6/64/Favicon.ico|bigcitygreens|Don & Dawn|Big City Greens Wiki}}\n\n{{Big City Greens}}\n[[Category:Big City Greens characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
