'''Experiment 523''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]]. He is designed to be a freeze inducer, making mostly ice and snow. As his deep-freeze programming continues, he makes icy blizzards, mile-high snowdrifts, and keeps all leftovers edible for six months. His one true place is making [[Shave Ice]] with [[Dupe]].\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nSlushy is an icy experiment with a one-track mind. He greatly dislikes the heat, but is very short-tempered about this. He is playful and often likes to play with his \"cousins\" by starting snowball fights, though sometimes enjoys messing with his victims by making the ground slippery or freezing something they need. He is known to be aggressive and apparently shares a grudge with [[Splodyhead]] due to his opposing element, but they resolved it in \"[[Spike (episode)|Spike]]\".\n\n===Physical appearance===\nSlushy is an icy blue experiment who appears to be made from ice. Because of this, he has little to no body features aside from limbs, mouth, blue eyes, a blue-green nose, and a few icicles behind his head.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nSlushy's ice breath is able to blast gusts of ice and snow ranging from a simple snow-cone to a massive blizzard. He can also meld weapons with his icy breath, strong enough to repel fire without melting, and freeze plasma blasts into simple clumps of snow. Slushy can also regenerate himself, as after being broken into blocks of ice he immediately reformed.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment 523 was the 523rd genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to make ice and snow but could use these powers to convert areas into frozen tundras.\u00a0523 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai, with 523's pod landing atop a vending machine.\n\nWhen [[Stitch]] shook the vending machine, trying to get a soda, 523's pod fell out and rolled into a nearby storm drain, the sewage activating the experiment. After emerging, 523 then made his way to a [[Kauai Airport|helicopter base]], where he stowed away aboard a helicopter and proceeded to cover the\u00a0entire island in snow.\n\nStitch somehow vandalized the soda machine after it malfunctioned before he and [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] discovered the snowy weather in [[Kokaua Town]]. Stitch was disconcerted by the snow, while Lilo became fascinated\u00a0and\u00a0dragged Stitch [[Lilo's House|home]] to consult [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], who revealed 523 to them.\n\nLater, Lilo and Stitch engaged 523 in battle resulting in 523 freezing Stitch in ice. 523 then attempted to freeze Lilo in ice too until he was blasted into a [[Net Cannon|net]] and captured in a containment orb by [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]]. However, Lilo freed Stitch from the ice with a blaster and they managed to get 523 back from Gantu after a brief struggle. 523, whom Lilo later named Slushy, was then taken back to their house, where Lilo convinced Slushy to cover her residence in more snow for a little winter fun.\n\nAlthough Stitch initially rejected the snow, as it was a form of water, he later joined Lilo outside and did some ice skating and sledding with her. However, while they were busy playing in the snow, Gantu arrived and recaptured Slushy. The former then forced the experiment to cover the island in a massive blizzard and create a protective ice palace for Gantu and [[Reuben|Experiment 625]].\n\nSometime later, Lilo and Stitch traveled to the ice palace to defeat Slushy. They built two snow replicas of themselves as bait, which Gantu blasted, enabling them to sneak past him and Reuben. However, Slushy spotted Lilo and Stitch inside and managed to trap them under four giant icicles. Fortunately, Jumba and [[Pleakley]] arrived with [[Splodyhead]], who took on Slushy.\n\nA long-drawn-out battle ensued between Slushy and Splodyhead, which ended when the former froze the latter into a block of ice. Splodyhead was later freed and blasted a fireball into the sky at the top of Waialeale Peak to clear Slushy's snowstorms,\u00a0while an overthrown\u00a0Gantu came down with a cold.\n\nAfter Slushy was defeated and recaptured, Lilo and Stitch found him a one true place making [[Shave Ice]].\n\nSlushy reappeared in \"[[Elastico (episode)|Elastico]]\" as one of the audience members for Lilo's hula dance.\n\nIn \"[[Angel (episode)|Angel]]\", Slushy was one of the experiments that\u00a0[[Angel]] reverted to evil using her song, causing the former to go on a rampage\u00a0by freezing the town (including Stitch and Pleakley). Later, Slushy and the other\u00a0depraved experiments attacked Stitch aboard a ship, but Angel turned them back to good before they could finish Stitch off. Working together, the experiments were then able to successfully escape the ship with Stitch.\n\nIn \"[[Spike (episode)|Spike]]\", Slushy was one of the experiments in Pleakley's E.A.R.W.A.X. group. When Slushy created and threw a snowball at Pleakley with boredom,\u00a0it accidentally hit Splodyhead and a battle ensued between the two experiments, which ended when Pleakley convinced Slushy and Splodyhead to attempt hugging therapy on each other.\n\nIn \"[[Remmy (episode)|Remmy]]\", Slushy was one of the experiments in Lilo's dream.\n\nSlushy and Splodyhead were seen on a computer screen in \"[[Ace (episode)|Ace]]\", posing as evil creations of Jumba's as\u00a0part of a hoax to fool [[Mortlegax]], the head of E.G.O. industries.\n\nIn \"[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]\", Slushy and [[Dupe]] were seen using their combined powers to sell multiple low-calorie Shave Ice cones that [[Charles and Mary|a couple]] bought and enjoyed. Gantu then attempted to revert the rehabilitated experiments\u00a0to evil\u00a0by playing\u00a0a recording of Angel's song, but due to interference from [[Snafu|Experiment 120]], Gantu's karaoke tape was played instead, much to Slushy and Dupe's humor.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nIn the film's opening, Slushy can be seen with [[Poki]]\u00a0as\u00a0the former\u00a0sells Shave Ice.\n\nLater, the first 624 experiments, including Slushy, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]], and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nSlushy participated in the following battle between the experiments and the\u00a0[[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]] by freezing oncoming waves of Leroys with his ice breath.\n\nHowever, the Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.\n\n===''[[Stitch!]]''===\nSlushy\u00a0made an appearance in the Stitch! anime along with [[Pix]], [[Boomer (Lilo & Stitch)|Boomer]], [[Blowhard]], [[Kixx]], and [[Slugger]] when [[Yuna Kamihara|Yuna]] and [[Stitch]] visited [[Tokyo Disneyland]]. He made\u00a0a second appearance along with [[Sinker]], in which [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]] used both of them to attack a cruise ship that he had lured Stitch onto. Slushy later appeared in the specials: ''Stitch and the Planet of Sand'' and ''Stitch! Perfect Memory''.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*When Slushy is activated, Gantu mentions that the ice and snowfields created by Slushy remind him of his home world. He also mentions that he could use Slushy to \"turn Earth from a sweltering mud ball into something livable.\"\n*Slushy's [[Experiment Pods|pod]]\u00a0color is blue.\n*The [[Experiment Pod Container]] describes Slushy as: \"Experiment 523. Primary function: Freeze inducer.\"\n*In the [[France|French]] dub, his experiment number is 509, a number taken by [[Sprout]], for some unknown reason.\n*Slushy appears to share a grudge with [[Splodyhead]], but they resolved it in \"[[Spike (episode)|Spike]]\".\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
