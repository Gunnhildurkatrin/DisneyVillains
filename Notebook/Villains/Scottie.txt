He is a hyperactive terrier who lives in [[London|Hampstead]] with [[Danny (101 Dalmatians)|Danny]] the Great Dane.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]''===\nAfter [[Pongo]] and [[Perdita]]'s 15 [[Dalmatian Puppies|Dalmatian puppies]] have been stolen by [[Jasper and Horace]], Scottie is one of the first dogs to answer Pongo's message, along with [[Danny (101 Dalmatians)|Danny]], a Great Dane. Scottie asks Danny who was barking. He tells Scottie that it's Pongo and that 15 puppies have been stolen. They both signal the other dogs to form a \"Twilight Bark\" across [[London]] and the message reaches to [[Towser]] at [[England|Suffolk]], who then sends it to his friend, the [[Colonel]]. Afterwards, Scottie isn't seen or even heard of for the rest of the film, but it can be assumed that when the puppies have returned home, he and the dogs realized that it was [[Cruella De Vil|Cruella]] who was behind the 'dognapping' theft.\n\n===''[[101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure]]''===\nHe also appears as a cameo, along with other dogs, during the \"Twilight Bark\" sequence. He is the first dog to pick up the Dalmatian puppies' barks. However, this could possibly be a different terrier, since their human refers to him as a female.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nScottiedog (1).jpg|Scottie in One and Hundred One Dalmatians\nScottiedog (2).jpg|A shocked Scottie\nScottiedog (3).jpg|Scottie about to bark\n101-dalmatians-2-disneyscreencaps.com-5317.jpg|Scottie in ''[[101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure]]''\n</gallery>\n\n{{101 Dalmatians}}\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:101 Dalmatians characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]"
