Green Bat appears for the first time in the story O Morcego Verde, published in the Brazilian magazine Z\u00e9 Carioca # 1217 (March 7, [[1975]]).\n\nJos\u00e9 comes to the idea of \u200b\u200ba superhero when he reads comics about Morcego Vermelho ([[Red Bat]]), the Brazilian popular alter ego of [[Fethry Duck]]. Jos\u00e9 dons a green cape, a red cap, springs under his feet, wearing black glasses, white gloves and a red sweater with a black bat on it, and tries to fight crime. Though the hero is trying to keep his identity secret, everyone in his neighborhood know who he really is. His faithful helper Manuel, carries a fan everywhere behind him, so Jos\u00e9 can wave his cape in an impressive way.\n\nIn late 1994, the story The Knight Debts, in which the character is revised appears. The story, written by Marcelo Cassaro, is partly based on Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, and includes a new origin for Jos\u00e9's alter ego. Since [[1994]] Green Bat wears a costume based on that of Batman, and the storylines are influenced by the adventures of the Dark Knight. The last of the nearly 100 stories in which Green Bat plays a part was published in [[2001]]. None of the stories of this nature has been published in the Netherlands.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nOcca117.jpg\nOcca118.jpg\nOcca119.jpg\nOcca120.jpg\nRedesign based on \"The Dark Knights\".jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Parrots]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Superheroes]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Alternate Forms]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Brazilian characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]"
