Since neither her nor her husband could do the mail route due to her high oil pressure leaving her unable withstand higher altitudes, her son [[Pedro (character)|Pedro]] must fly to Mendoza, [[Argentina]] to do the task. Pedro's mother teaches her son to be safe while on the route from Santiago to Mendoza by avoiding downdrafts, while her husband tells him to stay away from Aconcagua. Pedro then takes flight to do his task.\n\nLater that night, Pedro's parents believe their son is lost during his first flight.
