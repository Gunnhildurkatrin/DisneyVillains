When Alice sits down, the Mad Hatter and March Hare exclaim there is no room. Then the March Hare says how rude it is to sit at a table without being invited and the Dormouse, sleepy-eyed, pops his head out of a yellow teapot and backs him up by mumbling \"Very very very rude indeed\". Next, he is shown when Alice's unbirthday cake explodes. He is flying with an umbrella singing ''Twinkle Twinkle Little Bat''. As he floats down to the table, the Mad Hatter puts his teapot under him and closes the lid. When the Mad Hatter and March Hare ask Alice to explain her adventure, Alice says she was sitting by the riverbank with [[Dinah]] her cat. Then the Dormouse goes on a crazed frenzy shrieking \"Cat cat cat cat cat!\" Everyone helps to apply jam to his nose to calm him down and he goes back to sleep. He is last seen at Alice's trial in his yellow teapot. Before the [[Queen of Hearts]] asks him to give her information in her loud tone of voice the King of Hearts and Card Soldiers warn her to speak quietly. When he is asked he sings \"Twinkle Twinkle Little Bat\" which the Queen of Hearts states is very important information. When Alice says she sees the Cheshire Cat on the Queen of Hearts'\u00a0crown he goes in his crazed frenzy yelling \"Cat cat cat cat cat!\" It is even harder to apply jam to his nose as the Queen of Hearts gets hit on the head and jam splatters in her face. He isn't shown in the final chase scene.\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\nThe Dormouse makes cameo appearances in some crowd shots, popping out of a teapot that is on a table surrounded by ''Alice in Wonderland'' characters.\n\n===''[[Once Upon a Time in Wonderland]]''===\nIn the ''[[Once Upon a Time]]'' spin-off series, the Dormouse is mentioned in the [[Down the Rabbit Hole|first episode]] by the [[White Rabbit]] to have seen a very alive [[Cyrus (Once Upon a Time in Wonderland)|Cyrus]]. However, [[Will Scarlet]] (the [[Knave of Hearts]]) advises [[Alice]] to not believe the statements of the narcoleptic mouse. It turns out that this testimony is a lie of the rabbit, under the order of the [[Red Queen]].\n\n===[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]===\nIn the ''[[Alice in Wonderland (Disneyland attraction)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' dark ride, the Dormouse appears popping his head in and out of a teapot at the [[Magic Kingdom]], [[Disneyland Paris]], and [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] versions.\n\nIn the ''[[Mad Tea Party]]'' attraction, as the teacups spin around, the Dormouse is shown in the middle of the ride popping his head out of a giant teapot.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n{{Alice in Wonderland}}\n{{DisneyTsumTsum}}\n{{Once Upon a Time}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dormouse}}\n\n[[es:El Lir\u00f3n]]\n[[Category:Alice in Wonderland characters]]\n[[Category:Mice]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Once Upon a Time characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
