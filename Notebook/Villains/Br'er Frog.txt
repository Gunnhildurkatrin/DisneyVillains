''[[Song of the South]]''.\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n=== Song of the South ===\nBr'er Frog appeared fishing in this film before getting upset at [[Br'er Rabbit]] when he freed a fish he'd caught and stored in a can.

He was seen smoking a pipe on the ride's first lift-hill, introducing the attraction's story and filling in the niche of Uncle Remus.\n\nBr'er Frog was later seen again within the ride itself, laying atop the back of Br'er Gator as the gator went fishing.  He sang the song ''[[How Do You Do?|How do you do?]]'' during this scene.  He could later be seen again alongside [[Saddlesore Swanson]] later on in the ride, playing a bass. He sang the song Everybody\u2019s got a laughing place with the possums at magic kingdom. For wdw's finale, he sang Zip-a-dee-do-dah with a turkey.\n\n=== [[Mark Twain Riverboat]] ===\nBr'er Frog had a narration segment on the Mark Twain Riverboat in [[Disneyland]] while passing Splash Mountain on the [[Rivers of America]].
