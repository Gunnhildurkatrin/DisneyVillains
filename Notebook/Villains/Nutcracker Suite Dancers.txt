They appear in order of their role in the segment:\n*The '''[[Sugar Plum Fairies]]''', or '''Fairies''', are tiny creatures that have control over nature. They appear in the form of tiny little women with a single color on them according to their abilities, with leathery wings. They are completely naked like the cupids in\u00a0\"[[the Pastoral Symphony]]\".\n* '''Hop Low'''\u00a0and the\u00a0'''Dancing\u00a0Mushrooms''': A group of six small mushrooms of varying sizes, with the smallest being a mushroom named Hop Low. They have Asian-inspired designs, red caps, and white cloaks. Hop Low's name is never mentioned in the program but mentioned in the film's theatrical trailer and also gave to Hop Low the nickname\u00a0''Dopey of the mushrooms''.\n* The\u00a0'''Dancing\u00a0Flowers'''\u00a0are based on the\u00a0blossoms. They play a similar role to that of the Dancing Mushrooms, coming to life due to the fairies' magic.\n* The\u00a0'''Goldfish''' are the only ones who do not strictly dance but swim around accompanied by the music.\n* The\u00a0'''Dancing\u00a0Thistles'''\u00a0and the\u00a0'''Dancing\u00a0Orchids''': These dancers are flowers who take the form of human dancers. The Dancing Thistles take the form of Cossacks and the Dancing Orchids take the form of peasant girls.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Fantasia]]''===\nIn the ''Nutcracker Suite'' segment of the film, the fairies appear to perform the ''Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairies''. The first to perform are the\u00a0Dewdrop Fairies, who make dewdrops in flowers and webs. When they are done, they are followed by the Summer Fairies, who change the season to summer. After they have woken up and gone away, another type, the\u00a0Autumn Fairies, makes the leaves fall and change color. Next are the\u00a0Frost Fairies\u00a0who wake up, and ice the lakes and rivers. The last are the\u00a0Snowflake\u00a0Fairies\u00a0who fall to Earth, making snow. The fairies of summer, autumn, and winter dance the\u00a0''Waltz of the Flowers'', which is the last dance of this segment.\n\nThe next part begins with a charming dance sequence of six mushrooms plus an adorably tiny featured mushroom named Hop Low who is out of step with the rest of the group and steals the show. They are dancing the\u00a0''Chinese Dance''\u00a0with Hop Low always missing steps. The dance ends when the mushrooms resume their inert shape as the lights go out, with Hop Low the last to follow.\n\nThe following group consists of flowers dancing the\u00a0''Dance of the Reed Flutes''. These flowers dance in a river leading by a white flower and make a circle around it. Finally, they all fall from a waterfall and make bubbles.\n\nIn the water, the Goldfish are found dancing, or at least swimming to, the\u00a0''Arabian Dance''. The goldfish, in the beginning, is alone, but later many other different colored fish join in. They jointly finish with tail moves and making bubbles.\n\nIn the final part of the segment, the Dancing Thistles and Dancing Orchids\u00a0perform the\u00a0''Russian Dance''. In the beginning, many thistles with different color series dance together, and after dancing the orchids again with the same colors, and finally, the thistles and the orchids dance in couples as they become flowers.\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\nThe Dancing Mushrooms appear in the episode \"[[Humphrey in the House]],\" where [[Humphrey the Bear|Humphrey]] planned to eat them until [[J. Audubon Woodlore]] discovered the robotic Humphrey that was cleaning [[House of Mouse (night club)|the club]] for the real one.\n\n===Other appearances===\nThe Dancing Mushrooms, Orchids, and Thistles make cameos in\u00a0''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', in the latter group's case they are seen on the wallpaper of a\u00a0[[Toontown]]\u00a0hotel. The Mushrooms also make a cameo in ''[[It's a Small World: The Animated Series]].''\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\n1940-fantasia-3.jpg\nFantasia-1940-05.png\nFantasia (2).jpg\nFantasia-Nutcracker-Suite-1.jpg\nFilm2 3.jpg\nHeart13.png\nFile:Dancing Mushrooms.png|Dancing Mushrooms\n</gallery>\n\n{{Fantasia}}\n[[Category:Fantasia characters]]\n[[Category:Plants]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Dancers]]\n[[Category:Articles with Wikipedia content]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Fish]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]"
