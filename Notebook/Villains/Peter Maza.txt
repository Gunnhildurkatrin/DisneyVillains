He is former police officer at the 23rd Precinct. He is [[Diane Maza]]'s husband and the father of [[Elisa Maza]].\n\n==Background==\nTired of life in [[Arizona]], Peter left his home, against the wishes of his father, Carlos Maza, for [[New York City]] in [[1960]].\n\n==Role in the [[Gargoyles|series]]==\nWhen his daughter Elisa was shot, Peter, his wife Diane Maza, and son [[Derek Maza]] all came to her bedside. When Derek considered leaving the police force, Elisa went to Peter for advice, who shared in her desire that Derek remains in the force. Derek did, however, leave \"the family business\" and became a personal bodyguard and pilot to [[David Xanatos]].\n\nPeter later expresses his concern over the disappearance of his son but is reassured by Elisa. He is reintroduced to his [[Talon|son]], now a mutate, as well as [[Maggie the Cat]], [[Claw]], and [[Fang (Gargoyles)|Fang]].\n\nWhile visiting his daughter, [[Beth Maza]], at Flagstaff University, Peter is confronted by his past in the form of Coyote the Trickster, with whom he has been linked due to a mystical ceremony performed in his youth.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\">\nHug2.jpg\nImagesCAOV54HY.jpg|Coyote the Trickster\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*He resembles his voice actor Michael Horse.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://gargwiki.net/Peter_Maza Peter Maza] at Garg Wiki\n\n{{Gargoyles}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Maza, Peter}}\n[[Category:Gargoyles characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Police officers]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Native American characters]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
