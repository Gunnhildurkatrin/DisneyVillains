The prophecy that which she said in Jasmine's existing nightmare was ice falling through the sky, the Earth moving like an earthquake, light becoming dark as pitch black as the darkest night sky, [[Giant Scorpions|creatures of destruction]] (like legendary giant desert scorpions) bringing forth their wrath and [[Agrabah]] in the future was destroyed.\n\nThe eclipse is ending, and the Ethereal in a long white robe is hovering in the sky. She is wearing a golden mask like the one Jasmine saw in her dream. She begins to descend to the ground, and tells everyone that the day of reckoning for their civilization will bring her judgment upon Agrabah. But [[Iago]] tells her what happens if she doesn't want to see the city, it would be reduced to dust and rubble like the dream that Jasmine saw in the future and her bad dream. Despite the great libraries, art and economy of the city, the Ethereal feels unsatisfied and compared these attributes to the ones from legendary cities that she destroyed.\n\n[[Genie]] turns into a giant golf player, and the Ethereal is in a golf tee and he tries to hit her with a club that protected her from hitting, so Genie breaks into a thousand pieces. [[Aladdin (character)|Aladdin]] tackles her to the ground, and looking at her white robe, which was empty, and she lifts up by herself off the ground, and the robe floats over to it which Aladdin is not denying her.\n\nIn the chaos she ensures, Jasmine saves some children from falling rubble and gets crushed by the rubble itself. This is what the Etheral needed to see to ensure that Agrabah should not be destroyed. At the end, with her arm, the Ethereal brings Jasmine back to life from and restore the city from destruction that she had been made. She tells the lesson to everyone in Agrabah plus Aladdin and the gang, rises back up from the sky, and disappears into thin air.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Presumably, the Ethereal is the only character in the series that is more powerful from [[Chaos]] apart from Fate, as Genie himself is powerless against her. She also is probably that she is the only character in the series that can truly resurrect the dead.\n*The Ethereal is similar to Mamoon-Ra because they both are a mask with a feminine voice that says words of prophecy (The Ethereal say a prophecy to Jasmine, and Mamoon-Ra say a prophecy to Aladdin).\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nAladdin - The Ethereal and X-Shaped Lightning.jpg|The Ethereal and lightning bolts shaped like a letter \"X\".\nAladdin - The Ethereal from a Picture.jpg|The Ethereal with a destroyed city in a picture from a reference book from Jafar's lab\nAladdin - The Ethereal, Jasmine and Sultan in Reflections.jpg|The Sultan, Jasmine and the Ethereal is shown in mirror reflections from the water of a fountain. \"... but art is of no interest to me.\"\nAladdin - The Ethereal, Jasmine, Iago and the Sultan.jpg|Jasmine and the Sultan giving the tour of Agrabah along with the Ethereal.\nAladdin - The Ethereal and Omar.jpg|The Ethereal giving a goblet from Omar to examine from her invisible hand.\nAladdin - The Ethereal and Storm.jpg\nAladdin - The Ethereal Rising Her Arms.jpg|\"My judgment has been made!\" The Ethereal is rising her arms to create a storm.\nAladdin - The Ethereal Waving Left.jpg|The Ethereal waving her left arm to restore destroyed buildings that look great.\nAladdin - The Ethereal Waving Right.jpg|The Ethereal now waving her right arm to restore destroyed buildings.\nAladdin - The Ethereal Rising Again.jpg|The Ethereal's last words before she disappears, \"Remember the lesson learned here today.
