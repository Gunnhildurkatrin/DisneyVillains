He is the benevolent star of the classic [[Litwak's Arcade|arcade]] game ''[[Fix-It Felix Jr. (video game)|Fix-It Felix Jr.]]'', in which he serves as [[Fix-It Felix Jr. (video game)|Niceland]]'s resident handyman and the \"nemesis\" of [[Wreck-It Ralph (character)|Wreck-It Ralph]]. With his trusty [[Magic Hammer|magic hammer]], Felix has the ability to fix and heal any damage or ailment, hence his name. When Ralph leaves the game to pursue the life of a hero, Felix ventures off to find him with the help of [[Sergeant Calhoun]] of ''[[Hero's Duty]]'', whose beautiful \"high definition\" quickly captures Felix's heart.\n\n==Background==\nIn ''[[Fix-It Felix Jr. (video game)|Fix-It Felix Jr.]]'' at [[Litwak's Arcade]], Felix must repair the town's apartment building from the wrath of a hulking man named [[Wreck-It Ralph (character)|Wreck-It Ralph]], using a magic hammer gifted to him by his father. The game sees Felix scaling the building while repairing windows and avoiding obstacles in the form of Ralph's bricks and flying ducks. Felix can receive power-ups from the [[Nicelanders]], such as pies that grant him super speed, protection from falling bricks, and enhances his hammer's magic. Once the building is saved, Felix is gifted with a medal by the Nicelanders, while Ralph is thrown into a puddle of mud below.\n\nAfter hours, Felix is depicted as living in the quaint town of [[Fix-It Felix Jr. (video game)|Niceland]], where he is revered as the town hero and the poster boy for goodness. He is regularly rewarded for his heroism with pies and medals, the latter of which he keeps displayed on the wall of his apartment.\n\n===Official Description===\n:''Felix is the very popular star of ''Fix-It Felix Jr.'' and Niceland's hammer-wielding maintenance man who's beloved by all. When he is not busy fixin' all of Ralph's wreckin', this gold-medal-winning good guy is being showered with kisses, praise, and pies from his tenants. Hardwired for niceness, anything other than being \"The Good Guy\" just doesn't compute.''\n\n===Development===\nIn the earliest stages of the film's development, Felix was actually the protagonist of the story, while Ralph served as a secondary foil. Writer [[Phil Johnston]] believed Ralph was the more compelling character to center a movie around, specifically in terms of character growth; Felix was demoted to a supporting role as a result but remained a prominent figure in the overall story.<ref name=\"Bit\">''Wreck-It Ralph'' Blu-ray and digital: Bit by Bit: Creating the Worlds of Wreck-It Ralph</ref>\n\nInterestingly, Felix was going to accompany Ralph, and later [[Vanellope von Schweetz|Vanellope]], during their travels throughout ''[[Sugar Rush]]'' (then known as ''Candy Hollow''). He assisted the duo in building Vanellope's kart by enduring [[King Candy]]'s various mini-games and was also present when Vanellope introduced Ralph to her home in [[Diet Cola Mountain]]. When with Vanellope, Felix played very much along the lines of a responsible, albeit worrisome parent. Despite the fact that these early sequences played a pivotal role in identifying Felix's character, he was later dropped from a majority of Ralph and Vanellope's adventure, as the filmmakers felt his inclusion may distract from the development of their relationship.<ref name=\"Rich\">''Wreck-It Ralph'' Blu-ray and digital: Alternate & Deleted Scenes (audio commentary)</ref>\n\nThere was also a subplot involving Felix and Ralph, in which the former had fallen in love with [[Sergeant Calhoun]] (a concept that remained in the film), while the latter conceived a lie that claimed Calhoun had mutual feelings.<ref name=\"Rich\" />\n\n===Personality===\nFelix was programmed to be the ultimate \"good guy\". He is charming, warm, gregarious, and well-loved all throughout the arcade, and more specifically, the in-game neighborhood of Niceland. To the Nicelanders, Felix is the definition of goodness and heroism, and in turn, they constantly praise Felix as their noble leader and treat him with the utmost admiration and respect. By the start of the film, Felix has been accustomed to such treatment for thirty years that although his ego has never inflated as a result of this, he was extremely ignorant towards the feelings of Ralph, who received the complete opposite from both the Nicelanders and the arcade denizens. Felix was never downright unkind to Ralph (he felt emotionally comfortable enough with the bad guy to vent about his problems, and even his [[Sergeant Calhoun|romantic relations]]), rather, he simply never took the bad guy's perspective into consideration, simply seeing their roles and treatment as the natural order of their lives as video game characters. He didn't seem too opposed to the idea of Ralph joining their festivities, but was often pressured to turn the bad-guy away, and passively made attempts to do so to avoid confrontations. This proved he was aware of the bad blood amongst heroes and villains in the arcade, and simply sought to avoid it via segregation, whenever possible. Being a product of his time, Felix is also deeply na\u00efve and optimistic to a fault, which can at times make him appear childish and unrealistic.\n\nAfter Ralph embarks on a game-jumping adventure, Felix's heroism is put to the forefront as he takes the matter of returning Ralph home and saving his cabinet into his own hands. Throughout the adventure, he faces trials and tribulations that mirror that of Ralph's own experiences\u2014being rejected, treated like a criminal, and faced with both emotional and physical misfortune. Felix laments his troubled experiences with Ralph and exclaims that the bad guy doesn't know what such treatment feels like, confirming how little he truly knew of his colleague. This would eventually lead the two down a path of mutual understanding, and Felix would immediately compensate for the years of neglect by assisting Ralph in selflessly protecting Vanellope von Schweetz. By the time their adventure is over, Felix is shown to have grown a fondness and appreciation for Ralph, which is solidified by Felix's use of the term \"brother\" when referring to the bad guy.\n\nAnother notable trait of Felix's, and likely an effect of his programming, is how polite and incapable of genuine hatred or vitriol he is, even when he's genuinely furious. When venting to Ralph about the awful day he's had, all he can muster is declaring how \"cross\" he is with him, and is similarly averse to using harsh language, saying \"he doesn't have to do boo\" for him, with apparently even that being harsh by his own standards. \n\nIn the sequel, Felix is shown to be rather impulsive, since he and Calhoun willingly and enthusiastically adopted the Sugar Rush Racers, even though they never once considered having children and were completely inexperienced with parenthood, let alone knew how to care for fifteen children at once. He also seems to have had a warped view of parenting, since he assumed that it basically meant spoiling and loving the child without any bad side effects, which he quickly realized to be wrong after witnessing the Racers rampage around his apartment. This causes him to become stressed, but he conceals it until the end of the film, where he is shown to have (off-screen, in deleted scenes/story content) grown to be a caring and supportive adoptive father to the Racers, now apparently an expert parent given his successful results and Surge\u2019s surprise at his advice.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nFelix is a diminutive man with fair skin, brown hair, and blue eyes. He wears a blue plumber's outfit with a white undershirt, and brown boots and gloves. His cap is also blue and has his initials detailed on it.\n\nLike the other characters from the film, Felix's appearances, mostly clothing, changed throughout character development from wearing overalls to modern plumbers uniform. At first (and it was shown in one of the presentations of the movie's development), he was to wear a yellow shirt with rolled up sleeves and a sightly different utility belt. However, it changed into a blue short-sleeved shirt with a name tag on it and the belt's appearance changed as well. His facial expressions and hairstyle are also very similar to those of his own voice actor, [[Jack McBrayer]].\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Wreck-It Ralph (film)|Wreck-It Ralph]]''===\n[[File:Fix-it-Felix anniversary.png|thumb|250px|Felix at the 30th anniversary party.]]\nIn the video game world of ''[[Fix-It Felix Jr. (video game)|Fix-It Felix Jr.]]'', Felix and the [[Nicelanders]] are celebrating the game's 30th anniversary, though one character is left out purposely: [[Wreck-It Ralph (character)|Wreck-It Ralph]], the villain of the game. During a party on the dance floor, Ralph arrives, and the Nicelanders tell Felix to shoo him away. Felix is nervous to do so, as he doesn't have the heart to turn Ralph away. After an awkward greeting, Felix invites Ralph in, but the Nicelanders are less than amused. The mayor of Niceland, [[Gene]], begins to lose his patience with Ralph, who has been feeling shunned by the Nicelanders because of his role as the bad guy. Felix tries to stop Gene and Ralph's arguing, but the two are too heated in the moment. Ralph is eventually pushed to destroying the anniversary cake, proving Gene right that Ralph is just the \"bad guy that wrecks the building\". Ralph then leaves for ''Tapper's'' in a huff, claiming he was going to find a medal to prove to everyone that he can be a good-guy.\n\n[[File:Wreck-it-ralph-disneyscreencaps.com-2507.jpg.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Felix trying to act natural to cover for Ralph's absence.]]\nThe next morning, a player, [[Moppet Girl]], prepares to play ''Fix-It Felix Jr.'', but Ralph is nowhere to be found, much to Felix's confusion. Felix sneaks off the screen and rushes to Ralph's brick pile home, but Ralph is absent. The Nicelanders begin to panic over Ralph's mysterious disappearance, just as Moppet Girl notifies [[Mr. Litwak]], the owner of the arcade, about the problem. Believing the game to be on the fritz, Litwak plasters an \"out of order\" sign on the cabinet screen, darkening the world of Niceland and throwing the Nicelanders into panic once more, fearing they'll be unplugged without Ralph. An optimistic Felix calms the crowd, believing Ralph may have simply fallen asleep at ''Tapper's'' again, just before receiving a visit from [[List of cameos in Wreck-It Ralph#Gottlieb|Q*bert]], who tells Felix that Ralph has gone to ''[[Hero's Duty]]''.\n\n[[File:640px-Tumblr me8ej2t89h1qim4fgo10 1280.png|thumb|250px|Felix gazing at Calhoun's high definition beauty.]]\nFelix heads off to find him, but when he arrives, he is attacked by the game's lead character, [[Sergeant Calhoun]], and her troopers. Luckily, Felix is able to use his leaping ability to avoid their fire, before being leg swiped by Calhoun. Being held at gunpoint, Felix quickly identified himself before noticing how beautiful Calhoun was in high definition, quickly becoming infatuated with her. Unflattered, Calhoun cuts straight to the point and demands to know his business, to which Felix explains he's searching for his cohort Ralph. Calhoun scoffs at the claims until Ralph soars by inside a shuttle\u2014not alone\u2014but with a baby [[Cy-Bugs|Cy-Bug]], an enemy in ''Hero's Duty''. Felix and Calhoun follow the shuttle to Game Central Station. There, the [[Surge Protector]] tells them that Ralph has blasted into ''Sugar Rush''. Felix doesn't see Ralph blasting into ''Sugar Rush'' with a Cy-Bug as a major problem. However, Calhoun tells him that Cy-Bugs are unable to tell the difference between game time and after hours, meaning they are truly evil. They'll eventually multiply and consume ''Sugar Rush'' before destroying all the other games in the arcade.\n\n[[File:WIR - Tracking the Cy-Bug.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Felix and Calhoun searching for Ralph.]]\nFelix begins to follow Calhoun in, but the sergeant tells Felix to stay put. Despite Calhoun's demands, Felix stands his ground and tells her it's \"his job to fix what Ralph wrecks\". Calhoun eventually agrees to let him join and the duo head off. In ''Sugar Rush'', they find the shuttle that Ralph crash-landed in, but Ralph and the Cy-Bug are nowhere in sight. While searching in the Candy Tree Forest, Calhoun asks why Ralph went AWOL. Felix is clueless to the fact, but feared that Ralph decided to \"go Turbo\". Not understanding, Felix explains to Calhoun that when the arcade first opened, ''[[TurboTime]]'' was the most popular game by far, and [[King Candy|Turbo]], the lead character of the game, enjoyed being the center of attention. However, when a new racing game ''RoadBlasters'' arrived and stole Turbo's thunder, an extremely jealous Turbo game-jumped into the new game and tried to take it over, causing it to crash. As a result, both games were unplugged for good.\n\n[[File:Tumblr mciu2vZcxo1rrie3xo2 1280.png|thumb|250px|Felix rescuing Calhoun.]]\nJust after Felix finishes the story, the branch he and Calhoun are standing on disappears, and the two fall into Nesquik Sand. Felix tries to hop out but to no avail. Despaired, he goes into panic until Calhoun punches him calm. Just then, the living rope-like laffy taffys above them begin to laugh, and the more they laugh, the lower they descend. Per Felix's request, Calhoun repeatedly punches Felix's face, which Felix in turn repeatedly repairs himself with his magic hammer, until the taffys are within reach. Felix grabs hold of Calhoun and one of the taffys, which lifts the two into the air. Calhoun is impressed at Felix's dashing heroism, but the moment is short-lived. The two return to the crashed shuttle, which Felix repairs with his hammer. They fly in the shuttle to have an aerial view of the kingdom, and in during which, Felix loving gazes at Calhoun, with his affections heightened. When he calls her \"one dynamite gal\" as a compliment, Calhoun has flashbacks of her previous relationship and is pained to the point where she lowers the shuttle and orders Felix out. Unbeknown to Felix, \"dynamite gal\" was what Calhoun's deceased fianc\u00e9 had called her before he was eaten by a Cy-Bug on their wedding day.\n\n[[File:Tumblr mk73nmUqhC1qjpgn7o5 1280.png|thumb|left|250px|Felix reconciling with Ralph in the fungeon.]]\nFeeling desolate that Calhoun has rejected his affections, Felix walks toward the [[Sugar Rush Castle|castle]] of [[King Candy]] and asks the king's assistant, [[Sour Bill]], if he had seen Ralph. With Ralph having become a criminal in ''Sugar Rush'', Sour Bill fears that Felix will also become a threat to King Candy's plot, and imprisons the handyman in King Candy's fungeon. While in the fungeon, he attempts to break the window bars with his hammer, but strengthens them instead, making him hopelessly break down sobbing. Just then, Ralph barges into Felix's cell. Though initially overjoyed to see his friend, Felix berates Ralph for his selfish actions. Ralph explains his reasoning for running away, which comes to a surprise to Felix. Beginning to understand how he cannot change who he is, Ralph asks Felix to fix a [[Candy Kart|kart]], the only hope for a little \"glitch\" named [[Vanellope von Schweetz|Vanellope]], and promises that he will never try to be good again if Felix does so. Felix agrees, touched by Ralph's selflessness.\n\n[[File:WIR - The gamers learn the Turbo truth.jpg|thumb|250px|Felix and Ralph looking in shock as King Candy is revealed to be Turbo.]]\nThey rescue the imprisoned Vanellope. Felix, Ralph, and Vanellope rush to the speedway; if she crosses the finish line, she will no longer be a glitch. Just as Vanellope reaches second place, Calhoun arrives and reveals that the Cy-Bug hatchling has grown and hatched hundreds of eggs in the catacombs of the game. As the Cy-Bugs ravage through ''Sugar Rush'', Felix and Ralph protect the finish line. In during which, they witness King Candy attacking Vanellope on the jumbo screen. During their scuffle, Vanellope's glitching causes King Candy to also glitch, revealing himself to be Turbo. Felix's jaw drops as both he and Ralph are shocked and speechless at the sight of this revelation. As Vanellope approaches the finish line after escaping Turbo, more swarms of Cy-Bugs explode from ground. Vanellope's kart is caught in an explosion, which sends her falling off the track, prompting Felix and Ralph to rush to her rescue, though this leaves the finish line vulnerable to the Cy-Bugs. Hopeless, they try to evacuate the game, but glitches cannot leave their games, trapping Vanellope. Felix asks Calhoun if there is any way to save ''Sugar Rush'', to which Calhoun explains that without a beacon, the bugs cannot be stopped.\n\n[[File:WIR - Calhoun kisses Felix.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Felix and Calhoun's first kiss.]]\nRalph quickly formulates a plan to erupt the Diet Cola Mountain volcano, hoping to have its lava eruption act as the beacon. He leaves Vanellope under Felix's protection as he flies off with Calhoun\u2019s hover board. Felix almost goes after Ralph, but many Cy-Bugs arrive as Calhoun tries to stop them. He keeps Vanellope safe by keeping her by his side, holding her hand, and even pulling out his hammer in case a Cy-Bug hurts her as the three watch on anxiously as Ralph is confronted by Turbo, who has turned into a Cy-Bug after being eaten by one. Fortunately, Ralph succeeds in igniting an eruption, which produces the beacon that attracts and vaporizes all the Cy-Bugs, including Turbo, for good. Felix jumps with joy as he congratulates Ralph on saving ''Sugar Rush'', as well as the entire arcade. In his euphoric rush, Felix kisses Calhoun on the cheek, and the sergeant reacts by yanking him up, initially appearing to strangle him, but to Felix's surprise, she returns the kiss. Felix then repairs the finish line with his hammer, allowing Vanellope to cross. When she does, she is revealed to be a princess and the rightful ruler of ''Sugar Rush''.\n\n[[File:Wreck-It Ralph Felix and Calhoun get married.png|thumb|250px|Felix and Calhoun's wedding.]]\nAt that time, the arcade is about to open so Calhoun calls Felix and Ralph to head back to their respective games. Felix and Ralph travel back to ''Fix-It Felix Jr.'' just in time to show [[Mr. Litwak]] that it still works, sparing the game from being unplugged. They invite homeless video game characters such as Q*bert into their game to help out on the bonus levels and also make Niceland a new home for the new characters. Some time later in the epilogue, Felix and Calhoun wed with Ralph serving as Felix's best man and Vanellope as the maid of honor. And this time, Calhoun's troopers were on watch for a potential Cy-Bug attack just in case. During the end credits, Felix and Ralph are shown having various game-jumping adventures with Vanellope and Calhoun.\n\n===''[[Ralph Breaks the Internet]]''===\n[[File:Fix-It-Felix, Jr 2018.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Felix in ''Ralph Breaks the Internet''.]]\nFelix returns for the sequel, with [[Jack McBrayer]] reprising his role. Felix is first briefly in Ralph's narration as he narrates life within [[Litwak's Arcade]], seen fixing Ralph's wrecking. He is later seen when [[Stan Litwak]] installs Wi-Fi in the arcade; Felix and Calhoun appear with the rest of the main cast wondering what has been plugged in.\n\nLater on, when ''[[Sugar Rush]]'', is shut down due to a broken steering wheel, no one will adopt the [[Sugar Rush Racers]], so Felix and Calhoun decide to adopt them. However, [[Surge Protector]] takes them to another room, giving them the advice that raising fifteen children could be hard, with Felix and Calhoun learning that quickly as the racers destroy their home, shocking the couple. Then at Tapper's, Felix joins Ralph feeling stressed about the Sugar Rush racers and guzzles down Vanellope's root beer: causing him to say: \"eee-a, boy\", causing Ralph to think of Ebay as a way to retrieve a steering wheel and save Sugar Rush for Vanellope. Felix, seeing this to be a chance to rid his home of the Sugar Rush Racers, promises to cover for Ralph while he is gone, although he ends up having to pay for all the patrons\u2019 drinks when Ralph mistakenly announces Felix will pay for the tabs. \n\nHe is not seen again until at the end of the film; despite their initial troubles, Felix and Calhoun have managed to reform the young Sugar Rush racers, and are seen cheering their children on in a race, while bragging to Surge about the best way to raise children (which is drowned out by the racing engines). When Ralph is seen hosting other arcade characters at Niceland, he is seen attending, next to Calhoun. After Ralph says goodbye (by phone) to Vanellope, Ralph and Felix go to begin their game.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, Felix is present along with some ''Slaughter Race'' racers performing with Ralph to the tune \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" by Rick Astley. He is briefly shown behind a bar dancing.\n\n===Other appearances===\nBoth Felix and Ralph starred in a commercial promoting ''GameFly'', which briefly showcased the two discovering the options to rent games.\n\nIn the web series ''[[Disney Drive-On with The Muppets]]'', Felix can be seen as artwork on the ''Fix-It Felix Jr.'' game cabinet in several shots.\n\nIn the series finale of ''[[At Home With Olaf]]'', a short of ''Wreck-It Ralph'' featuring Felix and Ralph appears during a montage of heartwarming moments from Disney films playing in [[Olaf]]'s song \"[[I Am with You]]\".\n\n==Printed media==\n===''The Wrecking Party''===\nIn this story, Felix and the [[Nicelanders]] throw a special party in Ralph's honor known as a \"Wrecking Party\". While tending to average party festivities such as cake and socializing, the group also engages in wrecking; with Felix having created a large brick wall specifically to destroy just for the occasion.\n===''Ralph Breaks the Internet: Click Start \u2014 A Select-Your-Story Adventure''===\nFelix appears in the graphic novel. In the story \"Wanted: Temporary Bad Guy\", a midquel set during Ralph's adventure in the Internet, Felix sends out advertisements to other video game villains as a temporary fill-in for Ralph's bad guy position; unfortunately, the bad guys were under the impression that they receive medals, and upon learning the adverse conditions of Ralph's job, all but Calhoun, Zombie, and Sour Bill bail on the auditions. Depending on the reader's choice, Felix and Gene can audition each candidate. After each one fails to capture Ralph's profile, Gene suffers a tantrum over the thought of unplugging, giving Felix the idea to have Gene be ''Fix-It Felix Jr.''<nowiki/>'s temporary bad guy.\n\n==Video games==\n===''[[Wreck-It Ralph (video game)|Wreck-It Ralph]]''===\n[[File:Tumblr mf7ovvVrwt1rwm3fbo5 500.jpg.jpg|thumb|250px|Felix in the video game.]]\nIn the video game, Fix-It Felix is a playable character along with Wreck-It Ralph. Unlike Ralph, who wrecks things, punches Cy-Bugs, climbs ladders, and pushes things; Fix-It Felix uses his hammer to turn the Cy-Bugs back into eggs (because the hammer restores anything to its original glory), can hop once in midair, and can hop wall-to-wall to get to the top. In the beginning cutscene, Ralph reveals that Felix and Calhoun are married and joins Ralph on watching Vanellope in the Random Roster race. When Ralph accidentally drops a Cy-Bug egg into a taffy pool and unleashes an invasion, Felix joins Ralph on a journey to destroy the Cy-Bugs by making beacons in each level. At the end cutscene, Felix, with Calhoun, puts up a sign that said, \"Cy-Bug safety is our priority\" with a picture of a Cy-Bug on it and then returns to his game to keep the gamers happy.\n\n===''[[Kingdom Hearts Union \u03c7]]''===\nFelix appears in the game, as a resident of his homeworld Niceland, a world within Game Central Station. When the [[Heartless]] attack the apartment building, the player scales its floors to defeat them. They eventually encounter Wreck-It Ralph, who battles the player under the assumption that they are \"going Turbo.\" When Ralph is defeated and tossed off the building, Felix arrives and reprimands the player for disrupting their game. Felix explains that only he is allowed to battle Ralph, per their programmed roles as the \"hero\" and \"villain\" of the game. Since the player's interference went unnoticed by the gamer, however, Felix leaves them be to prepare for a party.\n\nLater at the party, Ralph is rebuked for being a villain, angering him to the point of leaving the game. The player takes note of Ralph's leave, and Felix arrives shortly afterward. He explains that the game was celebrating its 30th anniversary, but Ralph had wrecked the party. Felix goes on to explain that Ralph wants to prove that he can be a hero by earning a medal, despite the fact that bad-guys don't win medals. When Ralph visits Cy-Bug Sector in pursuit of a medal, Felix journeyed off to find him.\n\n===Other games===\nFelix appears in ''[[Disney Infinity (series)|Disney Infinity]]'' as a townsperson costume for the Toy Box. He also has his own power disc where each player has a chance to heal themselves. In the sequel, ''[[Disney Infinity: 2.0 Edition]]'', Felix's role is somewhat expanded, and he serves as a Toy Box City builder.\n\nIn ''[[Disney Crossy Road]]'', both Felix in his normal attire and wedding tuxedo appear in the 'Rare' class. Normal Felix has the power to fix things after obtaining cherries.\n\nIn ''[[Disney Magic Kingdoms]]'', Felix (along with his wife Calhoun) are gem characters and can be unlocked 13 days after the Wreck-It-Ralph event.\n\nFelix appears in ''[[Disney Heroes: Battle Mode]]'', acting at first as a fallen hero like the others. He is seen in his infected form in Chapter Four of the campaign where Ralph meets him, however he only prepares to attack the wrecker. Later near the end, Felix tells the heroes to look for Calhoun to find a solution to the problem. Felix is \u200b\u200bunlockable with 20 tokens and his abilities and animations are the same as in the movie.\n\n==[[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Disney Parks]]==\n===[[Disneyland Resort]]===\nIn the [[World of Color#World of Color:Celebrate!|2015 rendition of World of Color]], Felix, alongside Calhoun, appears during the segment celebrating Disney animated films, and more specifically, romance and friendship.\n\n===[[Walt Disney World]]===\nFelix and Ralph were featured in their own segment in the castle show, [[Celebrate the Magic]] at the [[Magic Kingdom]]. The two take part in an 8-Bit life-sized game of Fix-It Felix on [[Cinderella Castle]].\n\nIn the seasonal [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] show, [[Jingle Bell, Jingle BAM!]], Felix and Calhoun briefly appear sharing a kiss during \"The Christmas Song\" segment.\n\n===[[Disney Cruise Line]]===\nIn Vanellope's Sweets and Treats aboard the [[Disney Dream]], Felix has a dessert named after him called \"Fix-It Felix Chocolate Gummy Bear\".\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Felix is the only main character in the film to be seen regenerating after dying (along with a character from ''Hero's Duty'').\n*In Latin, \"Felix\" means \"lucky\" and \"successful\".\n*Felix's name ends with Jr., which means that his father was most likely also named 'Fix-it Felix'.\n*In one scene of the film, Felix mentions [[W:c:mario:Mario|Mario]] during the party; Felix's main inspiration was Mario, Nintendo's mascot.\n*Felix can speak {{WikipediaLink|Q*bert}}ese, although he says it's a little rusty.\n*In ''The Art of Wreck-It Ralph'', it shows changes in Fix-It Felix's appearance from a figure made of measuring rulers to a human wearing overalls to a human wearing a modern plumber's uniform.\n*Fix-It Felix has some facial similarities with his voice actor, Jack McBrayer.\n*Even though Felix wears a short-sleeved blue shirt and carries a golden hammer in the game (and in the film), the film shows that the ''Fix-It Felix Jr.'' game cabinet has pictures of him wearing a yellow shirt and carrying a normal hammer. This was common of arcade games in the early 80s, with game art rarely matching the colors of the in-game graphics.\n*In the junior novelization, when Mary is announcing the Nicelanders' favorite flavors and gets to Felix's, she isn't interrupted by Ralph like in the movie, so she reveals that Felix's favorite flavor is vanilla.\n*Early versions of ''Ralph Breaks the Internet'' had Felix and Calhoun joining Ralph and Vanellope in their journey to the Internet. Despite tweets from the production crew that Felix and Calhoun's marriage would play a large part in the sequel, their screentime was largely cut down. This was partially altered to keep the arcade relevant, runtime reasons, and due to the belief that having too many characters adventuring through the Internet would overwhelm the story.<ref name=\"tap\">{{Cite web|url=https://uproxx.com/movies/ralph-breaks-the-internet-interview/2/|title=An Early, Behind-The-Scenes Look Into The Making Of \u2018Ralph Breaks The Internet\u2019|date=October 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Wreck-It Ralph}}\n{{Disney Infinity}}\n{{Disney Crossy Road}}\n{{DisneyTsumTsum}}\n{{Kingdom Hearts}}\n{{Disney Heroes: Battle Mode}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Felix, Fix-It}}\n[[de:Fix-It Felix Jr.]]\n[[es:Repara-F\u00e9lix Jr.]]\n[[fi:Fixari Felix, Jr.]]\n[[fr:F\u00e9lix Fixe]]\n[[it:Felix Aggiustatutto]]\n[[nl:Fix-It Felix, Jr.]]\n[[pt-br:Conserta Felix Jr.]]\n[[ru:\u041c\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440 \u0424\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0441, \u043c\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0448\u0438\u0439]]\n[[zh:\u963f\u4fee]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Wreck-It Ralph characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Wonderful World of Color]]\n[[Category:Disney Infinity characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Tritagonists]]\n[[Category:Disney Crossy Road characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney Heroes: Battle Mode characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Magic Kingdoms characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Celebrate the Magic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts characters]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Tsum Tsum characters]]"
