Fossils of them are found in geologic formations dating to the very end of the Cretaceous Period (between about 68\u201366 million years ago) in western [[North America]]. This particular Ankylosaurus is showcased in Disney's [[2000]] CGI film ''[[Dinosaur]]''.\n\n==Background==\n===Real-Life Information===\n''Ankylosaurus'' was a large animal by modern standards. The largest known skull measures 64.5 cm (25.4 inches) long and 74.5 cm (29.3 inches) wide. The largest individuals grew up to be 10-11 m (33-36 feet) long, 1.5 m (4.9 feet) wide, and 1.7 m (5.6 feet) tall at the hip.\n\nThe body shape was low-slung and quite wide. It was quadrupedal, with the hind limbs longer than the forelimbs. Although its feet are still unknown, comparisons with other ankylosaurs suggest ''Ankylosaurus'' probably had five toes on each foot. The skull was low and triangular in shape, wider than it was long. Like other ankylosaurs, ''Ankylosaurus'' had small, leaf-shaped teeth, which were the smallest relative to the body size, than in any other ankylosaurid species, and lacked the tooth batteries of the contemporaneous ceratopsid and hadrosaurid dinosaurs. Bones in the skull and other parts of the body were fused, increasing their strength. Ankylosaurus had only one or two natural enemies that shared its habitat; it was contemporary with the famous [[Tyrannosaurus Rex|''Tyrannosaurus Rex'']] and the giant dromaeosaurid ''Dakotaraptor'', both of which might have occasionally tried to prey on ''Ankylosaurus''. As such, its tail club, a weapon of solid bone as wide as a washing machine, was a perfect means of defense against these predators.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Fantasia]]''===\nIn ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' segment, an Ankylosaurus is seen sleeping.\n\n===''[[Dinosaur]]''===\n[[Url]] is an Ankylosaurus who acts somewhat like a dog. He is seen journeying with [[Baylene]] the [[Brachiosaurus]] and [[Eema]] the [[Styracosaurus]].\n\n===''[[Miles from Tomorrowland]]''===\nIn the episode \"[[Dino World]]\", the Callistos discover a planet inhabited by living earth dinosaurs and other Mesozoic reptiles, including a [[Pteranodon]] and Ankylosaurus. The Ankylosaurus is [[Loretta Callisto]]'s favorite dinosaur, which she nicknames \"Angie.\" During their search for Professor Rubicon, Loretta carelessly got to meet a real live Ankylosaurus. However, the Ankylosaurus she found was sleeping, and when it woke up, it got mad and chased Loretta and her family away. Then, it was discovered in \"[[Galactech: The Mystery of the Dinosaurs]]\" that the dinosaurs were rescued by the Builders.\n\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nFantasia-ankylosaurus.png|Ankylosaurus in ''Fantasia''\nDino World 3.jpg|Ankylosaurus in ''Miles from Tomorrowland''\nDino World concept 1.jpg|''Miles from Tomorrowland'' concept\nDino World concept 2.jpg\nAnkylosaurus.jpg|Concept art by Ricardo Delgado\nAnkylosaurus_v_saichania.jpg\nTumblr o6r6ybrAEC1ubtghao2 1280.jpg|An Ankylosaurus in the early concept art design for DINOSAUR\nDisney Dinosaur Concept Art 3.jpg\nDisney Dinosaur Concept Art 2.jpg|Concept art for \u2018\u2019Dinosaur\u2019\u2019 by William Stout. \u201c4th level in the right\u201d.\n25 species concept art for Disney Dinosaur.png\nDisney Dinosaur Ankylosaurus head concept art.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Fantasia}}\n{{Dinosaur}}\n{{Miles from Tomorrowland}}\n[[Category:Dinosaurs]]\n[[Category:Dinosaur characters]]\n[[Category:Fantasia characters]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric animals]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Miles from Tomorrowland characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]"
