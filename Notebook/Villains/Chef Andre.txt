He cares a lot for his daughter but doesn't like it when she invents gizmos because he too once invented something that ended in disaster. Since then he tries to persuade Gwen to just be a kitchen maid and stay away from inventing because he didn't want her to be as humiliated as he'd felt.\n\nHowever, he finally changed the way he saw his daughter's talents when she successfully built a bowl painting machine for Amber's berry banquet. For the first time ever he was proud of her, and she even repaired the pudding-serving invention he originally made, pointing out it had just been missing a screw.\n\nHe's played very minor roles in both Sofia the First: The Curse of Princess Ivy and \"The Littlest Princess\" mostly seen contributing to the parties being planned in them with his spectacular cooking.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Andre is the typical stern father who tries to dissuade his child from goals he deems folly or silly, but in his defense, he was only trying to protect his daughter from the same humiliation he endured\n*He was mentioned by [[Princess Amber|Amber]] in \"[[When You Wish Upon a Well]]\". Although he did not appear in that episode, He appeared in the next.\n*Chef Andre is the third character that Robin Atkin Downes voices in ''Sofia the First'', previously he has done the voice for [[Sir Finnegan]] in \"[[The Silent Knight]]\" and the Fisherman in \"[[Mom's the Word]]\".\n*His voice actor also provided the voice of Cham Syndulla in both Star Wars The Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebel.\u00a0\n\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nGizmo-Gwen-45.png\nGizmo-Gwen-40.png|Father and daughter hug\nGizmo-Gwen-39.png\nGizmo-Gwen-37.png\nGizmo-Gwen-28.png\nGizmo-Gwen-12.png\nGizmo-Gwen-11.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Sofia the First}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Andre}}\n[[pt-br:Chef Andre]]\n[[Category:Sofia the First characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Chefs]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Widows/Widowers]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Inventors]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
