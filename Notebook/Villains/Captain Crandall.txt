He is a young orange-haired boy who lives with his unnamed parents, his sister [[Jean]], and his dog Action. He is fascinated with being a superhero, to the point that he believes that he actually is a superhero who hails from another planet, despite the family resemblance between him and his \"Earth-mom\". When Governor Kevin holds auditions to find a superhero after [[Baron Blitz]] escapes from prison, Crandall offers to take up that position, but not without gathering himself a team. He chooses two of his classmates, [[Skate Lad|Hector Corrio]] and [[Rope Girl|Brenda]], as his teammates for their respective skateboarding and jump-roping skills.\n\nIn battle, Crandall's weapons consist of his yo-yo, boomerang, shield, and utility belt, provided to him by Level 7. In later episodes, it becomes gradually hinted that the alien superpowers he believes to have may in fact be for real. In \"[[Going it Alone!|Going It Alone!]]\", he finds an old superhero suit that apparently belonged to him a long time ago. Furthermore, in \"[[Science Friction!]]\", when he loses his temper with the fact that his favorite hangout, the Out of This World Cafe and Museum of the Unknown, is being attacked by what appear to be aliens, his skin turns purple as an apparent result. Finally, in \"[[The Gauntlet's New Gloves!]]\", Crandall manages to lift up the Lobster of Liberty when the Gauntlet attempts to squish him and his teammates under it, and then catches the Gauntlet's energy blasts in his own hands and fires them back at him. Phil Walsh confirmed in an interview that, in later episodes had the show continued, Crandall would've temporarily left the team to find out more about his super powers.\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"209\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" navigation=\"true\">\nCrandall03.jpg|Crandall in his civilian outfit.\nCrandall01.jpg\nCrandallsFamilyPhoto.jpg|Crandall with his family.\nCrandallInPJs.jpg|Crandall in his original super-threads (using his blanket as a cape).\nCrandallBrenda03.jpg|Crandall with [[Rope Girl]] in his arms.\nCrandall is furious.jpg|Crandall in \"furious mode\".\ncrandallbrenda72a.jpg|Crandall and Brenda|link=Teamo Supremo\nLordDruidTiedUp.jpg\nBeholdTheAwesomePowerOfMyStonehenge.jpg\nBaronBlitz2.jpg\nBaronBlitz8.jpg\nDrDroid19.jpg\nTheDentist2.jpg\nTheDentist3.jpg\nTheDentist18.jpg\nTheDentist20.jpg\nCrandallConfrontBirthdayBandit.jpg\n250px-Teamosupremo.jpg|Crandall, [[Skate Lad]] and [[Rope Girl]] \nCaptain Crandall's Alternative Outfit.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Teamo Supremo}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Teamo Supremo characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Superheroes]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]"
