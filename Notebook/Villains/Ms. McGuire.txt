She was voiced by [[Kali Troy|Kittie]]. She only appears once in the entire series, in the episode \"[[Fu and Tell]]\".\n\n==History==\nShe is [[Hayley Long|Hayley]] and [[Olivia Mears|Olivia]]'s homeroom teacher.\n\n==Physical Appearance==\nMs. McGuire is a woman with tan skin and short brown hair. She usually wears a dark purple jacket. She also wears a pink polo shirt, pink pants, black shoes, and a pair of round earrings.\n\n==Personality==\nSince she's rarely seen in the series, not much is known about Ms. McGuire's personality. From what is shown, she is very kind and gentle, especially with children. She speaks with a soft tone and practically never raises her voice. When children in her class are frightened, she will do her best to reassure them as calmly as possible. Because of her tranquil and friendly personality, she is very much appreciated by her students.\n\nHowever, during certain situations, Ms. McGuire knows when to be strict and will not hesitate to hand out warnings. She does not tolerate troublemakers, including pets like [[Yan Yan|Miss Tinkles]], when she bans Olivia's cat from the school.\n\n==Episode Appearances==\n*\"[[Fu and Tell]]\" (only appearance)\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*Although Olivia openly insults Haley during class by calling [[Fu Dog]] a \"stupid dog\", Ms. McGuire doesn't seem to notice. This may hint that she's oblivious to certain things, or that she simply ignores the feud between the two girls.\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nMs_McGuire.png\nFu and Tell (2).jpg\nFu and Tell (6).jpg\nFu and Tell (7).jpg\nFu and Tell (8).jpg\nFu and Tell (9).jpg\nFu and Tell (16).jpg\nFu and Tell (17).jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{American Dragon: Jake Long}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:McGuire}}\n[[Category:American Dragon: Jake Long characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Schoolteachers]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
