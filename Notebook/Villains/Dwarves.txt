They first appear as a cameo in \"[[Nobody's Fu]]\" and make another short appearance in \"[[Magic Enemy Number One|Magic Enemy #1]]\" (both in Season 2), but never take on a large role in the series.\n==Background==\n===Physical Description===\nDwarves, as their name implies, are very short creatures. In general, they do not stand taller than the waist of an average teenager. They have a greyish skin color and pointed ears. They usually wear tunics (for males) or robes (for females), metal or leather arm bracers, belts, fur boots, and sometimes pauldrons. Dwarves always wear a metal horned helmet on their heads.\n==Life in the Magical World==\nBecause Dwarves are seldom seen in the series, their magical powers are unknown. They are usually associated with mining, smithing, and crafting in Norse mythology, which is most probably the same case for the series. They seem to get along well with other magical creatures.\n==Trivia==\n*In \"Nobody's Fu\", a Dwarf was one of the four judges for [[Fu Dog|Fu Dog's]] magical guardian permit exam.\n*In modern popular culture, the most famous Dwarf is Gimli from the ''Lord of the Rings'' trilogy, though [[Snow White]]'s [[:Category:Dwarfs|Seven Dwarves]] are certainly well-recognized around the world.\n{{Template:American Dragon: Jake Long}}\n[[Category:American Dragon: Jake Long characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Dwarfs]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
