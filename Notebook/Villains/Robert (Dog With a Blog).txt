He may represent Stan's self-awareness, to guide him in looking for support.\n\n==Trivia==\n*He wasn't named in ''Freaky Fido'' until it was confirmed in ''Stan Talks to Gran''.\n*Nora's attempted to throw Robert away is what made Stan reveal his secret to her.\n*It's hinted at that he may be able to control himself, as in ''Avery-body Dance Now'', when he moves away to protect himself from Chloe and becomes a cowboy, however, it is evenly likely that Stan is simply controlling him, like he did in ''Stan Runs Away''.\n*He's Stan's chew toy.\n*Stan pretends that he can talk.\n*In ''You're Not My Sister Anymore'', he is shown to have two kids, one girl and one boy, just like Stan.\n*In ''Howloween 2: The Final Reckoning'', Stan and Robert have a costume together.\n\n{{Dog With a Blog}}\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Toys]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Dog with a Blog]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Monkeys]]"
