The robot butler appears in a scene dedicated to the retro-futurism of the early-mid 20th century where it is one of the robotic servants owned by a human.\n\n=== One Man's Dream ===\nOne of the original butler audio-animatronics would be relocated to One Man's Dream in [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] alongside animatronics of [[Figment]], the [[Dreamfinder]]'s dream-mobile, Mr. Broccoli and an anthropomorphic tomato from [[the Colander Combo]] of [[Kitchen Kabaret]].\n\n=== [[Space Mountain (Magic Kingdom)|Space Mountain]] ===\nA different robot appears as the mechanical butler in the post-show sequence of Space Mountain in the [[Magic Kingdom]].  This butler appears in an apartment in the [[Starport Seven-Five|Space Mountain]] offered interstellar tourism destination of Constellation: the city of stars.  The apartment is made to look reminiscent of the, \"Looking back at the future\" apartment from Horizons and while of a different design and holding out drinks rather than vacuuming, the robot butler is most certainly an allusion to that from Epcot.\n\n== Other Appearances ==\n\n=== [[Tales from Adventureland]] ===\nThe ''Tales from Adventureland'' book series is based on several [[Disney Parks]] properties and while most are taken from [[Adventureland]], there are references to other attractions such as Horizons.  In the books, the character of [[Shrunken Ned|Colonel Nedley Lostmore]] is the owner of a robot butler named '''Boltenhouse''' which is inspired by the robot butler from Horizons.  In the later books, Ned begins to use Boltenhouse as a mechanical body after he is magically decapitated and turned into an animate shrunken head.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nEpcot-experience-attraction-poster-horizons-1.jpg|The butler as it appeared on the poster for Horizons\nArtist.jpg|The [[vinylmation]] of the butler from the Park Starz series\n</gallery>{{Space Mountain}}\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Tales from Adventureland characters]]\n[[Category:Space Mountain characters]]\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Servants]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
