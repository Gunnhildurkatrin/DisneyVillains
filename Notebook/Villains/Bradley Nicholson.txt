He acts as Milo's rival and is jealous of the attention he gets whenever something disastrous happens to him, due to Milo being jinxed.\n\n== Personality ==\nBradley often has his doubts when it comes to Milo, and the trail of destruction he leaves behind. He constantly attempts to persuade Melissa into staying away from Milo.\n\nIn ''[[The Undergrounders]]'' he is jealous of Milo and the attention he gets. He also appears to have a slight crush on Melissa, though he attempts to play it cool.\n\n''[[We're Going to the Zoo]]'' reveals that he has a somewhat malicious streak, as shown when he deliberately teased a giraffe by offering it carrots and then withholding them.\n\n== Physical Appearance ==\nBradley is fair-skinned. He has jet black hair with the longer part on one side and wears glasses.\n\nHe wears a gray and white plaid shirt with two pockets, dark gray pants and gray sneakers. He also owns a burgundy colored bookbag.\n\n==''[[Milo Murphy's Law]]''==\n===\"[[Going the Extra Milo]]\"===\nBradley is first seen at a bus stop with his classmates and new student [[Zack Underwood]] waiting on the school bus. When Milo appears, Bradley and his classmates step away from him, but Zack stays where he is, unaware of Milo being jinxed. Bradley along with his classmates and [[Melissa Chase]] go onto the school bus whilst Milo and Zack are chased by a runaway concrete pipe.\n\nDuring the bus journey to school, Melissa makes bets with Bradley and the other students on if Milo and Zack will make it to school before the bell rings. When they arrive in class, Bradley believes that he will win the bet as the bell is about to ring and Milo and Zack are nowhere to be seen. However, Milo and Zack, having been earlier captured by aliens, are beamed down into class just as the bell rings, much to the shock of Bradley.\n\n===\"[[Sunny Side Up]]\"===\nBradley, along with the rest of the class, takes part in an experiment to build a container to place an egg in and drop it from a height and the winner would be the one whose egg doesn't break. He names his team, ''Team Melissa'' in an attempt to get her to join them, much to his teammates' annoyance.\n\nOn the day of the experiment, Bradley drops his egg container and the egg only gets a scratch, making Bradley the first winner. Milo and Zack drop their container \"Big Bertha\", which is knocked away by a truck and bounces around town, before coming back to the school. The egg is undamaged, making Milo and Zack the winners.\n\n===\"[[Rooting for the Enemy]]\"===\nAt the school's gym during practice for the school's football team The Geckos, Bradley wishes to sit next to Melissa, but changes his mind when he notices Milo sitting next to her.\n\nBradley is later seen attending the game between the Geckos and the Tigers, where he tries to convince Melissa to sit next to him and the other students, but she turns the offer down and remains sitting next to Milo.\n\n===\"[[The Undergrounders]]\"===\nBradley and the rest of his class go on the subway on a school trip to a museum.

[[Heinz Doofenshmirtz|Heinz's]] future self, Professor Time, reaches the remaining humans just in time to pick up Orton and defeat Derek in 1955, which turns everything back to normal, aside from Bradley's right arm, which has remained a Pistachion vine.\n\n=== \"[[Snow Way Out]]\" ===\nBradley makes a wager with Melissa to see if Zack and Milo make it to school on time with the loser shoveling out the winner\u2019s driveway. While he initially wins the bet, he loses when the two arrive on time via time travel.\n\n=== \"[[Teacher Feature]]\" ===\nBradley is seen in [[Mrs. Murawski|Ms. Murawski\u2019s]] class when she falls in the sewers to save her desk and is saved by [[Scott the Undergrounder|Scott]].\n\n=== \"[[Pace Makes Waste]]\" ===\nBradley hands out rotten produce to spectaculars to throw at Zack and Melissa for their bad announcing.\n\n=== \"[[Doof's Day Out]]\" ===\nBradley is seen among his classmates at a field trip to the Natural History Museum.\n\n=== \"[[Milo's Shadow]]\" ===\nBradley is seen by a water fountain and sharpening a pencil near a mirror that reads \"What a cute kid\".\n\n=== \"[[Dog Walker, Runner, Screamer]]\" ===\nBradley and Chad are reprimanded by Elliot for throwing a football. Later that day the two play catch with a baseball and Bradley throws the ball to hard when Chad mentions Milo.\n\n=== \"[[Milo's World]]\" ===\nWhen everyone is talking about Milo, Bradley states that Milo can control Murphy's Law and uses it to intentionally cause problems so he can fix them, all so he can look like a hero. He is also bitter about his vine arm.\n\n=== \"[[Ride Along Little Doggie!]]\" ===\nBradley gets jealous when Chad wins 'Greenest Thumb' at the Winter Break Awards, feeling he's entitled to the award since having a literal plant for an arm is close to an actual green thumb as you can get.\n\n=== \"[[Safety First (Milo Murphy's Law)|Safety First]]\" ===\nBradley and [[Amanda Lopez|Amanda]] co-star in Zack and Melissa's film. Amanda quits after being annoyed by Doofenshmirtz's antics, which also causes Bradley to quit.\n\n=== \"[[First Impressions]]\" ===\nBradley misses the bus and gets locked out of school on his first day of first grade due to Murphy's Law.\n\n=== \"[[The Speech and Debate League of Death and Destruction Cross Town Explosion Event]]\" ===\nBradley and Lydia participate on Melissa\u2019s team for The Speech and Debate League of Death and Destruction Cross Town Explosion Event.

Milo suggests they should work on the assignment, but they goof off instead. Bradley is shown to be having fun with the other characters.\n\n== Relationships ==\n\n=== [[Milo Murphy]] ===\nBradley avoids being around Milo as if he is a health hazard. He refuses to be in a close proximity of him and openly berates him for his bad luck. Bradley openly expresses his envy towards Milo over the attention he receives thanks to Murphy's Law.\n\n=== [[Melissa Chase]] ===\nBradley seems to question why Melissa is friends with Milo. He also seems to have a slight crush on Melissa, but tries to play it cool.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Bradley is voiced by [[Vincent Martella]], who previously voiced [[Phineas Flynn]] in ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]''. Coincidentally, both ''Phineas and Ferb'' and ''Milo Murphy's Law'' take place in the same universe.\n**Ironically, Bradley is the opposite of Phineas - while Phineas is an optimist, Bradley is more of a pessimist.\n*In a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ak4i9HZ27o promo] on ''Disney XD Africa''<nowiki/>'s ''YouTube'' channel, it states that Bradley feels he is the perfect soulmate for Melissa.\n*Despite his cold attitude toward Milo, he was seen dancing to him and his band in ''School Dance''.\n*Much like [[Elliot Decker]], his antagonistic relationship with Milo is one-sided on his part.\n*In early concepts, Bradley would have served as the total antithesis of Milo. While Milo was unlucky, but happy all the time, Bradley was going to be incredibly lucky, but miserable about it.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nGoing the Extra Milo 6.jpg\nThe Substitute 6.png\nThe Substitute 4.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Milo Murphy's Law}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nicholson, Bradley}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Milo Murphy's Law characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
