She then asks for a loaf of bread.\n\nNext, she is seen paying [[Baker (Into the Woods)|the Baker]] as he hands her a loaf of bread. She then tells them that she has to leave to go to the woods. The [[Baker's Wife]] asks her is she's certain she knows her way. Little Red Riding Hood states that she knows the way and will certainly be safe. The Baker asks if she plans on buying on the sweets, but the Baker's Wife dismisses it and sends Little Red Riding Hood on her way.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nITW-Wolf and Red Riding Hood.jpg\nLittleRedRidingHood.jpg\nLilla-crawford-is-little-red-riding-hood-and-anna-kendrick-98488.jpg\nTumblr nqse8aXWU31qiceiuo1 1280.jpg\nBakerandCinderellainYourFaultMusicalNumber.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Little Red Riding Hood]] from ''[[The Big Bad Wolf (1934 short)]]''.\n*[[Red (Goldie and Bear)|Red]] from [[Goldie & Bear]].\n\n{{Into the Woods}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Little Red Riding Hood}}\n[[de:Rotk\u00e4ppchen]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Into the Woods characters]]\n[[Category:Those brought back to life]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Orphans]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Character stubs]]"
