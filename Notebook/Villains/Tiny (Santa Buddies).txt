She is an orphaned Yorkshire terrier puppy, and presumably the smallest dog in Fernfield, [[Washington]].\n\n==Role in the film==\nShe first appeared in the alley to avoid getting seen and put in an animal shelter by [[Stan Cruge]]. She finds a loaf of meat from a tipped-over rubbish bin, says grace, and starts eating it. Stan then traps her in a net and takes her to the shelter. She appeared in the shelter when [[Puppy Paws]] gets put in one of the cages. She makes him feel better by telling him how Stan Cruge lost his Christmas spirit, and even sings a song about having a Christmas spirit. Near the end of the film, she gets adopted by Mikey, who was sick and needed a companion.\u00a0\n{{Air Bud}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Air Bud characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]"
