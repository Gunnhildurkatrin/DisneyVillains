He was voiced by animator\u00a0[[Milt Kahl]].\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Ferdinand the Bull]]''===\nAs the titular protagonist of the short, Ferdinand would sit quietly in the shade all day and smell the flowers rather than play with the other calves, much to his mother telling him to play with them. As his mother was understanding, she allowed him to relax in the shade and as the years passed, Ferdinand became older and stronger. As all the other bulls are preparing to fight in Madrid, Ferdinand refuses because all he does all day is smell the flowers in a peaceful moment while sitting near his favorite tree.\n\nUnaware, he accidentally sits on a flower with a bumblebee on it, causing Ferdinand to rampage in an out-of-control behavior; the five men looking for a perfect bull to fight with the matador chose Ferdinand as he would be perfect for the match. Later at the bullring, the matador tries to fight against Ferdinand, but he refuses to fight against his opponent because all Ferdinand did was smell the flowers quietly, much to the matador enraged at him until he tears his shirt open and shows a tattoo in the form of a red flower on his chest which Ferdinand licks and the humiliated matador starts to cry because he can not show what he can do with his cape and sword. As a result, Ferdinand is taken out of the bullring back to his home; Ferdinand happily lives at his favorite corner tree sitting quietly once again.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nFerdinand the Bull film poster.jpeg\nFerd01-big.jpg\n1066245.jpg\nBonkers Do Toons Dream of Animated Sheep Ferdinand the Bull's Cameo.JPG|Ferdinand on ''[[Bonkers]]''.\nFerdinand 4large.jpg\nFerdinand 5large.jpg\nFerdinandthebull.jpg|Ferdinand as a young calf\nFerdinand 7large.jpg\nFerdinand 11large.jpg\nFerdinand 12large.jpg\nMatadortongue.jpg\nMatadorsword.jpg\nFerdinand bull disney.jpg\nFerdinand the Bull 5.jpg\nFerdinand the bull 1large.jpg\nTumblr m0ovp0P3761r3jmn6o1 1280.png\nMl38pop2.jpg\nVlcsnap-2015-07-18-10h54m19s923.png|Ferdinand cel in ''[[The Reluctant Dragon]]''\nMickey And Minnie's Big Vacationgenie3.jpg|Ferdinand in ''[[House of Mouse]]''\nHouse Of Mouse relief.jpg\nFun-fancy-free-disneyscreencaps com-4873.jpg|Ferdinand's cameo in ''[[Fun and Fancy Free]]''\nFerdinand with goofy.jpg|Ferdinand's cameo in \"[[Baggage Buster]]\"\nJuly15th.png|Ferdinand's ''[[Disneystrology]]'' page\nheart9.png\nVlcsnap-2015-01-11-21h25m33s235.png\nTumblr nlshv2is9m1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg|Ferdinand's cameo in ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''\n</gallery>\n\n{{Bonkers}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Silly Symphonies characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Fun and Fancy Free characters]]\n[[Category:Bonkers characters]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Who Framed Roger Rabbit cameos]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Cattle]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]"
