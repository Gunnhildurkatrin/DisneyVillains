They serve as guards and patrolmen in the Palace of the Four Realms.\n\n==Background==\nServing as the guards of the Palace of the Four Realms, Cavalier and Harlequin show their duty as patrolmen of the Palace. When the two encounter Clara and Phillip, they give the two a brief survey to know if they were involved with the Mouse King or not to which after the survey, the two kindly allow them to enter.

While talking to the guards, Phillip explains that Clara is the daughter of Marie to which before the two can allow them to enter, they ask them a few questions to know if they are involved with the [[Mouse King (The Nutcracker and the Four Realms)|Mouse King]] or not to which after a survey, the two are accepted to enter.\n\nThe next day as Clara and Phillip plan on going to the Land of Amusements, Cavalier and Harlequin approach Clara, explaining that they volunteer to help fight against [[Mother Ginger]] and the Mouse King to which the two follow Clara on their way to the Fourth Realm while staying alert for danger. Cavalier and Harlequin arrive at the Fourth Realm to fight against Mother Ginger to only to find out that the Mouse King and his mice begin attacking the army. Cavalier and Harlequin, however, survive the fight.\n\nIt is unknown if they were aware of [[The Sugar Plum Fairy|Sugar Plum]]'s betrayal to the Four Realms, but it is shown that after Sugar Plum's defeat that Cavalier and Harlequin are at Phillip's new post at the Christmas Tree Forest, just as Phillip tells the duo to keep up the good work. However, they are unable to get out of the post by themselves, due to it being jammed with the duo inside.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Cavalier's name was a historical term for supporters of King Charles I while Halequin's name is a reference to a pantomime character, typically masked and dressed in a diamond-patterned costume.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Cavalier.jpg|Cavalier\nFile:Harlequine.jpg|Harlequin\n</gallery><br />{{The Nutcracker and the Four Realms}}\n\n[[Category:The Nutcracker and the Four Realms characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
