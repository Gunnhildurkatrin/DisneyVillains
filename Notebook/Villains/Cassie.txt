"\n[[File:Halloweentown-High-2004-ScreenShot-11.jpg|thumb|250px|Cassie with [[Agatha Cromwell]] ([[Debbie Reynolds]]) in ''Halloweentown High'']]\n'''Cassie''' is a character in ''[[Halloweentown High]]''. She's a witch and one of the transfer students in the film. With the exception of her old friend\u00a0[[Ethan Dalloway]], Cassie is the only one of the transfer students to not need to disguise herself with a magical costume, only wear appropriate clothing for attending a mortal high school.\n\nWhen she first meets [[Marnie Piper|Marnie]] and [[Dylan Piper|Dylan]], the first impression given about her is that she's energetic, inquisitive,\u00a0and a bit dense; she openly asked if they were humans, something that would be a dead give away that she wasn't.\n\n[[Edgar Dalloway]] later sealed her in a Witch's glass to help instigate things by causing a disapearance. Gwen later found and freed her, allowing Cassie to join her friends in the haunted house. Once the [[Halloweentown Council|Council]] decided that there was no threat to [[Halloweentown (place)|Halloweentown]] anymore, Cassie joined everyone at the fair for fun.\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*She is not shown using her powers despite being a witch.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nHalloweentown High Cast.jpg\nMarnie teaching the students.png\nCassie the Witch.jpg\nMarnie and Cassie.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Halloweentown}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Witches]]\n[[Category:Asian characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Halloweentown characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
