They first appear in \"Micro Ducks from Outer Space\" by [[Carl Barks]], and re-appear in \"The Return of the Micro Ducks from Outer Space\" by Edele Kenner and Vicar. They also appear in ''[[DuckTales]]'', but only in the episode \"[[Micro Ducks from Outer Space]]\", based on their first appearance.\n\n==Role in comics==\nIn their debut story, the Micro Ducks come to planet Earth to get corn and wheat. They casually enter the window of [[the Money Bin]] and meet [[Scrooge McDuck]], who, after a moment of uncertainty, becomes fast friends with them and starts some trade exchanges that are profitable for both parties. Only at the end of the adventure, the rich duck realizes the extraordinary experience he lived.\n\nScrooge meets the aliens again in \"The Return of the Micro Ducks\", although it is not the same crew he met in the first adventure.\n\n==Role in ''DuckTales''==\nThe Micro Ducks intercept a signal from a dish made by [[Gyro Gearloose]]. The commander tells Gyro that there is a food shortage on their homeworld and are in need of all the wheat that can be spared. The mothership launches a scout ship, which lands in Scrooge's office. Because of their size, the Micro Ducks need to use a megaphone in order for their voices to be heard. They have a machine called the [[Molecular Manipulator]], which changes the size of any object. They use the machine to enlarge a bunch of gemstones and then to shrink down the grain for transport back home. The Micro Ducks leave their machine behind by mistake, and they fix it up once they find it broken.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\n473392-vlcsnap 01395.jpg|Gyro makes contact with the Micro Ducks.\nep42_A01.jpg\nmicroducks 004.png|\"Maybe ''he'' can tell us where to find them.\"\n473398-vlcsnap 01419.jpg\nVlcsnap-2015-08-21-00h44m20s709.png|The mothership launching a scout ship.\nmicroducks 025.png\nmicroducks 026.png|\"We have scanned your grain.
