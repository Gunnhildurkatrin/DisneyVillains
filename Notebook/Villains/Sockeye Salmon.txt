They are a group of [[Alaska]]n fish that live in the salmon run area, where bears like to eat them.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Brother Bear]]''===\nA group of salmon are seen swimming and jumping along the salmon run area, where many bears catch some to eat. When [[Kenai]] (having been transformed into a bear) gets startled by the other bears towering over him with a salmon in each of their mouths, he screams very loud, causing the other bears to look up and stare at him suspiciously. One bear named [[Tug]] then tells Kenai to stop scaring the fish.\n\nDuring the post-credits, when [[Koda]]\u00a0tells the viewers that \"no fish were harmed during the making of this film,\" one of the salmon is seen being chased by an adult bear, and as the fish\u00a0is screaming for help, Koda covers the camera with his paws so the audience couldn't see the bear eat the salmon, but the fish\u00a0can still be heard getting eaten.\n\n===''[[Brother Bear 2]]''===\nWhen [[Nita]], Kenai, and Koda are at a lake, salmon jump out of the water, causing Nita to become frightened. Koda and Kenai initially laugh, but when Koda keeps teasing poor Nita about the fish being so scary, Kenai angrily tells him to stop. Koda stops teasing Nita, looks at the salmon and says, \"What are you looking at?\" before knocking the fish into the water. As for Kenai, he tells Nita that he and Koda were only kidding about the salmon, but Nita tells Kenai that it's not what scared her. She was actually afraid of the water.\n\n==Trivia==\n*They were based on real-life {{WikipediaLink|Sockeye salmon|sockeye salmon}}.\n*During the post-credits, one of the salmon can be heard talking as he was being chased by a hungry bear. It is unknown which actor voiced this salmon.\n\n{{Brother Bear}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Brother Bear characters]]\n[[Category:Fish]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Canadian characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]"
