Jake and his crew finally return to Mermaid Lagoon with the Fa-La-La water but as Jake was about to hand the bottle to Queen Coralie, Captain Hook swoops in and manages to steal the bottle. This is short-lived as Hook is quickly scolded by his [[Mama Hook|mother]] who arrives at the lagoon as Queen Coralie's guest.\n\nMama Hook reveals that Queen Coralie is one of her dearest old friends. Ever since their days at the Never Land Academy of Pirates and Mermaids, Coralie was Mama Hook's favorite pupil. Mama Hook donated the giant seashell Coralie uses for her concert.
