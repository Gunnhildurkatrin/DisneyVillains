His known talent is juggling while on a unicycle. He is shown to be quite emotional, like getting stanked after Howard sent him off the stage in \"So U Think U Can Stank\". He also gets stanked from humiliation when Julian reveals his secret of sleeping with Admiral Cuddles, his stuffed kitty, in \"Der Monster Klub\".\n\nJuggo, in general, is a nice guy, although he can get angry and desire revenge, like making fun of Randy and Howard while they had to perform in \"So U Think U Can Stank\". He seems to be a touchy-feely person, biting Julian's nails when watching Franz Nukid's fate nervously in \"Nukid on the Block\", and hugging Randy a few times throughout \"Der Monster Klub\".\n\n==Appearance==\nJuggo's outfit is clown clothes.  \n\n===Monster Form===\nWhen Juggo gets stanked by the Sorcerer, he changes into a red clown-like monster with four arms and normal human legs. With his many arms, stanked Juggo can juggle many objects and throw them at enemies. When upside down, he can still walk by using his arms. Although he has small legs and a huge body, Juggo can still ride a unicycle and stay balanced.\n\n==Role in the series==\nJuggo is a student at [[Norrisville High]], as well as one of the auditioners for the school's talent show as seen in \"[[So U Think U Can Stank]]\". He is dressed like a clown, and presumably does this every day. His known talent is juggling while on a unicycle. After [[Howard Weinerman|Howard]] rejected him, he got [[Stank|turned]] into a giant clown like monster by [[The Sorcerer (Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja)|the Sorcerer]]. He returned to normal when [[Randy Cunningham|Randy]] deflated the unicycle wheel.\n\nHe was also shown briefly in \"[[Night of the Living McFizzles]]\". He also appeared in \"[[Der Monster Klub]]\", wanting revenge on [[Stevens]] for constantly sad tromboning him when he dropped a juggling pin. It's also made known, courtesy of [[Julian (Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja)|Julian]], that Juggo sleeps with a stuffed kitty named Admiral Cuddles.\n\nIn \"Der Monster Klub\" following Randy accidentally revealing the secret of how to become a monster, to the Der Monster Klub, [[Julian (Randy Cunningham)|Julian]] quickly took advantage of this, and revealed a highly embarrassing secret about him, overcome with humiliation, he transformed into a monster. He thus went on a rampage, with the other members, and took revenge on his local bully. Randy fought him along with the other members of the Klub. He managed to defeat him along with the rest of the club, and fortunately due to the change he forgot the secret.\n\nIn \"Stanks Like Team Spirit\" following the chess team, losing there annual tournament, against [[Hannibal McFist|McFists]] chess playing [[Chessbot 5000|Robot]], overcome with grief he was transformed into a monster and went on a rampage. Randy managed to keep him at bay, and he was returned to normal when Howard beat the robot.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Juggo's helmet has never been taken off.\n*Thanks to Julian's big mouth, we know that Juggo sleeps with a stuffed kitty named Admiral Cuddles.\n*He is part of the school's Chess team and is stanked in \"[[Stanks Like Teen Spirit]]\" from the pain of losing to Flackville.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\">\nSo U Think U Can Stank - Students 02.jpg\nSo U Think U Can Stank - Juggo 00.jpg\nSo U Think U Can Stank - Juggo 01.jpg\nSo U Think U Can Stank - Juggo 02.jpg\nSo U Think U Can Stank - Juggo 03.jpg\nJuggo.png\nSo U Think U Can Stank - Juggo 04.jpg\nSo U Think U Can Stank - Juggo 05.jpg\nSo U Think U Can Stank - Juggo 06.jpg\nSo U Think U Can Stank - Howard 18.jpg\nSo U Think U Can Stank - Juggo 07.jpg\nSo U Think U Can Stank - Crying Juggo.png\nSo U Think U Can Stank - Juggo 08.jpg\nSo U Think U Can Stank - Juggo 09.jpg\nSo U Think U Can Stank - Stanked Juggo 03.jpg\nSo U Think U Can Stank - Stanked Juggo 04.jpg\nSo U Think U Can Stank - Stanked Juggo.png\nSo U Think U Can Stank - Stanked Juggo 00.png\nJuggomonsterclown.jpg|Stanked form\nSo U Think U Can Stank - Stanked Juggo 05.jpg\nSo U Think U Can Stank - Stanked Juggo 06.jpg\nSo U Think U Can Stank - Stanked Juggo and Ninja.png\nSo U Think U Can Stank - Stanked Juggo and Ninja 00.png\nSo U Think U Can Stank - Stanked Juggo 07.jpg\nSo U Think U Can Stank - Stanked Juggo 01.png\nSo U Think U Can Stank - Stanked Juggo 08.jpg\nSo U Think U Can Stank - Juggo 10.jpg\nSo U Think U Can Stank - Juggo.png\nSo U Think U Can Stank - Ninja 17.jpg\nSo U Think U Can Stank - Juggo 11.jpg\nSo U Think U Can Stank - Juggo 12.jpg\nNight of the Living McFizzles - Halloween.png\nNukidontheBlock - 106.jpg\nNukid on the Block - Students.png\nNukidontheBlock - 792.jpg\nDer Monster Klub - Juggo.png\nDerMonsterKlub - 278.jpg\nDerMonsterKlub - 473.jpg\nJuggo slam dunk.jpg\nSLTS - 533.jpg\n2SmellandBack - 652.jpg\nJuggo Full Body.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{RC Wiki}}\n\n{{Randy Cunningham}}\n[[Category:Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Clowns]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
