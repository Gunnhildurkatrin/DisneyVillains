She is a lovely and sweet young lady, but as she is not quite so skilled a skater as Joe, becomes swiftly annoyed at his playful pranks.\n\n==Background==\n===Physical Appearance===\nShe is a beautiful and slender woman with fair skin, dark lavender eyelids, thin black eyebrows, red-orange hair with curls and rose-red lips. She wears a yellow long-sleeved jacket with a long lime-green skirt with pink inside and multiple petticoats, magenta gloves, a yellow bonnet with a white bow and a stripe, white bloomers and white boot-like skaters.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Melody Time]]''===\nJenny and Joe spend time with each other during wintertime riding on a sleigh (along with animal couples following them). They later spend time ice-skating together ice skate but when a near-tragedy ensues on thin ice after Joe smirks at her falling as she separates from him, Joe was able to rescue her on thin ice. After rescuing, she and Joe reunite with each other riding on their sleigh again as the woodland animals bid a farewell to them.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nLove-skate.png|Jenny and Joe ice-skating\nMush.png|Jenny and Joe kissing\nBloomers.png|Jenny's bloomers showing\nBack-turn.jpg|Jenny having her back turned on Joe\nIce Crack.jpg|Jenny seeing a crack in an icehole\nFaint.jpg|Jenny fainted on an ice floe\nJennymelodytime.jpg|Jenny smiling\n1948 MELODY TIME.png\nAvatar cfe29c31209d 128.png\nTumblr meu2iyABdI1r3jmn6o1 1280.png\nTumblr ngp1rrn8QK1r3jmn6o1 1280.png\nTumblr ngp1tc8lm31r3jmn6o1 1280.png\nTumblr_nh7l05mIQ41r3jmn6o1_1280.png\nJoe and Jenny.jpeg\nDiamond2.png\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Jenny is one of the notable characters that has an invisible nose as showing her frontside (drawing concept similar to the much later drawings of the ''Bratz'' dolls).\n\n{{Melody Time}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Melody Time characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Wonderful World of Color]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Dreams! characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]"
