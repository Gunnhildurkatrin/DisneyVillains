She is very feisty but brave, and she also serves as the leader of the group. She wears a pink bow on her head to distinguish herself from her older siblings. She clearly hates being annoyed by her brothers' antics, particularly [[Budderball]]'s gluttonous appetite and flatulence issues. However, she cares deeply for them and is very protective of them, as seen in [[Air Buddies|the first film]], where she defended them from a [[Wolf (Air Buddies)|wolf]] (who turned out to be harmless). She likes wearing all sorts of outfits and is into fashion. She lives in Fernfield, [[Washington]], with her famous all-star father, [[Air Bud (dog)|Buddy]], and mother, [[Molly (Air Bud)|Molly]]. Her owner is Alice, a young girl who is also into fashion.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nRoseBud-Air-Buddies-Promote.JPG\nRosebud 1600x1200.jpg\nSnow buddies rosebud.jpg\nNormal Rosebud s.jpg\nRosebud Card.jpg\nRosebud.png|RoseBud with a soccer ball\nAir-buddies-disneyscreencaps.com-382.jpg\nSuper Buddies RoseBud.jpg\nRoseBud eating out of bowl.jpg\nRoseBud.png\nRoseBud2.jpg\nRoseBud3.jpg\nSuper Buddies RoseBud2.jpg\nSpace Buddies RoseBud.jpg\nRoseBud4.jpg\nSuper Buddies RoseBud3.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Air Bud}}\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Air Bud characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Superheroes]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]"
