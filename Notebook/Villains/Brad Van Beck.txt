He is an actor in the Channel 00 soap opera 'Anxieties', playing the main character, Perceval.\n\n==Comic History==\nHe is first mentioned in \"[[PKNA 0: Evronians]]\", when [[Donald]] is watching 'Anxieties' and finds Van Beck has been replaced by [[Sean LeDuck]], as it turns that Van Beck has disappeared. When LeDuck goes to writer Sam Plot's house, he finds [[Evronians]] who explain that they abducted Brad Van Beck as an experiment to see if the actors of 'Anxieties' can work as a catalyzer of the viewers' emotions.\n\nBrad Van Beck physically appears in [[PKNA 15: Set, Action|Issue 15]], which is mostly about the 'Anxieties' cast. Brad is shown to still be a prisoner of the Evronians, albeit having TV and good food. When [[Zoster]] brings the rest of the cast as prisoners, he gets into an unending argument with Sean LeDuck about who deserves to be Perceval. After the Evronians are defeated by [[The Duck Avenger]], filming of 'Anxieties' resumes with both actors playing long-lost twins, both named Perceval.\n\n==External links==\n* [https://coa.inducks.org/character.php?c=Brad%20Van%20Beck&view=1 Brad Van Beck] at the [[INDUCKS]]\n{{PKNA}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Van Beck, Brad}}\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Actors]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Ducks]]"
