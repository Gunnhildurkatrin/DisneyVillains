He carries his wardrobe with him wherever he goes, which is difficult (not many motorists will pick up a bear hitchhiker with 17 trunks of clothes). He has 30 coats and 40 slacks (some of which fit), 60 shirts, 47 shoes, 20 hats and a pair and a half of underwear. Each year, when the Ten Best Dressed are announced, Ernest the Dude is there (wondering why he isn\u2019t on the list).''\n\n<gallery>\nSTK683483.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Bears]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Country Bear characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
