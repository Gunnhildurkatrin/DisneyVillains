'''Experiment 521''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]]. He\u00a0is designed to mummify people in tape. His one true place is with [[Mrs. Hasagawa]] as one of her \"cats\".\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment 521 was the 521st genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to mummify people alive in tape.\n\n521 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai. Against statistically unlikely (but not impossible) odds, several experiment pods landed in one location: [[Mrs. Hasagawa]]'s yard, 521's pod being one of them.\n\nAt an unknown point, [[Mrs. Hasagawa]] mistook 521's pod for an apricot and washed it, activating the experiment. However, as 521 was not a very evil or destructive experiment, he was able to live a peaceful life with her, due to the latter seeing the former as a mere stray cat who needed a home, though he instinctively wrapped the end of her table.\n\nWhen [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Stitch]] discovered that Mrs. Hasagawa, kept several experiments as pets, they\u00a0thought they were a danger to her and, along with [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] and [[Pleakley]], decided to capture them all. Eventually, 521 completely mummified both Jumba and Pleakley in his wrapping, though due to having been previously affected by [[Manners|Experiment 358]], they were too polite to protest against it. Lilo took 521 off of Pleakley and put him in a container. After freeing the one-eyed alien, she used the wrapping as a makeshift lasso to save Mrs. Hasagawa when she was blown into the air by [[Blowhard|Experiment 533]].\n\n521 and the other experiments were about to be taken away, but were returned to Mrs. Hasagawa when Lilo and Stitch saw how much she cared for them. 521 was then named Wrapper.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nThe first 624 experiments, including Wrapper, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium\u00a0to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]] and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nWrapper participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]].\n\nThe Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.\n\n===''[[Stitch!]]''===\nWrapper made an appearance in the ''Stitch!'' anime where [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]] modified him to trap people by wrapping them up in boxes like presents. He does so by spitting a box out of his mouth that traps his victim, then uses the red tape on his tail to tie a bow around the box. He later appeared in the special ''Stitch and the Planet of Sand'', where\u00a0his roll of tape appears to be\u00a0back to its usual color.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In ''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]'', the color of Wrapper's tape is white. However, in the ''[[Stitch!]]'' anime, the color of his tape becomes red, most likely due to being modified.\n*Wrapper was activated off-screen.\n*Wrapper is one of the few experiments to not appear in the group photo at the end of ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nvlcsnap-2013-09-01-09h17m53s216.png\nWrapper_and_Gotchu.jpg\nVlcsnap-2013-03-22-20h44m34s29.png\nWrapper wrapping Pleakley.png\nvlcsnap-2013-09-01-09h12m14s114.png\nWrapper still wrapping Pleakley.png\nLilo grabs Wrapper.png\nvlcsnap-2013-09-01-09h14m07s212.png\nWrapper contained.png\nVlcsnap-2012-07-03-21h18m36s224.png\nvlcsnap-2013-04-15-07h27m59s93.png\nVlcsnap-2012-08-02-20h56m43s41.png\nVlcsnap-2013-02-08-11h59m38s131.png\nVlcsnap-2012-08-02-18h57m33s14.png\nVlcsnap-2013-03-14-09h37m36s97.png\nThe Origin Of Stitch Wrapper.jpg|Misidentified as Experiment 147 (Newton)\nscreenCapture 28.01.13 15-20-03.jpg|Wrapper in ''[[Stitch!]]'' anime\nscreenCapture 29.03.13 21-05-20.jpg\nscreenCapture 29.03.13 21-06-05.jpg\nscreenCapture 29.03.13 21-06-38.jpg\nscreenCapture 29.03.13 21-08-28.jpg\nscreenCapture 29.03.13 21-38-05.jpg\nscreenCapture 30.03.13 0-45-00.jpg\nscreenCapture 30.03.13 0-45-20.jpg\nscreenCapture 30.03.13 0-47-52.jpg\nscreenCapture 30.03.13 0-48-09.jpg\nscreenCapture 30.03.13 0-49-15.jpg\nscreenCapture 28.01.13 15-23-03.jpg\nscreenCapture 30.03.13 0-51-13.jpg\nscreenCapture 28.01.13 15-23-48.jpg\nscreenCapture 30.03.13 0-53-59.jpg\nExperiments (Planet of the Sand) 02.jpg\nExperiments (Planet of the Sand) 03.jpg\nExperiments (Planet of the Sand) 06.jpg\npanes77.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
