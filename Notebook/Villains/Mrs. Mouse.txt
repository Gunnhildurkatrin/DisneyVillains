In her third appearance in the [[1931]] Mickey Mouse newspaper comic ''Boxing Champion'', she can be seen using a hearing accessory, similar to the one [[Daisy's parents|Daisy's mother]] has.\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://paperpedia.fandom.com/it/wiki/Madre_di_Minni http://it.paperpedia.wikia.com/wiki/Madre_di_Minni]\n* [http://coa.inducks.org/character.php?c=Mrs.%20Mouse&view=1 Minnie's mother at the INDUCKS]\n* [https://picsou.fandom.com/fr/wiki/Margie_Mouse http://fr.picsou.wikia.com/wiki/Margie_Mouse]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mouse, Mrs.}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Grandparents]]\n[[Category:Mice]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Farmers]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
