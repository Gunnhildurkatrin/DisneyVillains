He is fairly dim-witted but enthusiastic.\n\n===Personality===\nMooch has a good heart, but [[Buster (Lady and the Tramp)|Buster]] doesn't see much use for him other than to crash through fences so he can get through (as Buster was incapable of unlocking gates by himself). Mooch has only but heard tales of [[Tramp]], and they're pretty exaggerated. He eventually leaves the junkyard with the other Junkyard Dogs\u00a0minus Buster, and gets adopted by a family.\n\n== Trivia==\n\n*He bears a similarity to [[Prince Eric]]'s dog, [[Max (The Little Mermaid)|Max]], as they are both the same breed.\n*His personality is very similar to [[w:c:spongebob:Patrick Star|Patrick Star]] from ''{{WikipediaLink|SpongeBob SquarePants}}'', another character voiced by [[Bill Fagerbakke]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\n19802-29391.jpg\nMooch_Full.jpg|Mooch happy\nMooch3.jpg\nMooch_Full_2.jpg\nPic_detail4c64382a7515b.png|Mooch with [[Scamp]]\n346036 1261575615523 full.jpg|Mooch howling with the other Junkyard Dogs\nLady-tramp-2-disneyscreencaps.com-3217.jpg|\"It's a spook!
