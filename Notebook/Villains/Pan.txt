He appeared in two Disney animated shorts, [[1930]]'s ''[[Playful Pan]]'' and [[1944]]'s ''[[Springtime for Pluto]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Playful Pan]]''===\nPan comes to Earth, coaxing music and dance out of the flora and fauna. Lightning strikes start a fire that nearly burn everything. Pan uses his music to lure the flames into a nearby pond where they are safely extinguished.\n\n===''[[Springtime for Pluto]]''===\nPan's brief appearance was at the beginning, appearing as a spirit. The God plays his pan-pipes to wake up [[Pluto]] and the spring. Thus reprising his role as the God of nature and the spring.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In ''[[Springtime for Pluto]]'', Pan looks similar to The Satyrs from \"[[The Pastoral Symphony]]\" segment of ''[[Fantasia]]'', only this time he wears blue overalls and a green bowler hat.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\n13205.jpg|Pan in the ''[[Playful Pan]]'' short\n13206.jpg\n13212.jpg|Pan leading the fire into the river\nSPRINGTIME FOR PLUTO.png|Pan in the ''[[Springtime for Pluto]]'' short\n38405.jpg\nTumblr m2lubvOOZe1r3jmn6o1 1280.png\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Silly Symphonies characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Gods]]\n[[Category:Hybrids]]\n[[Category:Greek Mythology]]\n[[Category:Greek characters]]\n[[Category:Fauns and Satyrs]]"
