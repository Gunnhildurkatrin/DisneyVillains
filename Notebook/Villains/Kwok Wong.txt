Despite being engaged to another woman, Kwok still has feelings for Penny, and even tries to make things right between them when she confronts him while he is at work. Later that night, he meets his fianc\u00e9 who is visiting from China, only to catch Penny and [[Dijonay Jones]] sneaking around their house at night (albeit causing both he and Penny to fall off of a ledge). Kwok later reveals to Penny (during opening night of the play) that he and his fianc\u00e9 couldn't stand each other and the wedding was off. They later reconciled and were seen performing their own version of Romeo and Juliet for Mr. Vericola.\n\nKwok is\u00a0again seen (with a speaking role) reading poetry in a popular hangout of Penny and her friends.\n\n==Physical Appearance==\nHe is Asian in appearance with spiky black hair and a gap between his front teeth.
