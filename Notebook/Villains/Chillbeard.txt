Chillbeard also apologizes to [[Sunni Gummi|Sunni]], [[Tummi Gummi|Tummi]] and [[Cubbi Gummi|Cubbi]] for all the trouble, telling them that Spring will quickly melt all the snow and have everything back on track.\n\nChillbeard is last seen flying back home with his son, in a sleigh pulled by two giant polar bears. He uses his wind horn to make an ice slide, so the young Gummi Bears are able to disembark the sleigh and return home.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n{{Adventures of the Gummi Bears}}\n[[Category:Adventures of the Gummi Bears characters]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]"
