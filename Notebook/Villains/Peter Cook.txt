He currently attends a college and lives away from home with three of his friends in a small apartment. He was voiced by [[Ogie Banks]].\n==Personality==\n\n\nPeter is a very easygoing guy that doesn't let much upset him and always tries to see the brighter side of things. He is very perceptive of others' feelings and tries to cheer them up if he senses that their down.\n\nHe is fiercely protective of his loved ones and would do anything for them. If they needed a shoulder to cry on, an ear to listen or whatever else, he is always there. He is very dependable and would drop everything and come to a loved one's side if they needed him, something he would do even if they hadn't asked. Something which he did for Taranee.\n\n==Chronology: Comic Book Issues==\n\n===Early life===\n\nPeter was born to Theresa and Lionel Cook. A few years later, his parents adopted his younger sister, Taranee. He was not aware of this fact until years later.<ref>[[Issue 078: Fire]]</ref> Before moving to Heatherfield, they lived in a town called Sesamo (called Sesame in the English translation) filled with mountains.During the summers in Sesamo, Peter would teach Taranee how to ski.<ref>[[Issue 109: Green Truth]]</ref>\n\n===Move to Heatherfield===\nPeter was very excited to move to Heatherfield as he would get to experience the town's surf, something he could never try in his hometown of Sesamo.<ref>[[The Year Before (W.I.T.C.H.)]]</ref> When he arrived, he met a girl named Irene. Peter enjoyed hanging out with her and they dated for a while. The pair broke up, however, and they eventually lost contact with each other.<ref>[[Issue 077: Of All the Stars]]</ref>\n\n===Cornelia===\nAt the inauguration for the School Olympics, Peter and Cornelia walked through the festival, hand in hand, and discussed Taranee\u2019s participation in the festival.\n\nHeatherfield citizens gathered at the beach to watch a solar eclipse. During the solar eclipse, Heatherfield was exposed to some of Kandrakar\u2019s power, allowing the wishes of everyone to be granted. Peter\u2019s (and Cornelia\u2019s) wish came true when Cornelia enthusiastically asked him out, which he agreed to. Unfortunately, he forgot all about it when Heatherfield was returned to normal.\n\nThe next day, during school, Peter approached Cornelia while she was making photocopies. He then used the photocopier to print a note. When Cornelia went to pick it up, she noticed it was actually an invitation to go on a pizza date with him and she happily agreed.<ref>[[Issue 072: The Green Ray]]</ref>\n\nPeter took Cornelia to Karmilla\u2019s one-night-only concert, but the date was nothing but awkward and silent. As Peter was about to confess his feelings to Cornelia, he, along with everyone else attending the concert, was unwittingly attacked by Folkner and his Ragorlangs. Unbeknownst to everyone though, the girls were able stop Folkner.\n\nAfter being freed from the Ragorlang\u2019s grasp, he tried to talk to Cornelia, but she had other thoughts. Cornelia grabbed his shirt and pulled him into a kiss, which he happily reciprocated. The pair then began to date each other.<ref>[[Issue 075: As You Were, You Are Now]]</ref>\n\n===Moving Out===\nPeter started looking for and found a small two bedroom apartment with three of his friends; Stan, Roger and Richard. Peter withheld the information for several months, waiting for the right time to announce it, but wasn't ready to break the news to his mom yet, so he confided in his little sister instead. Unbeknownst to him though, his mother was listening to everything outside his door. She entered his room and they talked about him moving out.\n\nOver the following days, Peter packed his stuff in boxes and received help from several people, including Taranee and Cornelia. Taranee made it known to him that she would miss him, and he jessed that he wasn't going to move out so quickly.\n\n===Last Days at Home===\nPeter spent his last days at home packing, cleaning his room and hanging out with his girlfriend. Since Taranee had gone away to camp, he had Cornelia come over to help. As Peter did work, Cornelia looked through his old photos and found one of his past girlfriends, Irene, but he assured her that that relationship ended a long time ago.\n\nLater on, Peter met Cornelia at the movie theater for a date. He quickly noticed that Cornelia was feeling down, and he reassured her that things with Irene were long over. Cornelia then mentioned that she was reminded of her first love, [[Caleb]], but reassured Peter that she loved him. Hearing her words, Peter dragged her to the photobooth for them to take pictures and remember that moment.\n\nOn the last day of vacation, Peter and Cornelia had a date on a rooftop, stargazing. They laid out blankets to sit on and watched the stars go by, with soda drinks on the side.<span style=\"font-size:11px;line-height:0px;\"> </span>Peter then moved out over the following days.\n\n===Living with Friends===\nAs soon as the four boys moved in, they created a pigsty in their home. Clothes, dirty laundry, and food was strewn about their floors and walls. The boys, however, didn't seem to care much.\n\nPeter kept in touch with Cornelia with hand-written letters, even though both of them had computers and cellphones, as they deemed it romantic. He would constantly brag about his girlfriend to his roommates.\n\n===News about Taranee===\nShortly after settling in, he received a call from his father about Taranee and her discovery of the fact that she was adopted. The news came as a surprise to Peter and he rushed back home to be by Taranee's side. He confirmed to her that, blood or no blood, they would always be siblings. As soon as the dust settled, Peter went back to his apartment.\n\n===College Life===\nPeter went on a vacation with his family, friends, and girlfriend. While teaching Cornelia how to surf, a gust of wind blew them off their board. Peter saved Cornelia from being pulled under. Later, Peter performed a set on stage with Cobalt Blue. After the holiday was over, he went back to his apartment.\n\nPeter spent the summer with his friends and family. At the end of summer, Peter, Matt, and Stephen planned a night to watch the stars, on the beach, with the girls. Peter picked up supplies alongside his sister and Hay Lin, but he got carried away with the decorations and furniture, resulting in him being chastised by Taranee. Later, as he was preparing to leave for the beach, he found that his tires had melted into the road (thanks to Taranee). Despite having to throw his original plans out the window, he still enjoyed the stars with his friends while cuddling with his girlfriend.\n\n==Chronology: TV Series==\nIn the TV show Peter meets Cornelia in the episode \"B is for Betrayal.\" He doesn't really notice her until Cornelia comes back from Meridian still with her Guardian body (but without wings and the outfit). Taranee tells Peter that this was Cornelia's older sister (Lillian). In \"F is for Facades\" the rest of w.i.t.c.h. find out that the've been dating. Taranee is not very excited about their relationship. near the end of the episode Cornelia dumps Peter and returns to Caleb.\n\n==Relationships==\n\n===Taranee===\nPeter loves his little sister, Taranee, and would do anything for her.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===Comics===\n{| style=\"width:670px;\"\n| style=\"width:129px;\"|\n*Issue 50: Forever Magic (voice only)\n*Issue 59: The Fire Within\n*Issue 62: Between the Pages\n*Issue 63: Arrival and Departure\n*Issue 65: Only a Flower\n|\n*Issue 69: New Frontiers\n*Issue 71: Glimmers of Fear\n*Issue 72: The Green Ray\n*Issue 73: The Dark Summons (mentioned only)\n*Issue 74: Whisked Away\n|\n*Issue 75: As You Were, You Are Now\n*Issue 76: Earth\n*Issue 77: Of All the Stars\n*Issue 78: Fire\n*Issue 80: Emotions\n*Issue 84: Unique Movements\n|\n*Issue 86: In the Heart\n*Issue 89: The Key to Summer\n*Issue 92: No Longer Alone\n*Issue 93: From a Place Far Away (flashback)\n*Issue 100: 100% WITCH (imagined)\n|\n*Issue 101: A Rising Star\n*Issue 105: A Dream Letter (mentioned only)\n*Issue 109: Green Truth (flashback)\n|}\n===Animated Series===\n====Season Two====\n*Episode 2: [[B is for Betrayal]]\n*Episode 6: [[F is for Facades]]\n*Episode 10: [[J is for Jewel]]\n==Trivia==\n*Peter is the only person who is an ''older'' sibling of a member of the current group of Guardians.\n*Peter is one of the very few characters in the series to have a middle name, even if rarely mentioned.\n*Despite being several years older than Taranee, he didn't realize that she was adopted until she found out years later.
