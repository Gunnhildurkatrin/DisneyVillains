The rabbit in the early Buettner LW stories is not [[Thumper]], whom Buettner drew very differently. Instead he's this character \"Li'l Bunny,\" who Buettner seems to have intended as LW's confidante before TLP were used regularly. Li'l Bunny has been translated as Thumper sometimes, but he's actually a different character.\n[[Category:Rabbits]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Articles needing improvement]]"
