She is kind, helpful, has great faith in others and selfless.\n\n==Role in the Series==\nAzurine and Prisma were born and raised on the Isle of Crystals, one of the Isles in the [[Mystic Isles]]. From an early age, Azurine's talents as a Crystalmaster was regarded as the greatest ever seen, which caused Prisma to grow insanely jealous of her. Eventually, Prisma decided to cover the Mystic Isles in crystals so she could make the most powerful magical jewels ever and become the greatest Crystalmaster. Knowing the harm this would cause to the other inhabitants, Azurine attempted to get Prisma to reconsider. When Prisma would not listen to reason, Azurine stripped her sister of her Terra Crystal and her powers.\n\nAzurine first appears when [[Sofia the First (character)|Sofia]], [[Princess Amber|Amber]], [[Skye]], and Prisma arrive at her farm. Prisma tricked Amber and Sofia into thinking Azurine was the evil Crystalmaster and she needed to reclaim her Terra crystal and her powers to stop her. After turning herself into a Crystal bird, Sofia obtains the Terra Crystal but gets caught in a net. Azurine sees this and kindly lets her out. Azurine's display of kindness helped Sofia realize Prisma's deception, but too late to stop Amber from giving her the Terra Crystal. Prisma traps Azurine in a crystal cage and sends the girls and Skye down a Crystal Vortex. Azurine could only watch in horror as Prisma used her powers to execute her plan. When Prisma dismissed Sofia's resolve to stop her, Azurine told her Sofia can stop her. Sofia quickly proved herself worthy of her faith when they obtain a Shattering Stone and used it to destroy Prisma's Terra Crystal. With a heavy heart, Azurine summons the Protectors to arrest Prisma, who attempts to escape only to be apprehended by the Protectors, Sofia, and Skye.\n\n==Gallery==\n=== ''The Mystic Isles'' ===\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nThe Mystic Isles 23.png\nThe Mystic Isles 12.png\nSofia freeing Azurine.png|Sofia busts Azurine's prison with her shatter stone.\n\n</gallery>\n\n{{Sofia the First}}\n[[Category:Sofia the First characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
