Spike also has a soft spot for Dolly, who develops a crush on him. When the holiday goes wrong, Spike helps save the day.\n\nSpike is described as being fun and cool with a sensitive side.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nSpike is a Doberman with\u00a0black-and-tan fur. He has one drooped ear and one pointing upwards with a cut on it. He also wears a shark tooth necklace.\n\n==Role in the series==\n===\"[[A Summer to Remember]]\"===\nSpike is first seen emerging from the sea before introducing himself to Dolly (who falls in love with Spike), Dylan and Summer.\n\nHe is later seen stargazing with Dolly, Dylan and Summer. He then watches on in horror as the bus carrying the rest of Dolly and Dylan's family starts to roll towards the edge of a cliff (unaware that a cow named Bessie had pushed the bus). Spike attempts to help stop the bus from falling off the cliff into the sea, but the Dalmatians' parents [[Doug (101 Dalmatian Street)|Doug]] and [[Delilah (101 Dalmatian Street)|Delilah]] manage to lighten the weight by jumping out of the bus and using a dinghy to float to a nearby island. However, the couple end up trapped on the island after a crab pops the dinghy.\n\nSpike declares that he knows where they can get a boat. He and Dolly go to the boat and go towards the island. However, a hole suddenly appears in the middle of the boat, causing it to sink. Fortunately, Spike and Dolly are able to swim to the island. Doug assumes that Spike is Dolly's boyfriend and begins to tell him about Dolly when she was younger, much to Dolly's embarrassment.\n\nA seagull named Chips, on the orders of Dylan, brings one end of a rope to the island, where Spike ties it to a tree. Dylan then travels down the rope to the island where he opens up a glider to take Spike, Dolly, Doug and Delilah back to land. However, the rope snaps, causing the group to fly high among the clouds during a storm. Dylan is able to get control of the glider and land himself and the others on a lighthouse. Spike and Dolly then share another romantic moment on the beach.\n\nThe next day, as the Dalmatians get back on the bus to return to London, Spike bids farewell to Dolly and gives her an affectionate lick. Spike and Summer then watch the bus drive off.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nSpikeDalmatianStreetModelSheetDL.png|Spike's Character Reference.\nSpikeDalmatianStreetStoryboardDL.png|Spike as he appears in a storyboard.\n20190908 131526.png|Spike with [[Doug (101 Dalmatian Street)|Doug]]\nSpikeCornishDobermanDL.png\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Spike is [[Olly Murs]]' first Disney role and his first acting role overall.\n\n{{101 Dalmatians}}\n[[Category:101 Dalmatians characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:English characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
