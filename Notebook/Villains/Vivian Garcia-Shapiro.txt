She is [[Isabella Garcia-Shapiro|Isabella]]'s mom. She enjoys playing in a jazz band with [[Linda Flynn-Fletcher|Linda]] and [[Jeremy Johnson|Jeremy]]'s moms. She lives across the street with Isabella as well as [[Pinky the Chihuahua|Pinky]], and has a rapid way of speaking.\n\n==Background Information==\n*Vivian has only spoken in 12 episodes in the entire show. She has made cameo appearances in a few more episodes.\n*Oddly, Vivian seems to embody both of her last names: She appears to be Hispanic, yet speaks with a Yiddish accent.\n*She revealed that she is a descendant from Mexican-Jewish roots (\"[[Picture This]]\").\n*Based on the mixture of her appearance and speech patterns, she may have been raised in a Mexican-Jewish household. It is also possible that she adopted some mannerisms from Isabella's yet-unnamed father, whom many speculate to be of Jewish descent.\n*In \"[[The Fast and the Phineas]]\", Vivian reveals that Candace, at some point in her life, was wearing braces. She also thinks Candace is too thin, and encourages her to eat by offering her a matzo-burrito (\"Picture This\"). She may enjoy the burritos herself, which is a marriage of staple foods in both Mexican and Jewish cultures.\n*Vivian calls her daughter \"Isa\" (\"[[Hide and Seek]]\"), which is a common shortening of her name in Spanish-speaking countries.\n*Vivian is shown to most likely be married since she has a wedding ring (\"No More Bunny Business\") although she is never seen wearing it.\n*She has an aunt who in turn has a sister. (\"[[Agent Doof]]\")\n*She can be seen at the Love Handel reunion concert, so she is probably a fan.\n*She was seen walking with a man at the neighborhood party, presumably her husband. (\"[[Love at First Byte]]\")  She was also dancing with him in \"[[Happy New Year!]]\".\n\n==Appearances==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n*\"[[The Fast and the Phineas]]\" (First appearance)\n*\"[[Raging Bully]]\" (Cameo)\n*\"[[Dude, We're Getting the Band Back Together]]\" (Nonspeak cameo)\n*\"[[Mom's Birthday]]\" (Cameo)\n*\"[[Jerk De Soleil]]\"\n*\"[[Out to Launch]]\" (Mentioned)\n*\"[[Phineas and Ferb Get Busted!]]\" (Nonspeaking cameo)\n*\"[[Tip of the Day]]\" (Nonspeak cameo)\n*\"[[Hide and Seek]]\"\n*\"[[No More Bunny Business]]\"\n{{Col-2}}\n*\"[[Picture This]]\"\n*\"[[Just Passing Through]]\"\n*\"[[Rollercoaster: The Musical!]]\"\n*\"[[A Phineas and Ferb Family Christmas]]\"\n*\"[[Phineas and Ferb and the Temple of Juatchadoon]]\"\n*\"[[Gi-Ants]]\" (Speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Agent Doof]]\" (Mentioned)\n*\"[[Happy New Year!]]\"\n*\"[[Bully Bust]]\" (Mentioned)\n*\"[[My Sweet Ride]]\"\n*\"[[Act Your Age]]\"\n{{Col-end}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"left\">\nVivian Garcia-Shapiro 2.jpg\nVivian Garcia-Shapiro.png\nJazzTrioRehearsing.png\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n<references />\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Garcia-Shapiro, Vivian}}{{Phineas and Ferb}}{{PF-Wiki}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Phineas and Ferb characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Jewish characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
