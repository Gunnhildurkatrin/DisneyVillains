As neighbors, the two pets hardly get along, though each has discovered they have much in common. \n\nHowever, he can be seen on friendlier terms with Chainsaw at times as shown in \"[[Three Ring Bind]]\" when both he and Chainsaw agreed in disgust about the [[Ringmaster (Goof Troop)|Ringmaster]]'s plan to turn his own circus animals into puppy chow (dog food).\n \nOne story, \"Goof Troop: The Adventures of Waffles and Chainsaw\", from the November [[1995]] issue of \"Disney Adventures Magazine\" has the two find alot in common when Pistol forces them to wear doll clothes and listen to her stories.\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nChar 6416.jpg\nGoofywaffles.jpg\nMaxwafflesgoof.jpg\nMaxwafflesGoof2.jpeg\nGoofy&Waffles01.png\nGoofy&Waffles02.png\nGoofy&Waffles03.png\nGoofy&Waffles04.png\nGoofy&Waffles05.png\nGoofy&Waffles06.png\nWaffles01.png\nWaffles02.png\nWaffles03.png\nWaffles04.png\nWaffles05.png\nWaffles06.png\nWaffles08.png\nWaffles09.png\nWaffles10.png\nWaffles11.png\n1992-dingo-25.jpg\n1992-dingo-P6.jpg\nChainsaw - 3 Ring Bind (4).png\nWaffles - 3 Ring Bind.png\nwafflesclaws (1).png\nwafflesclaws (2).png\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Though Waffles is officially a boy, the ''Goof Troop'' episodes \"[[Meanwhile, Back at the Ramp]]\" and \"[[Cabana Fever]]\" instead refer to him as a female.<ref>\"[[Meanwhile, Back at the Ramp]]\": Goofy says, \"Well, I once threw Waffles in the trash, and had to rescue her from the garbage truck.\"</ref><ref>\"[[Cabana Fever]]\": Goofy sees Waffles sleeping on Pete's boat and whispers, \"Waffles! Better get down, girl. You know how Pete is about his boat.\"</ref> Meanwhile, Waffles is correctly identified as male in \"[[Where There's Smoke, There's Goof]]\",<ref>When the fire chief sees Waffles, he initially says \"Isn't he sweet.\"</ref> \"[[Goofin' Hood and his Melancholy Men]]\",<ref>Goofy says to Waffles, \"Come on, boy. Tell Daddy what's botherin' ya.\"</ref> \"[[Great Egg-Spectations]]\",<ref>When Goofy asks Max why Waffles isn't good enough as a pet for Max, Max answers, \"He's yours, Dad. I gotta have a pet of my own.\"</ref> \"[[Cat's Entertainment]]\",<ref>Male pronouns and the word \"boy\" are used consistently and repeatedly all throughout this episode to refer to Waffles.</ref> \"[[Where There's a Will, There's a Goof]]\",<ref>Goofy says to Pete, \"Well, I was teachin' Waffles to catch a Frisbee in his mouth. He wasn't too handy with a shot put, so I figured, uh...\"</ref> \"[[From Air to Eternity]]\",<ref>Of Waffles, Pistol melodramatically yells, \"Save that poor kitty, P.J.! Don't let him die all alone in that tree!\"</ref> and \"[[A Pizza the Action]]\".<ref>Pistol alludes to Waffles being male when she says to Chainsaw, \"Have you ever noticed how easy it is to lure boys into a trap?\" as she prepares a bucket of ice water to trip up P.J., Max, and Waffles, the aforementioned \"boys\".</ref>\n*Waffles is absent in both ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'' and ''[[An Extremely Goofy Movie]]''. Though it is possible that he passed away due to the movies taking place three and six years, respectively, after the events of the series, the most likely reason for his absence is that he (as well as Chainsaw) simply didn't factor into the father-son story that each movie wanted to focus on between Goofy and Max, at least not in any meaningful enough way to warrant an appearance in the movies for Waffles.\n*One possible explanation for his and Chainsaw's absence could, in theory, be found in the ''Goof Troop'' comic strip \"The Adventures of Waffles and Chainsaw\" published in the November 1995 issue of ''[[Disney Adventures]]'' magazine, as said comic seemingly ends with both Chainsaw and Waffles running away from home together. Though there would be one more comic strip, \"Good Dog Card\", featuring the two at home published later in July 1996, the ending of this one has a sense of closure and finality to it for Waffles and Chainsaw that feels like it could serve as the pets' final and latest chronological appearance in ''Goof Troop'' continuity, providing them an exit from the series before the events of ''A Goofy Movie''.\n*Waffles\u2019 original design was an elderly cat (possibly Siamese-breed) and was originally called Velcrow.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Inducks character|Waffles}}\n\n{{Goof Troop}}\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Goof Troop characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]"
