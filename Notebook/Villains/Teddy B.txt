"{{Stub}}\n[[File:Teddy B.png|thumb|250px]]\n'''Teddy B''' is Donny's teddy bear from the Disney Junior show ''[[Doc McStuffins]]''. He is voiced by [[Jason Marsden]]. He and Donny love each other so much. He was in the hall closet a long time ago when Donny let him go, until Doc, Lambie and Stuffy found him. They give him a cuddle and take him to Donny to get them reunited, but the moment halts when Donny sneezes whenever Doc gave him Teddy (he is allergic to dust). They take Teddy to the clinic and Hallie and Chilly give him a hug too. Doc calls the diagnosis the 'dusty musties', and goes to ask Dr. McStuffins, her mum, to wash him in the washing machine. Teddy is afraid at first, so Lambie and Stuffy go in with him. When they are washed, Doc takes Teddy B to see Donny, and Donny and Teddy are reunited.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Teddy's voice actor, Jason Marsden, also voices characters such as [[Max Goof]] in ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'', [[Tino Tonitini]] in ''[[The Weekenders]]'', [[Kovu]] in ''[[The Lion King]]'', Richie in ''Static Shock'', Rikochet in ''Mucha Lucha'', Nermal in ''The Garfield Show'', Chester in ''The Fairly OddParents'', and [[Haku]] in ''[[Spirited Away]]''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nDoc&Teddy B.png\nTeddy-DocMcStuffins.jpg\nTeddy b and gloria dancing.jpg\nDoc and toys dancing in a line.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Doc McStuffins}}\n[[Category:Doc McStuffins characters]]\n[[Category:Bears]]\n[[Category:Toys]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
