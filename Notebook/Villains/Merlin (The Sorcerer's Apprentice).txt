Stephens}}'''Merlin''' was a great and powerful wizard, and a character from the film ''[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice (film)|The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]''.\n\n==Role in the film==\n\nMerlin was a great and powerful magician that worked as a servant in the kingdom of Camelot.\n\nDuring his service in the kingdom, Merlin took in young individuals gifted with magic with whom he formed Merlineans. Among them were [[Balthazar Blake]], [[Maxim Horvath]], and [[Veronica Gorloisen]]. At the same time, he engaged in a magical conflict against his nemesis [[Morgana le Fay]] and her own legion of sorcerers called Morganians. As with Veronica, he had an unconfirmed history with Morgana through his hesitation in their final duel; it was implied that Morgana was in fact, his former apprentice as well as Balthazar, Veronica, and Horvath's senior. Merlin looked after Morgana with love and care just as Veronica looked up to her as a role model during her (Morgana)'s time as his apprentice. Unfortunately, their relationships became sour following her betrayal and subsequent conflict which would culminated to his death at her hands, and they became archenemies since then.\n\nDuring what would be their last duel, Merlin managed to corner her and was about to reason with her for a final time. Unfortunately, Merlin was betrayed once again, this time by Horvath himself, and was later killed by Morgana le Fey. As he laid dying, Merlin gives his [[Merlin's Ring|Dragon Ring]] to Balthazar. He also charges him to find the Prime Merlinean, the only one who could destroy Morgana.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Merlin is based on the legendary [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin wizard with the same name] who existed during the time of King Arthur.\n*Merlin is only mentioned in the early script of the film as the founder of his legion of good sorcerer, referred with his full name \"'''Merlin Ambrosius'''\". Additionally, he's not Balthazar, Horvath, and Veronica's mentor as in the film as the mentor role was originally given to his modern-day successor Aurelius Flood.\n*Merlin made an appearance in flashback sequence of the prologue scene of the videogame adaptation of Disney's ''The Sorcerer's Apprentice'' on Nintendo DS where, as in the film, he was killed by Morgana who eventually sealed by Balthazar in return. The difference is that Veronica was not involved (as her character was excluded in the game's storyline).\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nMerlin and his Ring.jpg|Merlin gives Balthazar his ring before he dies\n</gallery>\n\n{{Fantasia}}\n[[Category:The Sorcerer's Apprentice characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Arthurian Legends]]\n[[Category:Mentors]]\n[[Category:English characters]]\n[[Category:Sorcerers]]"
