She looks very similar to her artist owner, having fur that is the same color as her clothes and ears that are the same length and color as her hair. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n==Role in the film==\nPrissy first appears at the beginning of the film, walking by [[Roger Radcliffe|Roger]]'s\u00a0window with her owner. [[Pongo]] spots her and concludes that she is \"a very unusual breed\" before dismissing her as not right for him. After Pongo and Roger go to the park, she is seen sitting on a stool under a bridge watching her owner paint.\u00a0Prissy makes her final appearance during the \"Twilight Bark\" scene where she is seen in an attic, watching her owner paint once again and possibly modeling for her painting. After receiving the message about Pongo's stolen [[Dalmatian Puppies|puppies]] from [[Jock]], she runs to a window and begins to bark in order to send the message to other dogs, before her owner angrily pulls her inside and closes the window. However, she quickly runs to the other side of the attic, destroying her owner\u2019s easel, sticks her head out of a ventilation shaft and resumes barking. She isn't seen or even heard of again for the rest of the film.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\">\n101-dalmatians-disneyscreencaps.com-212.jpg\n101DalmatiansPrissy (2).jpg\n101DalmatiansPrissy (4).jpg\n101-dalmatians-disneyscreencaps.com-3889.jpg.webp\n101-dalmatians-disneyscreencaps.com-3891.jpg.webp\n101DalmatiansPrissy (6).jpg\n101-dalmatians-disneyscreencaps.com-3896.jpg.webp\n101DalmatiansPrissy (7).jpg|\"Prissy, come in here!\"\n101DalmatiansPrissy (8).jpg\n101-dalmatians-disneyscreencaps.com-3915.jpg.webp\nPrissy Concept Art.jpg|Concept art of Prissy and her owner\nBachlorette Dogs Concept Art.jpg\n</gallery>\n<br />\n\n{{101 Dalmatians}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:101 Dalmatians characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
