She appeared in \"[[Witless for the Prosecution]]\" and \"[[Get Me to the Church on Time]]\" (from He's Bonkers) and briefly in \"[[The Cheap Sheep Sweep]]\" and \"[[The Toon That Ate Hollywood]]\".\n\n==Background==\nTanya Trunk played her role of Jitters' bride in \"''Get Me to the Church on Time,''\" (from He's Bonkers). Judging by a few short scenes in the episodes with Miranda, Tanya is Jitters' girlfriend, but she is not embarrassed about the fact that she is twice bigger than Jitters.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nvlcsnap-2015-09-06-19h07m24s471.png\nvlcsnap-2015-09-06-19h08m13s846.png\nvlcsnap-2015-09-06-19h08m33s956.png\nvlcsnap-2015-09-06-19h26m07s606.png\nvlcsnap-2015-09-06-19h28m04s374.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Bonkers}}\n[[Category:Raw Toonage Characters]]\n[[Category:Bonkers characters]]\n[[Category:Elephants]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]"
