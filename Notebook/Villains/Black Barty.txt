He was voiced by [[Troy Baker]].\n\nHe appears as a meet-and-greet character along the [[Rivers of America]] in [[New Orleans Square]] and also serves as the players' guide in the ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' mini-game.\n\n==Background==\nBlack Barty was a pirate and an enemy of [[Blackbeard]] during the 18th century. With the player's help, he goes about hunting treasure before Blackbeard can acquire it.\n\nBlack Barty came to [[New Orleans Square]] in 1817 where he was a compatriot of historic smuggler [[Jean Lafitte]]. He ended up cursed, in the modern times, and relied on the player character to do quests to help him find his way.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Black Barty was very likely made to serve as an analogue to [[Jack Sparrow]] from the ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean (franchise)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' film series. This is evident in his design and personality, as-well as him recreating many of Jack Sparrow's positions from the ride. It is likely that the game-developers couldn't acquire rights to use actor [[Johnny Depp]]'s likeness for the game.\n**Additionally, Blackbeard in this video-game heavily resembles Jack's nemesis [[Hector Barbossa|Barbossa]] from the films with a beard not even being included in his design.\n*Black Barty takes his name from historic pirate Bartholomew Roberts although they bare little-to-no resemblance to one another.\n**Roberts himself was once conceived for the Pirates of the Caribbean as a character who would be featured prevalently in it and connect it with [[the Haunted Mansion]] though his (fictional) ghost of [[Captain Gore]].\n**Artwork made by [[Marc Davis]] for Bartholomew Roberts would be adapted into the character of the [[Auctioneer]].\n{{Pirates of the Caribbean}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Disney Interactive Studios characters]]\n[[Category:Pirates of the Caribbean characters]]\n[[Category:Kinect Disneyland Adventures characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in video games]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]"
