He is a brown Great Dane who lives in [[London|Hampstead]] with a smaller zany terrier named [[Scottie]].\n==Appearances==\n===''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]''===\nWhen their [[Dalmatian Puppies|15 puppies]] are stolen by [[Jasper and Horace]], [[Pongo]] and [[Perdita]] decide to use the Twilight Bark to ask for help from the other dogs of [[London]]. From Pongo\u2019s bark at [[Regents Park|Primrose Hill]], Danny is one of the first dogs who heard Pongo, along with [[Scottie]]. They decided to help them and manages to spread the news all over [[England]], where the message reaches to his friend, [[Towser]], in an English countryside. When he is informed about the puppies' location from the [[Colonel]], Danny calls Pongo and Perdita to tell them the news. They meet at Primrose Hill where Danny informs Pongo and Perdita that their puppies have been located somewhere North in Suffolk. Danny leads them to Camden Road, giving them instructions to head to Rivermarsh and search for Towser,\u00a0who will lead them to the Colonel, who will take them to the [[Cruella De Vil|De Vil]] [[Hell Hall|place]]. When Perdita signals shock at the name \"De Vil,\" Danny questions if it's someone that Pongo and Perdita know, but he gets no answer as Pongo feels there's no time to explain. He wishes Pongo and Perdita good luck and reminds them that if they lose their way, they should contact the \"Barking Chain\" that it will be standing by. His help is useful to Pongo and Perdita, as they found their puppies in the end.\n\nHe is not seen or even heard of throughout the rest of the film, but it can be assumed that he found out that when the puppies returned home, he and the other dogs discovered that it was [[Cruella De Vil|Cruella]] who was behind the dognapping theft.\n\n===''[[101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure]]''===\nDanny makes a brief cameo in the sequel during the \"Twilight Bark\" sequence. Danny is seen with another Great Dane called Tiny, who both overhear a Chihauhua barking from a\u00a0phone booth and start sending the message across London\u00a0too.\n\nTheir humans appear to be two of the performers who appear in ''[[Mary Poppins]]''\u00a0during the \"[[Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious]]\"\u00a0number.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\n101-dalmatians-disneyscreencaps.com-3736.jpg|Danny seen from a far distance\nTumblr_nhmxx1zvS01qhcrb0o1_1280.jpg\n101-dalmatians-disneyscreencaps.com-3747.jpg|Danny talking to [[Pongo]]\n101-dalmatians-disneyscreencaps.com-3751.jpg|Danny listening to Pongo's barking signal\n101-dalmatians-disneyscreencaps.com-3762.jpg|Danny with [[Scottie]]\n101-dalmatians-disneyscreencaps.com-3778.jpg|\"It's Pongo!
