She is the grandmother of [[Soos Ramirez]].\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nAbuelita is a very calm old woman with fairly simple wants and needs, desiring only quiet\u00a0and cleanliness, as seen by her habit of instantly jumping to clean things the moment they're dirtied. Despite her somewhat sedentary behavior, however, she's still quite aware of her surroundings, as she was quick to point out that she couldn't support the Pines family for long with how much food she could afford. She speaks both English and Spanish.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nAbuelita is an elderly woman, with a somewhat portly frame and stout build, similar to her grandson. She has a head of tall, puffy, blue-grey hair, and wears a pair of pale emerald green earrings. She typically wears a magenta shirt, and a cooking apron with a heart on it.\n\n==Role in the series==\nAbuelita first appears in \"[[Gideon Rises]]\". After the events of the previous episode, \"[[Dreamscaperers]]\",\u00a0[[Dipper Pines|Dipper]], [[Mabel Pines|Mabel]], and [[Stan Pines|Stan]]\u00a0are forced to move in with her\u00a0due to\u00a0[[Li'l Gideon|Gideon]]'s\u00a0hostile takeover of\u00a0[[the Mystery Shack]]. She is seen to be very tolerant of their presence, only asking that they keep quiet. She cleans up any messes they happen to make with a vacuum, including Stan messing up her lipstick upon figuring out Gideon's secret and kissing her, before walking away saying she'll vacuum her face now.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Abuelita means \"grandma\" or \"granny\" in Spanish.\n*In the episode, \"[[Weirdmageddon Part 1]]\" she is turned into a chair by [[Bill Cipher]]'s magic. However, she remains unfazed despite being a chair.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nAbuelita 10 year ago.png|Abuelita with Soos at his twelfth birthday\nS1e20 Soos' grandma.PNG\n</gallery>\n\n{{GFWiki}}\n{{Gravity Falls}}\n\n[[es:Abuelita]]\n[[nl:Abuelita]]\n[[pl:Babcia Soosa]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Gravity Falls characters]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Grandparents]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Widows/Widowers]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
