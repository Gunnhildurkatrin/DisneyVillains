Though referred to as \"Uncles\", it is unknown if they're actually related to anyone within the house.\n\n==Personality==\nSpike and Dimitri are incredibly competitive over who will ring their doorbell. Though they aren't seen in full in the film, a Disney Adventures comic shows that they, in fact, are merely squatting inside the planters for reasons unknown. In the Meet the Robinsons video game, they randomly scream when passing by one of their planters, again for reasons unknown.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Meet the Robinsons]]''===\nSpike and Dimitri play a very small role in the movie, appearing only when [[Lewis Robinson|Lewis]] and [[DOR-15]] tried to enter the [[Anderson Observatory|Robinson Mansion]] by way of the front door. As stated before, they compete for doorbell rings. Dimitri wins both, though Spike insists this is only by a technicality. They also appear briefly when [[Bud Robinson|Bud]] introduces the duo to Lewis. When Wilbur asks Lewis who he has met and what he has learned about his family, Lewis describes Spike and Demitri as twins but does not know who they are related to which Wilbur admits not even he or any of the Robinson\u2018s truly know.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"medium\" captionalign=\"center\">\nmeet-the-robinsons-disneyscreencaps.com-3687.jpg\nmeet-the-robinsons-disneyscreencaps.com-3696.jpg\nmeet-the-robinsons-disneyscreencaps.com-3698.jpg\nmeet-the-robinsons-disneyscreencaps.com-4247.jpg\nmeet-the-robinsons-disneyscreencaps.com-5336.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Meet-the-Robinsons}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Meet the Robinsons characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Twins and Triplets]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
