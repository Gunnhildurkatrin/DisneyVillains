"{{Dablink|the character Phoebe from [[Guilty Party]]|other characters|[[Phoebe]]}}\n[[File:DGP_-_Phoebe_Bio_Img.jpg|thumb|250px]]\n'''Phoebe Dickens''' is a character from the video game ''[[Guilty Party]]''.\n\n==Official Biography==\nDaughter of [[Dorian Dickens|The Commodore]] and [[Olivia Dickens|Olivia]]. Unlike her big brother [[Max Dickens|Max]], she enjoys detective work so much that she's training with the FBI. This irks the Commodore because he doesn't consider the Feds on a par with the Dickens Detective Agency, and worries that Phoebe might be dulling her edge.\n\nIf she is, it's hard to tell; she is tall, athletic, and probably the most energetic of the detectives, apart from the kids. As a result of her FBI training, or perhaps her experiences as the mother of \"Kid Riddle,\" she will occasionally snap into an extremely serious during a tense investigation. Not a mom you want to mess with.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dickens, Phoebe}}\n[[Category:Characters introduced in video games]]\n[[Category:Guilty Party characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Interactive Studios characters]]\n[[Category:Detectives]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]"
