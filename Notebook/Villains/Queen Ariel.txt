As a demonstration, she turns the queen into a pig while Circe masquerades as the queen. At the end of the episode, Queen Ariel and her king were back to normal, and Circe was turned into a pig by her own magic.\n\n==Trivia==\n*She shares the same name with [[Ariel]] from ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'', though she is a princess while this Ariel is a queen.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"185\" captionalign=\"center\">\nCirce8.jpg\nHomer and Ariel as Pigs.gif|Ariel and her husband, Homer, as pigs.\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{DuckTales}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ariel}}\n[[Category:Queens]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:DuckTales characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Greek characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Pigs]]"
