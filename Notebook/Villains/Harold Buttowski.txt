He is usually cheery and easygoing but is also very overcautious and neurotic about possible sources of danger. He also has an unhealthy love for his 1979 AMC Pacer Wagon, calling it \"Monique\" and his wife does the same by calling her car \"Antonio\". He seems to enjoy opening letters and was a master at ping pong when he was growing up. Harold and his wife are in their late 30s to early 40s.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Buttowski, Harold}}\n{{Kick Buttowski: Suburban Daredevil}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Kick Buttowski characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Anti-villains]]"
