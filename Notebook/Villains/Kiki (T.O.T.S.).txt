She also wears a yellow collar with the T.O.T.S. logo around her neck and a white diaper with yellow linings and mountains prints.\n\n==Personality==\nKiki, like most kittens, is very curious and can also be easily confused about who her parents are, as she mistaken Pip and Freddy for her mother and father, until when she got tired after dancing, she was finally delivered to her real parents and saw the real thing.\n\n==Trivia==\n*She is voiced by Amari McCoy, who also voiced Precious the Panda, Penny the Pitbull Pup, Clarissa the Cow and Ellie the Elephant. \n*Kiki is the first TOTS delivery that Pip and Freddy made.\n*Her first words are \"Mama, Dada!\"\n*Even though Kiki called Pip her mama, he thought of her as his little sister than a daughter when he held onto her while she purred in his flippers.\n\n{{T.O.T.S.}}\n[[Category:T.O.T.S. characters]]\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Infants]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]"
