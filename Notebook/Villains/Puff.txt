[[BeBe & CeCe Proud]]\u00a0enjoy playing with Puff. Unfortunately, they don't realize that Puff is a living animal who has feelings and pain receptors. Suga Mama goes hysterical if he is missing. Since Suga Mama can't see very well, he is a seeing-eye dog of sorts. [[Oscar Proud|Oscar]] is shown to dislike Puff, but Oscar did help when Puff got lost.\n\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{The Proud Family}}\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:The Proud Family characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Time travelers]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Giants]]"
