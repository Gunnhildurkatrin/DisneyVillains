At first, Professor Porter assumed she was a man, but when he saw that she was a woman, he was instantly smitten by her. So much so, that he went through great lengths to find a \"fountain of youth\" in order to become younger for her. In the end, the two formed a romantic relationship any way.\n\nShe later returned to Africa to spend time with the Professor, but that time, she brought her nephew, [[Ian]] with her.\n\n{{Tarzan}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Doyle, Dr.}}\n[[Category:Irish characters]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:Aunts]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Tarzan characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]"
