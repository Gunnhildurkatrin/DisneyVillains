He is the monster husband of [[Eclipsa Butterfly]] and a misunderstood hero.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nBefore his official appearance, Globgor was said to be a sinister being who devoured Mewmans and had little to no remorse for any of his violent and unholy actions. However, this could not be anymore further from the truth. Globgor is revealed to be a sweet, sensitive and diplomatic individual who cares about those around him. While it was once true that he was a violent being, he softened over time thanks to Eclipsa to whom he is eternally devoted to. Globgor does display some dark humor that is leftover from his former ways, but is overall a nice and friendly person. He was willing to leave Mewni in order to protect Eclipsa and Meteora as he felt that his presence would put them in danger and he is also shown to be a very forgiving person. It is implied that the birth of Meteora is the source of his new view on life and how he decides to live it.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nGlobgor is a tall bulky being with purple skin and darker purple marks on his arms and legs. He has claws and a tail with a tuft of hair at the end of it. He has four yellow eyes, sharp teeth, a small piece of frizz on his chin (implied to be a goatee), small horns, pointy ears, and light pink hair that is long with a knot on top of his head. Globgor is usually seen wearing only a green speedo, though he has also been shown to wear a tailored suit consisting of black pants, a belt, a white shirt that is unbuttoned at the top and a green vest. \n\n===Powers and abilities===\n\n*'''Size alteration''': Globgor has the ability to change his size to suit his needs. This also affects his strength as well as he is effective in battle when using it. He can also change the size of individual body parts.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nConquer 11.jpg\nThe Monster and the Queen.jpg\nThe Monster and the Queen 2.png\nThe Monster and the Queen 3.png\nThe Monster and the Queen 4.png\nCornonation 1.png\nDoop-Doop 1.png\nReady, Aim, Fire 1.png\nPizza Party 9.png\nCleaved 10.jpg\nCleaved 11.png\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*As revealed in ''The Magic Book of Spells'', Globgor strongly disagreed with [[Toffee]]'s plan to commit a Mewman genocide, and he advocated for peace.\n*Globgor is a vegetarian.\n\n==External links==\n\n*{{Interwiki|https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/star-and-the-forces-of-evil/images/6/64/Favicon.ico|starvstheforcesofevil|Globgor|Star vs. the Forces of Evil Wiki}}\n\n{{Star vs. the Forces of Evil}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Star vs. the Forces of Evil characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Kings]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Giants]]"
