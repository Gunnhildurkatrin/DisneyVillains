In every episode, they recap the current events, appearing during the plot twist, the climax and the ending through song.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Though they usually wear their farming type outfits, there are some occasions where this isn't the case. For example, in the episode \"[[Here Comes the Sun (episode)|Here Comes the Sun]]\", they wore night shirts, night caps and a nightgown during the night sequences. And they wear winter clothing during the episodes where it snows.\n*Sometimes other characters on the show interact with them. In the episode \"[[Bandit Toby]]\", [[Kit Cactus]] swiped the banjo from one of them. In \"[[The Ballad of Sweet Strings]]\", [[Johnny Strum]] made off with their instruments after mesmerizing them with his voice.\n*Since they usually appear to add musical commentary to each episode, they could be considered the \"Greek chorus\" of the show. \n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nPrairie Dog on Ranch.png\nPrairie Dogs coughing.png\nPrairie Dog Carolers.png\nKit Cactus Prairie Dogs.png\nPrairie Dog Trio on the roof.png\nPrairie Dog Trio Hypnotized.png\nPrairie Dog Pajamas.png\nPrairie Dog trick or treaters.png\nYonderville Prairie Dog Trio.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Sheriff Callie's Wild West}}\n[[Category:Sheriff Callie's Wild West characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Rodents]]\n[[Category:Character trios]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]\n[[Category:Characters who narrate the story]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
