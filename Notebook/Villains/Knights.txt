They are brought to life by way of the [[Substitutiary Locomotion]] spell and face off against [[Colonel Heller]] and the [[Nazis (Bedknobs and Broomsticks)|Nazis]].\n\n==Role in the film==\nThe knights are a collection of magically-animated suits of armor, capable of walking and moving like people. They largely consist of Middle Age-era English knights, but also include Elizabethan guardsmen, Cavaliers, Redcoats, Highlanders, and even executioners.\n\nBeing completely hollow and not truly alive, the knights are impervious to most damage, including bullets- in more than one instance, the Nazis fire several machine gun rounds into the knights. Though they create several dents and holes in their armor, the knights don't even flinch, stopping only to pull off parts of their body and shake out the bullets rattling around inside them.\n\nIn hand-to-hand combat, the knights are found to be capable of detaching and moving their individual parts independently, with fists and boots swinging on their own.\n\nDespite having no mouths, the knights are also able to speak. During their march, they chant the Substitutiary Locomotion spell, as well as playing horns and bagpipes.\n\nAlthough the Nazis flee, Miss Price is thrown from her broom when her workshop is blown up by them as a small act of revenge. This breaks the spell, and the uniforms collapse as though deflated where they stand. In spite of this, it can be inferred that the magical spirits that occupied the armor can once again rest in peace knowing that they have fulfilled their duty and defended their country from the enemy.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"180\">\nMedieval Art of the Knights.jpg\nMedieval Knights 2.jpg\nMedieval Knights 3.jpg\nMedieval knight art charge.jpg\nKnights Horse.jpg\nArmy 2.jpg\nHighlanderBnB.jpg\nRedcoatBnB.jpg\nArmy.jpg\nBedknobs-broomsticks-disneyscreencaps.com-15066.jpg\nBedknobs-broomsticks-disneyscreencaps.com-15140.jpg\nBedknobs-broomsticks-disneyscreencaps.com-15147.jpg\nBedknobs-broomsticks-disneyscreencaps.com-15158.jpg\nBedknobs-broomsticks-disneyscreencaps.com-15175.jpg\nBedknobs-broomsticks-disneyscreencaps.com-15184.jpg\nBedknobs-broomsticks-disneyscreencaps.com-15189.jpg\nBedknobs-broomsticks-disneyscreencaps.com-15200.jpg\nBedknobs-broomsticks-disneyscreencaps.com-15218.jpg\nTelephonehat.jpg\nBedknobs-broomsticks-disneyscreencaps.com-15260.jpg\nBowmen-BnB.jpg\nBedknobs-broomsticks-disneyscreencaps.com-15302.jpg\nBedknobs-broomsticks-disneyscreencaps.com-15352.jpg\nBedknobs-broomsticks-disneyscreencaps.com-15387.jpg\nExecutionerBnB.jpg\nBedknobs-broomsticks-disneyscreencaps.com-15403.jpg\nBedknobs-broomsticks-disneyscreencaps.com-15421.jpg\nScreenshot_2021-01-06_115741.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Bedknobs and Broomsticks}}\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Bedknobs and Broomsticks characters]]\n[[Category:Those brought back to life]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Magical Objects]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Knights]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Created by Magic]]\n[[Category:Articles of Clothing]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]"
