She was once a young girl until an incident where she had a squirrel embedded in her forehead. Afterwards, her soul became trapped within a Mirror World. To summon Gory Agnes in a mirror, one would need to pour sunbathing oil on their head, paint an all-seeing eye over their heart, and say Gory Agnes' name three times while looking into a mirror.\n\n==Role in the Series==\nGory Agnes first appeared in [[Gory Agnes|the titular episode of the same name]]. After [[Peanut]] watched a television episode about Agnes, he dared [[Pickle]] to try and summon her in the bathroom mirror. After giving it a try, it seemed like a rip-off\u2014until the candle blew out and left the bathroom in the dark. Agnes suddenly appeared in the mirror and spewed black goo all over the duo. The next day, Peanut returned after his shift at [[Mj\u00e4rt Mart]] and found that Pickle was now taking Agnes out on dates. Of course, the only reason Agnes was around was because Pickle the first boy to ever call her back.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nGory Agnes squirrel incident.png|Agnes after the squirrel incident.\nGory Agnes apparation.png|Gory Agnes appears in the mirror.\nPickle and Peanut scared of Gory Agnes.png|Peanut and Pickle scared to death.\nGory Agnes vomit.png|Agnes spewing black goo.\nGory Agnes.jpg\nGory Agnes pizza place.png\nGory Agnes Mirror World.png|Agnes showing Pickle around the Mirror World.\nGory Agnes friends.png|Gory Agnes with her friends.\nGorgeous Agnes.png\nGory Agnes chase.png\nGory Agnes mirror shatter.png\nGory Agnes sleepover camp.jpg|Gory Agnes having a sleepover.\nGory Agnes appears in photo.png\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Pickle and Peanut}}\n[[Category:Pickle and Peanut characters]]\n[[Category:Spirits]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Zombies]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
