At first things go smoothly, but then Sofia starts dancing out of control (due to magic shoes Amber gave her), ruining the dance lesson.\n\nIn the episode \"[[Make Way for Miss Nettle]]\", we learn that he stays late after school and hates evil fairies. When he tried to stop Miss Nettle from finding the Headmistrisses' spellbook, she traps him in a bubble. After stopping Miss Nettle,\u00a0Sofia, James, and Desmond\u00a0realize that they had forgotten about Professor Popov, who is still in a bubble. Unfortunately, the bubble began floating around, forcing the children to go after the departing professor. James boasts of Popov's skill as a dance teacher to Sofia, saying that one lesson from him will teach her the ropes. Popov himself is affected by this boasting in him facing Nettle unarmed. However, Roland did not pay attention in dance class, despite Popov's entertaining and forceful personality, and so became a bad dancer, stepping on Sofia's foot at her first ball.\u00a0\n\n==Trivia==\n*\"Popov\" (\u041f\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0432) is a common Russian and Bulgarian surname, meaning \"son of the priest\".\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Sofia the First}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Popov, Professor}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Schoolteachers]]\n[[Category:Dancers]]\n[[Category:Sofia the First characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:European characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
