She is the Princess of Isleworth, who was turned into a beast by [[Zinessa]], her kingdom's greatest enchantress, as punishment because she had been rude and insensitive to her friend, Morris the Goblin. To break the curse, Charlotte had to become true friends with Morris.\u00a0\n\n\n\n==Role in the Series==\nThe [[Amulet of Avalor]] summoned [[Sofia the First (character)|Sofia]] to help her accomplish this goal because at one time Charlotte had worn the amulet. With Sofia's encouragement, Charlotte slowly becoming friends with Morris, realizing that they have a lot in common. When the royal guards came around looking for [[Morris (Sofia the First)|Morris]], believing he kidnapped her, she froze not willing to let guards see her in her beast form, allowing them to take him away.\n\nRealizing that she made a mistake, she returns home and revealed her beast form to everyone, including her worried parents. She admitted that she now understood what it was like to be treated as if she didn't have any feelings and that judging people by their appearances was wrong. The curse breaks and Charlotte returns to her normal self. She invites Morris to her ball as her guest. Thanking Sofia for her help, she spends the night dancing with Morris at the ball.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Unlike Disney's version of ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'' that inspired her debut episode, Charlotte's beast appearance appears to be based on the classical depiction of the Beast from the fairytale, as she resembles a cross between a human and a boar rather than a mixture of different animals. However, she does have a bushy tail similar to a wolf.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\">\nBeauty Is the Beast.jpg|Charlotte as a beast\nSofia the First - More to Adore.jpg\nGulity.png\nBecoming Friends.png\nDancing the waltz.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Sofia the First}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Charlotte, Princess}}\n[[pt-br:Princesa Charlotte]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Princesses]]\n[[Category:Sofia the First characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]"
