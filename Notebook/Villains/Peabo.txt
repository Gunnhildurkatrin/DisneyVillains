Despite his age, he is very smart. He is also constantly telling Oscar he doesn't think he should do something but despite his warnings, Oscar does it, anyway, and gets hurt. Usually ending with: \"I told you, Mr. Proud\". He is also the only person who likes Proud Snacks. He often gets Oscar into trouble. He got him electrocuted, caught by [[Trudy Proud|Trudy]] when he was about to have an affair with two pretty girls, and attacked by a giant bird. His catchphrase is \"Remember what happened last time\", after reminding Oscar of a last time Oscar has done something that had gotten him hurt.\n\nHe seems to hang around the Prouds a lot, and also attends church with them.\n\n==Episode Appearances==\n===Season Two===\n*Poetic Justice\n*The Camp, The Counselor, The Mole, and the Rock\n*Dirt Man Revolutionary War\n===Season Three===\n*Monkey Business\n*Peabo's Bodexilent Voyage\n==Trivia==\n* Peabo's voice actress, Cree Summer, also did the voices of Susie Carmichael from Nickelodeon's ''Rugrats'' and Numbuh 5/Abigail Lincoln from Cartoon Network's ''Codename: Kids Next Door''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\npeaboinlove.png\npeabodoor.png\npeabotv.png\npeabowatch.png\noscarfingerfire.png\noscarbird.png\npeabointro.png|Peabo during the intro\nPeabochurch.png\nPeaboscissors.png\npeabocute.png\npeabozoey.png\npeabowalkie.png\npeaboshocked.png\npeabogirlfriend.png\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n<references />\n{{The Proud Family}}\n[[Category:The Proud Family characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
