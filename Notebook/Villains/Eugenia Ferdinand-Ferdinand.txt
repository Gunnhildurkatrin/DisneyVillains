She was working for [[Baron Von Sheldgoose]] and now she is currently working for [[Donald Duck]], but has also a rivalry relantionship with him for who will become the new president of The New Quackmore Institute.\n\n==Role in the series==\n\nIn \"[[Mount Rushmore or Less]]\", Eugenia Ferdinand-Ferdinand arrives at Clinton Coot's cabana and explains that she has arrived for the annual soir\u00e9e and as the inhabitants of Clinton's cabana are residents, everyone must attend as an evening of elegance and sophistication, asking the Caballeros to set it out. [[April, May, and June]] remember what Eugenia said to the group to which the three dress Xandra properly while the Caballeros are playing cards. Later when, [[Baron Von Sheldgoose]] and his ancestor [[Lord Felldrake Sheldgoose|Felldrake]] return to their mansion, they approach Eugenia who explains to them that the annual soir\u00e9e is happening tonight, demanding Sheldgoose to explain his absences and if he doesn't explain himself about his absences, Eugenia will become the new president of the New Quackmore Institute. Felldrake then tells his ancestor to prepare for the soir\u00e9e. Then as Sheldgoose continues planning to become president as he plans to seek revenge against Eugenia, Felldrake warns that they must retrieve the Spark of Life which is more important than his evil plots. Outside, the Caballeros see Eugenia outside to upon seeing her, she leads the board members to enter the mansion, granting access to her and the guests to which the Caballeros attempt to follow them but cannot enter so the three decide to find an alternate way to enter. Eugenia is then present during a meeting with Felldrake where Sheldgoose delivers a speech of becoming the new president of the Institute to which the members are furious about Sheldgoose's lies and nonsense to which a nearby chef warns him that there is a bear in the house. Suddenly, [[Humphrey the Bear]] arrives and scares the guests away, leaving the speech incomplete as the guests led by Eugenia run away as the Caballeros notice Sheldgoose going after Humphrey in the mansion.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nLegend_of_the_Three_Caballeros_Peacock.png\nScreenshot_20191208-181409_YouTube.jpg\nScreenshot_20191208-181419_YouTube.jpg\nScreenshot_20191208-181435_YouTube.jpg\nScreenshot_20191208-181443_YouTube.jpg|\"We'll see who wins the presidency.\"\nScreenshot_20191208-181459_YouTube.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*The name \"Eugenia\" is the female version of the name \"Eugene\".\n*Her appearance is like as a male peacock (because male peacocks have blue feathers with tail feathers colored in green with circles on them); in real-life, female peacocks have brown feathers with gray tones and their tails are much shorter than males.\n** It's possible that she may, in fact, be transgender, which would explain the male peafowl plumage.\n*It is possible she likes the color pink because she wears pink clothes.\n\n{{Saludos Amigos/The Three Caballeros}}\n[[Category:Peacocks]]\n[[Category:The Three Caballeros characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]"
