'''Experiment 234''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]]. He was designed to use the built-in speaker in his tail to eavesdrop on private enemy conversations; he will cease doing so if he is petted on the head. His one true place is with [[Cobra Bubbles]] as a CIA operative.\n\n==Background==\n===Physical appearance===\nShush is a\u00a0pink weasel/mouse-like experiment with large ears\u00a0containing microphone insides, black eyes, dark brown markings, a large lavender nose, a thin mouth, and a speaker at the end of his\u00a0tail.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nShush can amplify anything he hears through the \"speaker\" in his tail. His large\u00a0ears also seem to have sensors sticking out that supposedly gives him extremely enhanced hearing, and he can direct his hearing to an exact location, drowning everything else out.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment 234 was the 234th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to eavesdrop on private enemy conversations. 234 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.\n\n234's pod was found by [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] in a playground, where [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Stitch]] were present. Gantu then attempted to escape with the pod, but Lilo and Stitch were able to get the experiment pod back from Gantu after a brief struggle.\u00a0Unfortunately, a pair of kids then soaked Lilo and 234's pod with their super-soakers, activating the experiment.\n\n234, named Shush, used the speaker in his tail to eavesdrop on the fleeing kids and Gantu. He later eavesdropped on [[Mrs. Hasagawa]] and\u00a0also [[Officer Kahiko]], which Lilo found quite fascinating.\n\nWhen Lilo brought Shush [[Lilo's House|home]], the latter eavesdropped on [[Nani Pelekai|Nani]] talking to [[David Kawena|David]] on the phone, to which Lilo mistook as her older sister trying to insult David. After Nani cleared everything up with Lilo, she reprimanded her younger sister for eavesdropping on other people's private conversations.\n\nHowever, Lilo later used Shush to eavesdrop on [[Mertle Edmonds|Mertle]] dismissing her dolls, despite Stitch telling Lilo otherwise. She mistook Mertle's statement as a dismissal of [[Elena, Teresa, and Yuki|the hula girls]]. They believed Lilo at first after she informed them and shunned Mertle before taking sides, but were more strict about being told what to do.\n\nShortly after, an escaped [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]] on a\u00a0PC screen talked Mertle into catching the remaining experiments in place of Gantu (who had been fired for his incompetence earlier), to which she accepted. H\u00e4msterviel then put a special mind-control headband device on Mertle's head, which hypnotized her into becoming his \"android\".\n\nAfter hanging out with the hula girls for a while, Lilo decided to go check on Mertle and took Stitch and Shush with her. They soon ran into [[Mrs. Edmonds]], who was carrying several boxes of Mertle's old dolls that she was giving away, thus revealing what Mertle was really talking about earlier. Lilo suddenly felt guilty about eavesdropping.\n\nLilo, Stitch, and Shush eventually went to [[Mertle's House|Mertle's house]] to apologize. However, Mertle ambushed them\u00a0and then immobilized Shush. Gantu soon intervened and attempted to recapture Shush\u00a0so as\u00a0to\u00a0redeem himself. After a long battle, Lilo and Stitch were able to defeat H\u00e4msterviel and rescue Shush.\n\nLater, [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] removed the mind-control headband from Mertle's head, which reverted her back to her normal self, and Shush was shortly thereafter found a one true place with [[Cobra Bubbles]] (whom Lilo had telephoned) as a CIA operative.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nThe first 624 experiments, including Shush, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]], and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nIt is unknown whether or not Shush participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]].\n\nThe Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink|Shush}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Shush's [[Experiment Pods|pod]]\u00a0color is green.\n*Shush is one of the few experiments to not appear in the group photo at the end of ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''.\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Spies]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
