He lives alone in the [[Village (Beauty and the Beast)|village]] working as a potter.\n\nJean is first seen in the village asking [[Belle]] about where she's headed, and responds that the book she has read sounds boring after she tells him what it's about. Before that question, it appeared that Jean is one of the few people who is friendly towards Belle and doesn't talk about her behind her back like the other villagers. Belle as well seems to enjoy him, even asking in concern if he had lost something again and laughed in amusement of his inability to remember what he had lost, though not in a malicious way.\n\nJean is then later seen in the [[Tavern (Beauty and the Beast)|tavern]] when [[LeFou]] is trying to cheer up [[Gaston]] after Belle rejected his proposal. He witnesses [[Maurice]]'s claims about the Beast, and like the rest of the town, believes him to be crazy. However, Belle returns and proves her father's sanity by revealing the Beast's existence with a magic mirror, which made all the villagers (including Jean) realize that Maurice was telling the truth.\n\nHowever, Gaston tricks Jean and the villagers into participate in the attack on Beast's castle by lying that the Beast is a threat. Jean obviously fell for it, but after the curse is lifted following Gaston's death, Jean's memory is restored and he is reunited with his wife and son, finally realizing the true events. He is last seen happily dancing with his wife during a grand ball hosted by Belle and the Beast (who has turned back into the Prince).\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*His appearance during the song \"[[Belle (song)|Belle]]\" replaces Belle's conversation with the baker in the original film, despite the baker making an appearance right before Mr. Potts is first seen.\n*Like [[Sir Francis Tremaine]], in Disney's [[Cinderella (2015 film)|live-action adaptation]] of ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'', he is revealed to be the previously unknown spouse of a main character. However, he is still alive during the events of his film while Sir Francis dies in ''Cinderella''.\n*The film novelization indicates that it is his mule that Belle uses to help with her laundry.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nBeauty-beast17-disneyscreencaps.com-578.jpg\nBeauty-beast17-disneyscreencaps.com-600.jpg|\"Sounds boring.\"\nPotts Family Reunited.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Beauty and the Beast}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]\n[[Category:Beauty and the Beast characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:French characters]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in remakes]]"
