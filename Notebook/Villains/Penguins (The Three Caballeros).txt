As their names imply, they are a group of penguins living in the South Pole in Antarctica.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===''[[The Three Caballeros]]''===\nThe penguins love to play in the snow doing their activities such as fishing, skiing, tobogganing, and swimming, with the exception of [[Pablo]], who, unlike the other penguins, wants to live in warmer regions such as the Gal\u00e1pagos. The other penguins attempted to bid Pablo farewell whenever he had an idea to leave Antarctica, but the plan would fail and they would often get hurt in the plan's undoing. By the time Pablo came up with a surefire way to leave, the goodbye party had been reduced to one penguin, who christened Pablo's \"boat\" before it drifted away.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n{{Saludos Amigos/The Three Caballeros}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Penguins}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:The Three Caballeros characters]]\n[[Category:Penguins]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]"
