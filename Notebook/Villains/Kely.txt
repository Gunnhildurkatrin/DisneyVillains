During the dispute between him and Heng Heng, the [[Lion Guard]] takes him, his troop, and Heng Heng to [[Rani (The Lion Guard)|Rani]] to alternate shifts between the two of them.\n\n==Role in the series==\nAside from his cameo appearances in \"[[The River of Patience]]\" and \"[[Little Old Ginterbong]]\", Kely plays an important role in the episode \"[[The Lake of Reflection]]\" where he and his lemurs argue with Heng Heng and his lemurs about bamboo. As the Lion Guard looks at their dispute, Kely introduces himself to the Guard, telling the group about what Heng Heng is doing with the lemurs' bamboo. The dispute between her and Kely is interrupted as the Lion Guard (this time only with Bunga, Fuli, Ono, Beshte, and Anga) takes her to [[Rani (The Lion Guard)|Queen Rani]] to solve the problem. Just as the Guard, Kely, his lemurs, and Heng Heng approach Rani, she gives the panda and the lemurs about shifting routines in the bamboo forest as a compromise to which the lemurs and pandas share the bamboo first while Heng Heng does her bamboo routine next. Heng Heng takes the lemurs to the bamboo forest with the problem solved.\n\nIn \"[[Triumph of the Roar]]\", Kely is one of the victims under attack by [[Makucha's Army]]. Fortunately, [[Kion]], who mastered the power of the [[Roar of the Elders]], manages to save him alongside the other animals from a gruesome fate.\n\n==Trivia==\n*He is the only named lemur to officially appear in [[The Lion King (franchise)|''The'' ''Lion King'' franchise]].\n**A lemur previously appeared in a ''Lion King''-inspired comic titled \"A Kinglike Hair-Do\" where a lemur appears briefly in the book; despite being set in the [[Pride Lands]], lemurs are only found in Madagascar in real life.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://lionking.fandom.com/wiki/Kely Kely] on [http://lionking.fandom.com/wiki Lion King Wiki].\n*[https://lionguard.fandom.com/wiki/Kely Kely] on [https://lionguard.fandom.com/wiki/The_Lion_Guard_Wiki The Lion Guard Wiki]\n\n{{The Lion King}}\n[[Category:Lemurs]]\n[[Category:The Lion Guard characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
