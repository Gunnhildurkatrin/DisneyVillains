When we think of Disney films, we feel a rush of nostalgia, as if we were watching one of those films with a bowl of cereal on a Sunday morning. We all have our favourite characters and we all have that one villain that we are a little bit afraid off. Therefore, it was an easy decision to take a further look into the villains of Disney, and explore the characters which we are still to this day gradually a little bit afraid of in a new light.
