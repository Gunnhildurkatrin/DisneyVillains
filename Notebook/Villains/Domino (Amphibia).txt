She was irreplaceable.|Anne|The Domino Effect}}\n'''Domino''' is [[Anne Boonchuy|Anne's]] cat who appears in the [[Disney Channel]] animated series, ''[[Amphibia]]''. Anne adores her so much that she gives her as much care as possible.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality and traits===\nLike any domestic cat, Domino likes to play and sleep during the day. Her favorite thing is a ball of yawn. Whenever she sees one she becomes intrigued by it. However, Domino can sometimes be vicious, especially when someone touches her tummy.\n\n===Phyriscal Appearance===\nDomino is a small black fluffy cat with white paws, six white whiskers, huge yellow eyes, white fur on her chest. In the first few episodes of season one, Domino was shown to have a splotch of white at the end of her tail. But by season three, her tail has been changed to just being black and fluffy.\n\n==Role in the series==\nThroughout seasons one and two, Domino has only been mentioned and seen in pictures and videos on Anne's phone. Domino makes her debut appearance in the third season premiere, \"[[The New Normal]]\". Along with [[Mr. Boonchuy|Mr.]] and [[Mrs. Boonchuy]], Domino comes up to Anne, who had just returned home. She brushed herself around her legs happy to see her owner again.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Domino was likely inspired by [[Matt Braly]]'s cat of the same name and physical appearance.\n*Anne found a caterpillar that looks like Domino and called it [[Domino II]].\n*According to Anne, Domino was a stray when she adopted her.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\">\nFile:Adventures in Catsitting promo by Matt Braly.jpg\nFile:Thai Feud and Adventures in Catsitting promo by Gina Garavalia.jpg\nFile:Adventures in Catsitting (11).jpg\nFile:Adventures in Catsitting (12).jpg\nFile:Adventures in Catsitting (3).jpg\nFile:Adventures in Catsitting (13).jpg\nFile:Adventures in Catsitting 1.jpg\nFile:Adventures in Catsitting (7).jpg\nFile:Adventures in Catsitting (9).jpg\nFile:Adventures in Catsitting (14).jpg\nFight at the Museum (2).jpg|Domino is sleeping with Polly\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*[[w:c:amphibiapedia:Domino|Domino]] at the [[w:c:amphibiapedia|Amphibia Wiki]]\n\n{{Amphibia}}\n[[Category:Amphibia characters]]\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
