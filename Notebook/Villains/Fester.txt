Although he is not always named, when he is given one, his first name is usually Fester.\n\n===Personality===\nFester is helpful to his friends. He also seems to care about the condition of those around him, as he is a dentist in \"[[Clan of the Cave Goof]]\".\n\n===Physical appearance===\nFester is an averagely built anthropomorphic dog of normal height with dark red hair. \n\nAs [[Goofy|Sir Goofy of Knock Knees']] sidekick, Fester wears a dark green tunic with a light green collar, light green leggings, dark green shoes, a black belt, and a dark green hat with an orange feather.\n\nAs Fester Ness, he wears a black suit with a red tie, black shoes, a gray fedora with a black band, and white gloves.\n\nAs Inspector Lestrade, he wears a trench coat, a yellow-and-black striped tie, light brown shoes, and a stalker cap.\n\nAs Fester Swollen, he wears a pink long-sleeved shirt, brown chaps, gray pants, dark brown boots, a gray cowboy hat with a black band, a yellow bandana, a black vest, and a black belt.\n\nAs the dentist in \"[[Clan of the Cave Goof]]\", Fester wears a bear skin strapped over one shoulder; a dark red cap with a bone fastened on top with three feathers, two blue and one dark red, tied to it; and a black wrist band.\n\n===Role in the series===\nHis only appearances are in the Goof History episodes. He normally is featured as the sidekick of the Goof family member the episode is about. \n\nIn \"[[Goofin' Hood and his Melancholy Men]]\", Fester is the unnamed leader (other than [[Goofy|Sir Goofy of Knock Knees]]) of the Melancholy Men. \n\nIn \"[[The Ungoofables]]\", Fester (with the last name \"Ness\") is an FBI agent.\n\nIn \"[[Sherlock Goof]]\", he is Inspector Lestrade.\n\nIn \"[[Gunfight at the Okie-Doke Corral]]\", he is again Fester (last name \"Swollen\").\n\nIn \"[[Clan of the Cave Goof]]\", he is once again an unnamed character, this time a dentist.\n\n==Trivia==\n*One of Fester's last names, Swollen, is likely a play on words. If a wound \"festers\" it may become \"swollen.\"\n\n{{Goof Troop}}\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Goof Troop characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]\n[[Category:Archers]]\n[[Category:Agents]]\n[[Category:Detectives]]"
