'''Experiment 501''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]]. She is designed to attack by spraying\u00a0blasts of water from her tentacles. Her one true place is creating a new island with [[Yang]].\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nAn experiment of few words, Yin was shown to be cocky, short-tempered and reckless before her rehabilitation. She is single-minded and will focus only on what's right in front of her, paying little heed to anything else going on around her. This clearly demonstrates\u00a0overconfidence in her own powers, as Yin considers them more than adequate to handle any threat. She is shown to not really care about other people's surroundings when using her squirting powers. However, she would defend her friends and ''[[Pelekai \u02bbohana|\u02bbohana]]'' loyally, alongside Yang.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nYin is a blue cephalopod-like experiment with eight water hose-like tentacles, a slug-like body, two small arms, black eyes and three tendrils on her head.\n\n===Special abilities===\nYin can absorb water into her head through her tentacles, and then release the stored water in powerful sprays when she wishes. It is also shown that when Yin and Yang combine their powers, they are able to create rock/land.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment 501 was the 501st genetic experiment created by Jumba with [[Jacques von H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. She was designed to spray surging water.\u00a0501 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch |Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai, with 501's pod landing in a palm tree.\n\n501's pod fell out of the tree and into a resident's pool below, activating the experiment. After the woman relaxing in the pool fled in fear, 501\u00a0absorbed the pool's water and, armed, set out to cause chaos.\n\n501 traveled to [[Lahui Beach|the beach]],\u00a0where she was soon discovered by a little boy. When the boy squirted 501 with a super-soaker, the latter responded by attacking him and the rest of the beach with blasts of surging water.\n\n501 later attacked [[Kokaua Town]]. [[Stitch]] tied 501's tentacles together to render her defenseless, but this only caused her pain and her\u00a0stored water to gush out and cause a flash flood.\n\nStitch's incompetence caused a rift between him and [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], and the two insisted that they each could catch an experiment without the other. After wagering an official contest, Stitch joined up with [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] while Lilo joined up with [[Pleakley]].\n\n501 was later chased by Lilo and Pleakley through a jungle, but the two failed to catch the former. While draining a pond to arm herself, Experiments 501 and [[Yang|502]] met for the first time. Jumba erroneously stated that if they both touched, Earth would likely be destroyed. However, they were ambushed and captured in containment orbs by\u00a0[[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] before they could make physical contact.\n\nWhile returning to [[Gantu's Ship|his ship]] with the two captured experiments, Gantu fell for a trap laid by [[Reuben|Experiment 625]], allowing 501 and 502 to escape.\n\nWhen Stitch later tracked 501 down to a backyard, the latter used a running tap to gain an infinite supply of water to use as ammo. However, her ammo ran out when Lilo turned the tap off, allowing Stitch to easily capture 501 in a container.\n\n501 and 502 were then rehabilitated, named Yin and Yang, and given a one true place using their combined powers to create a whole new island.\n\nYin reappeared in \"[[Elastico (episode)|Elastico]]\" as one of the audience members for Lilo's hula dance.\n\nIn \"[[Houdini (episode)|Houdini]]\", Yin was one of the audience members for Stitch's\u00a0bungled magic act.\n\nIn \"[[Finder (episode)|Finder]]\", \u00a0Yin was seen playing poker with Stitch, Yang, [[Richter]], and [[Cannonball]].\n\nIn \"[[Dupe (episode)|Dupe]]\", Yin was one of the experiments that came\u00a0to Lilo and Stitch's slumber party wearing a bathrobe\u00a0and matching nightcap. However, she was forced by Pleakley to leave due to her destructive behavior.\n\nIn \"[[Angel (episode)|Angel]]\", Yin was one of the experiments that\u00a0[[Angel]] reverted to evil using her song. Later, Yin and the other depraved experiments attacked Stitch aboard a ship, but Angel turned them back to good before they could finish Stitch off. Working together, the experiments were then able to successfully escape the ship with Stitch.\n\nYin reappeared in \"[[Slugger (episode)|Slugger]]\" as part of Lilo's softball team.\n\nIn \"[[Shoe (episode)|Shoe]]\", Yin was one of the experiments that helped turn [[Jumba's Ship|Jumba's ship]] into a hotel.\n\nYin was one of the experiments in \"[[Checkers (episode)|Checkers]]\" that joined Stitch in a rebellion against Gantu. Earlier in the episode, she, along with [[Digger]] and [[Backhoe]], helped Lilo make mud.\n\nIn \"[[Ace (episode)|Ace]]\", when [[Mortlegax]] arrived on Earth to decide whether or not Jumba was still evil, Yin and Yang posed as mutant creations as part of a hoax to fool the head of E.G.O. industries.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nIn the film's opening, Yin can be seen waving hello to [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], along with [[Yang]] and [[Cannonball]]. She was also seen later in the movie creating a new island with Yang as Lilo was making her rounds with [[Scrump]] to make sure all the experiments were happy in the one true place they belonged.\n\nLater, the first 624 experiments, including Yin and Yang, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, Lilo, [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]] and Gantu arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nYin and Yang participated in the following battle between the experiments and the Leroy clones by using their combined powers to encase Leroys in rock. Yin also sprayed water at Leroys until a Leroy clone completely tied her up, leaving her powerless and Yang to fight on his own.\n\nHowever, the Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.\n\n===''[[Stitch!]]''===\nYin made an appearance in the ''Stitch!'' anime special ''Stitch and the Planet of Sand''.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink|Yin/Gallery}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Yin was first revealed in a DVD bonus feature of ''[[Stitch! The Movie]]'' in the experiment gallery.\n*Yin is tied with Millie for the most limbs out of any known experiment, both with ten. Yin has eight tentacles and two tiny arms, while Millie has eight tentacle-like arms and two\u00a0tentacle-like legs.\n*Yin and [[Huggo]] are the only known experiments based on cephalopods. Though given Huggo and [[Thresher]]'s uncanny resemblance, Thresher may also be cephalopod-like.\n*Lilo referred to Yin as a male in ''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''. In the episode \"[[Dupe (episode)|Dupe]]\", Yin wore a pink bathrobe and nightcap to Lilo and Stitch's slumber party, but this still did not officially confirm this experiment's gender. Yin's true gender would not be re-confirmed as female until September [[2018]] and January [[2019]] in the respective [[Japan]]ese and global versions of the mobile game ''[[Disney Tsum Tsum (game)|Disney Tsum Tsum]]'', during a ''Lilo & Stitch: The Series''-themed event in the game that featured Yin and other experiments.\n*Her name is derived from the concept of {{WikipediaLink|Yin and yang|yin and yang}}; in this case her name stems from the force of yin, which is associated with femininity, water and cold, fitting her nature.\n*Though Yin apparently has no visible\u00a0mouth, a mouth is seen on her in \"[[Angel (episode)|Angel]]\" when she and other experiments carry Stitch out of a ship.\u00a0A mouth also appears on Yin in a few scenes of \"[[Slugger (episode)|Slugger]]\", especially during Lilo and [[Mertle Edmonds|Mertle]]'s argument over the game rematch.\n*Yin's [[Experiment Pods|pod]]\u00a0color is blue.\n*Her number was also given to [[Richter]] (in \"[[Ace (episode)|Ace]]\"), most likely due to Jumba's untidy [[Jumba's Computer|database]].\n*Yin's head and body appear in\u00a0the\u00a0online game\u00a0''[[Jumba's Lab (Game)|Jumba's Lab]]''.\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]"
