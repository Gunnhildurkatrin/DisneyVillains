Scrooge points out that the spirit is now older. The ghost explains his time on earth is very brief and that it ends at midnight.\n\nFinally, the ghost warns Scrooge about [[Ignorance and Want]]. Specifically, in what peril poor people would be if Scrooge did not change his ways. After his meeting with Scrooge is over, the Ghost of Christmas Present erodes into a skeleton, which soon turns into dust as it blows away. The nearby clock tower strikes 12 and Scrooge meets [[The Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come|the next ghost]].\n\n==Appearances in Disney media==\n===[[DuckTales (2017 series)|''DuckTales'' (2017)]]===\nA version of the Ghost of Christmas Present appears in the 2017 reboot of ''[[DuckTales (2017 series)|DuckTales]]'' in the episode \"[[Last Christmas!]]\" voiced by [[Bill Fagerbakke]]. This version is depicted as an anthropomorphic pig and is no bigger than [[Scrooge McDuck]] himself (as opposed to most portrayals that have him as a towering man).\n\nHe, along with the Ghosts of Christmas Past and Future visit [[Scrooge McDuck]] every year just to hang out after accidentally visiting him instead of Ebenezer Scrooge. The group take Scrooge to his first Christmas party held at McDuck Manor where Present attempts to hit on [[Bentina Beakley]], then still going by the name Agent 22, but fails as she ends up dancing with Future. When the [[Beagle Boys]] break in and begin stealing Scrooge's things, Present ends up leaving with them as he thinks they are more fun.\n\nHe later attends Scrooge McDuck's Christmas party back in the present.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"200\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nGhost of Christmas Present.jpg\nCarol-disneyscreencaps com-6171.jpg\nCarol-disneyscreencaps com-6646.jpg\nCarol-disneyscreencaps com-6671.jpg\nCarol-disneyscreencaps com-6847.jpg\nCarol-disneyscreencaps com-6897.jpg\nCarol-disneyscreencaps com-7009.jpg\nCarol-disneyscreencaps com-7020.jpg\nCarol-disneyscreencaps com-7056.jpg\nCarol-disneyscreencaps com-7160.jpg\nCarol-disneyscreencaps com-7179.jpg\nCarol-disneyscreencaps com-7094.jpg|[[The Ghost of Christmas Present|The Ghost's]] corpse behind Ignorance\nMuppets Ghost of Christmas Present.png\nDuckTales Ghost of Christmas Present.png\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Willie the Giant]] - Portrayed the role in ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]''.\n*[[Rolly]] - Portrayed the role in the ''[[101 Dalmatians: The Series]]'' episode ''[[A Christmas Cruella]]''\n*Narrator - Portrayed the role in ''[[Winnie the Pooh: Springtime with Roo]]''.\n\n{{A Christmas Carol}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ghost of Christmas Present, The}}\n[[Category:A Christmas Carol characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Dickensian characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:English characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Holiday Figures]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:The Muppet Christmas Carol characters]]\n[[Category:Spirits]]\n[[Category:Pigs]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:DuckTales characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]"
