Once Kristoff notices them, the trio begin rushing off and the wolves chase after the group immediately. Kristoff and Anna are able to fight them off, though they nearly succeed in devouring Kristoff. Fortunately, a cliff is in the distance, which the trio are able to jump across, thereby saving themselves from the pack. The wolves are not seen for the rest of the film.\n\n===''[[Olaf's Frozen Adventure]]''===\nAfter [[Olaf]] and Sven get separated from each other following the burning of [[Kristoff's Sled|Kristoff's sled]], Olaf tries to take what he believes is a shortcut to Arendelle through the woods, where he comes upon the wolves' territory. Once he is out of sight, a wolf is heard howling, and Olaf apparently sees some wolves while Initially mistaking them for puppies, Olaf quickly. Upon hearing the wolves growling and Olaf screaming, Sven realizes Olaf is in trouble, and hurries back to Arendelle to warn everybody. While Elsa, Anna, and Kristoff organize a search party, Olaf is still being chased by the wolves, as they are apparently interested in the fruit cake he is carrying. He finally manages to get away through a small open space that is blocked by trees, cutting the wolves off and preventing them from following him.\n\n===''[[Once Upon a Snowman]]''===\nAlmost immediately after leaving [[Oaken]]'s [[Wandering Oaken's Trading Post and Sauna|store]] with a sausage for his nose, Olaf hears the sounds of wolves growling and snarling behind him. A pack of them chase Olaf through the woods, mainly to try and get the sausage. But when they come across Anna, Kristoff, and Sven, they begin chasing them instead. Shortly after Olaf falls off the cliff and into the ravine where Kristoff's sled is destroyed, a lone wolf approaches him. Noticing it looking at the sausage while whimpering in hunger, Olaf empathetically gives his now-broken nose to the wolf. After eating the sausage, the wolf thanks Olaf by happily licking and snuggling with him before it leaves. \n\n==Video games==\n===''[[Frozen Free Fall]]''===\nIn ''Frozen Free Fall'', a wolf appears howling on the map of levels. In some levels starting from level 97, there are wolf tiles which must be destroyed by making matches next to them. After all of the crystals have settled in each move, the tiles randomly change position.\n\n===''[[Frozen: Olaf's Quest]]''===\nThe wolves appear as obstacles to [[Olaf]] in the game ''Frozen: Olaf's Quest''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nfrozen-disneyscreencaps com-4865.jpg|The wolves come out of hiding.\nfrozen-disneyscreencaps com-4901.jpg|One snaps in Kristoff's face.\nWolves-kristoff-anna.jpg\nFrozen-disneyscreencaps.com-4907.jpg\nfrozen-disneyscreencaps com-4912.jpg\nFrozen-disneyscreencaps.com-4918.jpg|Kristoff hangs on.\nfrozen-disneyscreencaps com-4920.jpg\nFrozen-disneyscreencaps.com-4930.jpg|A close encounter.\nfrozen-disneyscreencaps.com-4931.jpg\nfrozen-disneyscreencaps com-4985.jpg\nfrozen-disneyscreencaps com-4986.jpg\nfrozen-disneyscreencaps com-4987.jpg|Before the cliff.\nfrozen-disneyscreencaps com-5000.jpg|The wolves lose their lunch.\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Since their debut, the wolves have been commonly used as recurring enemies in ''Frozen'' spin-off material.\n*They might be a homage to the [[wolves]] from ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]''.\n**A further similarity can be seen when their howling causes Anna's horse to become startled and leave Anna behind by accident, similar to when [[Philippe]] the horse becomes frightened by the sounds of the wolves and leaves [[Maurice]] behind.\n**Similar to the wolves in ''Beauty and the Beast'', the wolves behaved unrealistically. In reality, wolves are usually more scared of humans and tend to keep their distance. The exception of their behavior in the film is if they're ''very'' hungry, considering the rapid shift to winter conditions during the apex of summer. This could be a possible explanation of their behavior in the film with the migration or starvation of the animals they would normally feed on. However, while wolf attacks in America are rare with only two predatory attacks ever recorded, the wolf subspecies of Europe, Asia, Russia, and the Middle East have a long history on preying on humans.\n*In real life, adult wolves usually don't have blue eyes. Rather, wolves are born with blue eyes that gradually turn into other colors as they grow older, such as gold, amber, yellow, copper, or green. Blue or dark-brown eyes is a sign of dog inheritance.\n\n==External links==\n*{{Interwiki|https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/frozen/images/6/64/Favicon.ico|Frozen|Wolves|Frozen Wiki}}\n{{Frozen}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Wolves}}\n[[Category:Frozen characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Wolves]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Disney on Ice characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
