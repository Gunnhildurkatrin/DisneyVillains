"{{Infobox character\n|name = The Refrigerator Police\n|image = 959f7b28e48b1e1cf6587daae4d20c3b.jpg\n|rides = [[Food Rocks]]\n|inspiration = The Police|voice = [[Jess Harnell]] (Milk carton)}}'''The Refrigerator Police''' are characters that performed in the former [[Food Rocks]] attractions at [[Epcot]].\n\nThey are parody of the English rock band [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Police The Police], performing [[Every Bite You Take]], a parody of \"Every Breath You Take\".\n\nThe trio is comprised of:\n*A low fat milk carton on lead vocals\n*A yogurt cup playing a stick of celery like a guitar\n*A milkshake cup playing the drums\n\n==Trivia==\n*The low fat milk carton figure was previously used as [[Mr. Dairy Goodz and his Stars of the Milky Way|Mr. Dairy Goods]] in [[Kitchen Kabaret]]. Despite the perceived significance of being the one recognizable figure to appear in both shows, his skeletal remains would end up on [[Ebay]] and briefly materialize during a [[2010]] fan event at the [[Disneyland Hotel]].\n*[[Sting]] was approached to record his own voice for the low fat milk carton, but after hearing Jess Harnell's soundalike demo track, he was impressed enough to deem it unnecessary. This also happened with Peter Gabriel and [[Pita Gabriel|his character]].<ref>https://twitter.com/TammyTuckey/status/1287487601323147264</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references />{{CharacterStub}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Refrigerator Police, The}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Foods]]\n[[Category:Food Rocks characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Bands]]\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Character trios]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]"
