She was dedicated to Arthur enough to save him from the wolf (thus showing that she also has the redeeming trait of being rather resourceful in a dangerous situation). She was heartbroken when she learned Arthur was not a squirrel but a human boy.\n\n==Role in the film==\nIn [[The Sword in the Stone|the film]], the little girl squirrel is first seen meeting Arthur as a squirrel eye to eye, face to face, when the both of them were running up to each other. After greeting her with a smile, Arthur then looked down both ways, and the female wouldn't let him get by, at first thinking she wanted to move past him. Immediately after moving out of her way, she came to and started sniffing him, then after he placed his hands on her nose to keep her away, she did the same to him and tried to keep his hands on her, thinking it was a game. Merlin confirmed for Arthur that she had become in love with him. Later, she keeps pestering him, even though Arthur tried to keep her away from him and told her that he was a human boy, not a squirrel, but she either didn't understand him or was too excited to listen. She even grabbed him by the face and kissed him (three times). Also, when Arthur put her tail on herself, pushed her and ran off, she picked it up and looked at Arthur while giggling, and then chittered, \"Ooohh!\" (like an in-love sound).  Also, while chasing Arthur (who hid in [[Merlin]]'s tail), the little girl squirrel went over to Merlin and smiled (which meant that she kindly asked him where Arthur went), and Merlin pointed at his tail, and the squirrel found Arthur and continued\u00a0harassing and chasing him all over the place, with Merlin singing \"A Most Befuddling Thing\".\n\nWhilst still chasing Arthur, when she saw the [[The Hungry Wolf (The Sword in the Stone)|wolf]] getting ready to eat him, she saved Arthur by biting the wolf's leg, causing him to yelp in pain. He then chased her, trying to bite her tail, but she managed to escape by making the wolf fall down a hill into a log and end up floating down a river stuck in the log.\n\nThe female squirrel was then found behind a rock nuzzling Arthur, glad that he was still alive. However, when Arthur turned back into human form (thanks to Merlin), she was heartbroken, ran up to her tree hole, and started crying. She tearfully watched as Arthur and Merlin headed back to the castle from her treetop. Her fate remains unknown after this as she is not\u00a0seen again in the rest of the film.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\">\nSword-in-stone-disneyscreencaps.com-4655.jpg\nSword-in-stone-disneyscreencaps.com-4667.jpg\nSword-in-stone-disneyscreencaps.com-4680.jpg\nSword-in-stone-disneyscreencaps.com-4686.jpg\nsword-in-stone-disneyscreencaps.com-4691.jpg\nSword-in-stone-disneyscreencaps.com-4724.jpg\nSword-in-stone-disneyscreencaps.com-4759.jpg\nSword-in-stone-disneyscreencaps.com-4778.jpg\nSword-in-stone-disneyscreencaps.com-4814.jpg\nSword-in-stone-disneyscreencaps.com-4844.jpg\nSword-in-stone-disneyscreencaps.com-4886.jpg\nSword-in-stone-disneyscreencaps.com-4958.jpg\nSword-in-stone-disneyscreencaps.com-4979.jpg\nSword-in-stone-disneyscreencaps.com-5068.jpg\nSword-in-stone-disneyscreencaps.com-5073.jpg\nSword-in-stone-disneyscreencaps.com-5105.jpg\nSword-in-stone-disneyscreencaps.com-5318.jpg\nSword-in-stone-disneyscreencaps.com-5333.jpg\nsword-in-stone-disneyscreencaps.com-5334.jpg\nSword-in-stone-disneyscreencaps.com-5356.jpg\nSword-in-stone-disneyscreencaps.com-5367.jpg\nSword-in-stone-disneyscreencaps.com-5385.jpg\nSword-in-stone-disneyscreencaps.com-5389.jpg\nSword-in-stone-disneyscreencaps.com-5424.jpg\nSword-in-stone-disneyscreencaps.com-5509.jpg\nSword-in-stone-disneyscreencaps.com-5516.jpg|Girl Squirrel sees that Arthur is not a squirrel anymore as he is a human boy\nSword-in-stone-disneyscreencaps.com-5524.jpg\nsword-in-stone-disneyscreencaps.com-5574.jpg|Girl Squirrel crying\nsword-in-stone-disneyscreencaps.com-5603.jpg|Girl Squirrel watching Arthur leaving\n</gallery>\n\n===Merchandise===\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\">\nSwordsquirrels.jpg|Pin of Arthur and Merlin (as squirrels) with the female squirrel\n48fc037f7424e 53443n.jpg\nThe Sword in the Stone.jpg\nSwordintheStonePoster.JPG\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*While not officially named in the movie, many fans have taken to calling the character '''Hazel'''.<ref name=\"Hazel1\">https://www.deviantart.com/touristism/art/Arthur-and-Hazel-Once-and-Future-325221754 4 September 2012</ref><ref name=\"Hazel2\">https://www.deviantart.com/laserenity/art/Squirrel-from-The-Sword-in-the-Stone-328505034 21 September 2012</ref>\n*When the Girl Squirrel sees that the [[The Hungry Wolf (The Sword in the Stone)|wolf]] is about to catch Arthur.
