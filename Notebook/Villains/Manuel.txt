He is best friends with [[Chico]].\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Beverly Hills Chihuahua]]''===\nManuel and [[Chico]] come across [[Chloe]] while she is taking a bath in a fountain. Manuel gets Chico to make it look like he is eating him. Chole manages to\u00a0convince Chico to spit out Manuel. They then trick\u00a0Chloe by talking her into giving them her diamond collar and lying about giving it back to her. Wearing the diamond collar, Manuel and Chico gloat over their latest con until\u00a0they are confronted by [[El Diablo]]. He demands to know where the Chihuahua is, so Manuel tells him and Diablo runs off. Later in a store, Manuel and Chico are discovered inside the pi\u00f1ata they were hiding in. After a funny chase, they manage to get away from the broomstick-wielding owner, but drop the diamond collar, which the owner keeps. Manuel and Chico, wanting the collar back, sneak into Sam's car after he and Rachel ask the store owner about Chloe's diamond collar that he found. Sometime later, Manuel and Chico help [[Delgado]] by presenting him with Chloe's collar. Delgado sniffs it several times, gets his sense of smell back, and goes to find Chloe. At the end, it is revealed that Manuel and Chico\u00a0move (stow away) to Beverly Hills\u00a0and become rich.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\">\nbhchihua015.JPG|Manuel with Chico\nPG35_6.jpg|Manuel and Chico scared of [[El Diablo]]\nVlcsnap-7199280.png|Manuel and Chico trying to escape El Diablo\nInfbhc107576211316tf9.jpg|Manuel and Chico sad\n</gallery>\n\n{{Beverly Hills Chihuahua}}\n[[Category:Rats]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Beverly Hills Chihuahua characters]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]"
