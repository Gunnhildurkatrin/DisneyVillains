However, unlike those who are civil toward Milo, Elliot is openly delusional and hostile toward Milo. He sees him as a danger to [[Danville]]. He is also shown to be arrogant, always stating that it is his duty as an enforcer for public safety to protect Danville from Milo, despite that he is just a volunteer crossing guard.\n\nElliot is very obsessed in watching what Milo gets up to, even putting Milo's name on the back side of his stop sign to mean business. He ensures everyone and anyone that he will always have his eyes on Milo no matter what.\n\n===Physical Appearance===\nElliot has dark fair skin and light brown hair. He has a slender figure, and is probably in his late twenties. He wears a safety jacket with two badges on his chest, and wears a white top underneath.
