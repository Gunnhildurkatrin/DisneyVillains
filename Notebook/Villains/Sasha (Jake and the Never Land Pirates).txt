In this episode, [[Red Jessica]] called for [[Captain Hook]]'s presence, much to the lovestruck captain's delight. Unfortunately for him, he was called over only to catsit Red Jessica's hydrophobic kitten,\u00a0[[Rosie (Jake and the Never Land Pirates) |Rosie]], while she ran errands on the sea. But as soon as\u00a0Red Jessica's departs, Captain Hook loses Rosie in the jungle of [[Crimson Isle]], and so needs the help of both his and\u00a0[[Jake (Pirate)|Jake]]'s crew to find her. They finally found the kitty playing on top of the sleeping tiger, Sasha, and Captain Hook had to muscle enough courage to rescue Rosie from Sasha's grasp. Sasha awakened with a roar, and the pirates escaped using [[Izzy]]'s [[Pixie Dust |pixie dust]] before Red Jessica got back. When Red Jessica returned, she was delighted to see that Hook has taken a liking to her kitten, and decided to introduce him to her other \"kitty\"- her tiger Sasha, which sends Hook fleeing back to the [[The Jolly Roger|Jolly Roger]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*\"[[Hook and the Itty-Bitty Kitty]]\"\u00a0(First appearance)\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nRedJess22.jpg\nSasha01.jpg\nRedJess21.jpg\nHook-Rosie-Sasha-Hook and the Itty-Bitty Kitty.jpg\nRed Jessica-Rosie&Sasha-Hook and the Itty-Bitty Kitty.png\nSasha&amp;Rosie-Hook and the Itty-Bitty Kitty01.png\nHookRed Jessica-Rosie&Sasha-Hook and the Itty-Bitty Kitty.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Jake and the Neverland Pirates}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Tigers]]\n[[Category:Jake and the Never Land Pirates characters]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
