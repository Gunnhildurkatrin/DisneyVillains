For the character of the same name from [[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]], see [[Esmeralda]].''\n\n'''Esmeralda''' or '''The Great Esmeralda''' is the name given to a fortune-teller machine in [[Disneyland]].\n\n==Description==\nEsmeralda is a fortune-teller found in the Penny Arcade of [[Main Street, U.S.A. (Disneyland)|Main Street, U.S.A.]], being the automaton of a fortune-teller machine. She is portrayed as a stereotypical Romani woman fortune-teller who gives out fortunes to guests on cards when they insert coins to her stall. It is unknown if she is intended to be her own character but it is likely given the storytelling of Disneyland attractions.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===Disneyland===\nEsmeralda is one of three fortune-teller machines found in Disneyland Park. The other two being [[Fortune Red]] in [[New Orleans Square]] and [[Shrunken Ned]] in [[Adventureland]]. Her machine appears at the very front of the Penny Arcade on Main Street. The cards of her prophecies serve as a sort of merchandise for the park and are decorated with an eye symbol as-well as symbols of mystic items.\n\n====PlayDisneyParks Mobile App====\nWith the PlayDisneyParks app, you are rewarded with a story regarding the fortune tellers when activating them and get further interactions through the mobile app.\n\n====The Ghost Post====\nEsmeralda was a vital figure in the interactive Ghost Post interactive game at Disneyland. Here, guests had to start their mission by going to Esmeralda and being given three cards by the fortune-teller which would lead them to three ghosts trapped outside of the mansion who needed to be saved by guests on behalf of the [[Ghost Relations Department]]. These took guests to the Silver Spur shop in [[Frontierland (Disneyland)|Frontierland]], Fowler's Harbour on [[Pirate's Lair on Tom Sawyer Island|Tom Sawyer's Island]], and Fargo's Palm Parlour on Main Street.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Esmeralda's tarot cards each take their illustrations from one of the four stretching room portraits in the Haunted Mansion. Namely: the [[Tightrope Walker]] & alligator, [[Alexander Nitrokoff]], the three quicksand men, and [[Constance Hatchaway]] with [[George Hightower]]'s tomb.\n*Esmeralda is one of the few [[Disney Parks]] characters featured in Main Street, U.S.A.. Other examples being the [[Dapper Dans]], Professor Wu from [[The Nightmare Experiment]], and the audio-animatronic [[Abraham Lincoln]].\n*A character very much resembling Esmeralda who went by the moniker of Esmeralda the Great appeared in the [[Disney Junior]] show, ''[[Vampirina]]''.\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Esmeralda}}\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Romani characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Main Street, U.S.A.]]\n[[Category:Main Street, U.S.A. attractions]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Machines]]\n[[Category:The Haunted Mansion characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]"
