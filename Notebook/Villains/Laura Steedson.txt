She was replaced at the dance academy with Pierre Ladasterre. She was attended to by a helper as her illness had weakened her greatly. To help pass her time at home, she took care of her garden daily.\n\nShe was visited by [[Hay Lin]], who was seeking her dance advice. Laura sensed that Hay Lin was ready to give up and told her to endure. She then showed Hay Lin her outdoor garden. Laura told Hay Lin how just like nature and life, dance is an endless movement and struggle. After Hay Lin understood what she was talking about, Laura wanted her to dance in the garden. After Hay Lin hesitated, Laura danced instead and told her how the basics could help people endure pain and survive.\n\nHay Lin left her house several hours later but before she did, Laura gave her a task to do. She asked Hay Lin to deliver a letter to a friend for her, which Hay Lin happily accepted.\n\nShe passed away a little while later.\n{{-}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*Issue 075: As You Were, You Are Now\n*Issue 076: Earth\n*Issue 080: Emotions\n*Issue 084: Unique Movements\n*Issue 085: I am You (mentioned only)\n\n==Trivia==\n*Before her illness, she was always seen wearing pink.\n{{Template:W.I.T.C.H}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Steedson, Laura}}\n[[Category:W.I.T.C.H. characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:European characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]"
