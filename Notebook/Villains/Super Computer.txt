In order to find out what's the nicest thing they can do for their [[Linda Flynn-Fletcher|mother]], [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]] and [[Ferb Fletcher|Ferb]] build a super computer that can answer any question it is presented with. (\"[[Ask a Foolish Question]]\") It does so by analyzing data from all the events in the Tri-State Area and predicting what will happen.\n\n==Design and construction==\nThe super computer is built on a metallic platform, with a large C-like metal bar with many holes for the \"neck.\" It has two large TV's with green screens for eyes, and five computers close together with red screen for the mouth. It has many wires connecting the screens to the neck, and is plugged in an unknown location. It is shown how it was built in ''[[Buildin' a Supercomputer]]''.\n\n==Questions answered==\nThe questions are\u00a0''italicized''\u00a0and the Super Computer's answers are in\u00a0'''bold'''.\n*(Phineas)\u00a0''Okay, computer, are you ready to answer any question?''\u00a0'''Yes, my data is complete, my logic infallible.'''\n*(Phineas)\u00a0''What's 2 + 2?''\u00a0'''4.
