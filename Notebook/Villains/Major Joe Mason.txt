General Kane, the dictator of neighbouring country Costa Estrella, infiltrates her palace with his agents during her coronation rehearsal, and attempts to capture the royal family and take over the country. Major Mason whisks the princess away to safety via helicopter. Kane\u2019s agents however succeed in capturing her mother, Queen Sophia. The Princess Protection Program hides Rosalinda in Mason\u2019s home in [[Louisiana]], where she is to pretend to be a typical American teenager named Rosie Gonzalez.\n\nIn an attempt to trick Rosalinda into exposing her location, General Kane announces plans to forcibly marry Rosalinda\u2019s mother. Rosalinda is distraught and tells Mason's daughter, Carter, that she has decided to secretly return home. Knowing Costa Luna is still too dangerous, Carter secretly devises a plan to pose as Rosalinda and then use herself as bait to lure Kane into capture. Mr. Elegante, Rosalinda's royal dress designer, tells Kane that Rosalinda will be attending the homecoming dance and will be wearing a blue dress that he actually sends to Carter. In the meantime, Rosalinda agrees to help Carter behave like a princess by helping a group of girls dress up for the dance; The girls all wear masks, which helps Carter disguise herself as Rosalinda.\n\nAccording to plan, Kane and his agents mistake Carter for Rosalinda and lead her to Kane's helicopter the night of the dance. However, Rosalinda narrowly discovers and ruins the plan by exposing herself to Kane, insisting that this is not Carter's fight. Fortunately, agents of the Princess Protection Program, including Mr. Mason, have been waiting inside the helicopter and rescue both girls. The PPP agents quickly apprehend Kane and his henchmen and turn them over to the international authorities.\n\nAt the end of the movie, Rosalinda is crowned Queen of Costa Luna with Carter, Major Mason, Ed, Queen Sophia, and Mr. Elegante in attendance.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* He owns a bait shop called Joe's Bait Shack.\n* Before Rosalinda, he had saved an Indian princess named Chandra from a politically-motivated coup.\n\n== Gallery ==\n[[File:Princess-protection-program-disneyscreencaps.com-770-1439409968.jpg|thumb|220x220px]]\n[[File:Princess-protection-program-disneyscreencaps.com-1283-1439409738.jpg|thumb|220x220px]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Agents]]\n[[Category:Princess Protection Program characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel Original Movie Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]"
