He respects his boss so much that he can really get on the Inspector's nerves, always trying his best to help him out and doing the necessary precaution.\n\nAfter the diamond has been found and with the case closed, he regretfully handcuffs his boss with gentle apologies.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"180\">\nHerbie Goes to Monte Carlo 2.jpg\nInspector-Bouchet-Defeat.png|Fontenoy arrests his boss\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Love Bug}}\n[[Category:The Love Bug characters]]\n[[Category:Detectives]]\n[[Category:French characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
