Or a trap?|Greitzer to [[Cutler Beckett]]}}\n\n'''Greitzer''' is a character who appears in the [[2007]] [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] film, ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]''. He was a lieutenant serving in the East India Trading Company. He served as one of Cutler Beckett's officers aboard the HMS Endeavour.\n\n==Role in the film==\nPursuing the ''[[Black Pearl]]'', Endeavor went to the barrel with the body of the dead soldier of the company, bound from above. Greitzer helped Lord [[Cutler Beckett]], using a knife from his pocket, to cut the bottle from the wrist of one of the corpses.\n\nGreitzer the  noticed another body in the water, the path left by [[Will Turner]], so that Beckett would follow him. Greitzer doubted whether or not there was a traitor among the crew of the ''Pearl'', or if it was just a trap set by the pirates. Beckett told him that this was nothing more than a gambit of an experienced adversary, and ordered Greitzer to regulate the ''Endeavor'' course, hoping to catch up with the ''Pearl'' before their bodies run out.\n\nOnboaed the ''Endeavor'' during the battle at the maelstrom with [[Tia Dalma|Calypso]], Greitzer was present there. When the EITC soldiers were ready for the final stand, they attempted to destroy the ''Pearl'' along the Pirate Armada. When the ''[[Flying Dutchman]]'' came out of the water, and Will Turner, as the new captain, ordered to shoot at Endeavor, the Pearl also began to shoot at him. His fate is unknown, though is assumed that he died in the explosion Endeavor.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the revision screenplay draft for ''At World's End'', Greitzer was to either not be present during the destruction or not have any lines during the destruction of the ''HMS Endeavour''. For the final version, Greitzer was present during the destruction.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nBeckett Greitzer.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*[[w:c:pirates:Greitzer|Greitzer]] on [[w:c:pirates:Main Page|Pirates of the Caribbean Wiki]]\n\n{{Pirates of the Caribbean}}\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Pirates of the Caribbean characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Presumably Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
