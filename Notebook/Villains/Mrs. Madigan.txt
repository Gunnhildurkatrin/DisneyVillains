"{{Infobox character\n|name=Mrs. Madigan\n|image=Mrs. Madigan.png\n|shows=''[[The Suite Life of Zack & Cody]]''\n|actor=\n|actress=Susan Blakely}}\n'''Mrs. Madigan'''\u00a0is the music teacher at\u00a0Cheevers High School. She is only seen in the ''[[The Suite Life of Zack & Cody]]'' episode\u00a0\"Orchestra\". She is played by Susan Blakely.\n\n==Personality==\nMrs. Madigan is the music teacher at\u00a0Cheevers High School, and she is in charge of the grade 9 orchestra. She quite an angry person, yet she can show kindness, especially to the Russian violin prodigy,\u00a0Sergei. She has a poster of him at her house. Madigan has a son in the orchestra class, but it seems like she does not treat him any differently to the rest of the kids in the class. She also seems to have a severe dislike of\u00a0Zack Martin, because of the \"Beware of Zack\" sign in the teachers lounge. It is obvious that she consistently gets annoyed with Zack's antics.\n\n==Appearance==\nLike a lot of teachers, Mrs. Madigan has a typical \"teachers look\". She looks fairly old, maybe in her 50's, and she is only seen in casual, school appropriate clothing. She has short, blonde hair in a fringe style. She always wears a necklace.\n\n{{Suite Life}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Madigan}}\n[[Category:The Suite Life characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Schoolteachers]]"
