Dude was chasing Carlos until Carlos climbed up a tree since Carlos's mother, [[Cruella De Vil]] taught him to be cynophobic his whole life. But Ben gave Dude to Carlos and the two began to bond throughout the movie.\n\nDuring the video chat with the evil parents, Cruella De Vil is surprised to see Carlos with him. She says he would make perfect earmuffs but Carlos steps up and tells his mother that they love each other.\n\nAt Ben's coronation as Maleficent attacks, Carlos sends Dude to jump on her to prove good is stronger than evil. Maleficent is appalled by Dude's dog breath.\n\nIn ''Descendants 2'', due to Dude ingesting a truth gummie Mal had made for Carlos he is granted the ability to talk, sometimes rather bluntly. While Ben goes to the Isle with Evie, Carlos, and Jay to get Mal back, Carlos tells Dude to stay home, and says the Isle is way too dangerous. Dude happens to stow away even though he failed obedience class.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The dog who portrayed Dude was a female dog named Paisley.\n*His first appearance outside of the Descendants franchise is in the ''Pup Academy'' episode \u201cMy Uncle is Dude\u201d.\n*Dude is the fourth De Vil pet in Disney adaptations, the others being [[Scorch]] and [[Vendella De Vil|Vendella]] in ''[[101 Dalmatians: The Series]],'' [[Fluffy (102 Dalmatians)|Fluffy]] in ''[[102 Dalmatians]],'' and [[Buddy (Cruella)|Buddy]] and [[Wink]] in Cruella.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nDescendants-103.png\nDid You Know - Dude.jpg\nDescendants-132.jpg\nCarlosDudeC.jpg\nDescendants 2 - Carlos and Dude.png\nIMG 1926.JPG|On the pirateship in ''Descendants 2''\nDescendants 3 - Photography - Dude and Celia.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Descendants}}\n[[pt-br:Dude]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Descendants characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel Original Movie Characters]]"
