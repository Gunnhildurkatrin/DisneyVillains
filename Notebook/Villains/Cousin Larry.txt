He is the nerdy cousin of [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim Possible]].[[File:Larry Close Up.jpg|thumb|250px]]\n[[File:Cousin Larry.jpg|thumb|250px]]\n[[File:Larry with helmet.jpg|thumb|250px]]\n[[File:Cousin Larry adjusting Glasses.jpg|thumb|250px]]\n\n==Background==\nLarry is the extreme stereotype of a \"nerd\"; he is completely obsessed with several classic non-mainstream topics such as comic books, science fiction movies and novelizations, and fantasy role-playing games. He exhibits poor social skills, at times has difficulty telling the difference between reality and fantasy, and has an extensive collection of action figures in his room.\n\n===Powers and Abilities===\nLarry is an expert or knowledgeable in many stereotypical \"nerd\" topics such as comic books, science fiction movies and novelizations, fantasy role-playing games, computer games, and robotic fight clubs.\n\n==Role in the series==\nLarry has helped Kim and Ron during several of their missions.\n\nThe first instance of this was to help [[Ron Stoppable|Ron]] when he was left to face [[Monkey Fist]] by himself when [[Wade]] sent a hologram of Kim on the mission without telling Ron.\n\nThe next instance of Larry helping Kim and Ron on a mission was when they needed access to the underground Robot Rumble to meet [[Vivian Francis Porter]]. Larry was a member of the Robot Rumble and Kim and Ron used him to gain access to the event. However, he was subsequently expelled from the club for bringing them in.\n\nThe last instance of Larry helping Kim and Ron on a mission was when [[Professor Dementor]] kidnapped Larry to try and obtain Kim's supersuit. Although, Larry believed that the entire thing was an elaborate role-playing game (RPG) scenario which Kim setup for his birthday.\n\nHe was also in Homecoming Upset, and met Queen Bonnie, although he did not do anything mission-wise in that episode. Ron quickly got him out of there before she insulted him, like she has been insulting all of the guys, who attended \"Meet The Queen\". In this episode, he and Ron were playing Netherworld, although not on screen.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Mother===\nJune is Larry's overprotective mother who believes that he still has to be watched, which is why she always makes Kim hang out with him.\n\n===Aunt===\n[[Ann Possible]] is Larry's aunt.\n\n===Uncles===\n[[James Timothy Possible|James Possible]] and [[Slim Possible]] are Larry's uncles.\n\n===Cousins===\nKim, Jim and Tim, and Joss Possible are Larry's cousins.\n\n===Friends===\nLarry is shown to play RPGs at the local comic shop and to be pretty popular with several of the customers there, including [[Ned]] from [[Bueno Nacho]].\n\nRon has also said that he chats with Larry from time to time and considers spending time with Larry to be fun.\n\n===Rivals===\nLarry has a rivalry with Charlotte, a regular at the local comic shop. Although later he was seen going to the movies with her, but being rebuked when he tried to put his arm around her.\n\n==Trivia==\n*While Larry shows an incredible breadth and depth of science fiction and fantasy knowledge, he apparently does not read ''original'' science fiction or fantasy novels since he tells Kim that he only reads \"novelizations\".\n\n==References==\n<references />\n{{Kim Possible}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Larry}}\n[[Category:Kim Possible characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Cousins]]\n[[Category:Nephews]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
