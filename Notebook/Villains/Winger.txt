She debuted in the episode \"[[Birds of a Feather (Jake and the Never Land Pirates)|Birds of a Feather]]\", where she met [[Skully]], and learned that she is a princess.\n==Role in the [[Jake and the Never Land Pirates|series]]==\nAs said above, she first appears in the episode, \"[[Birds of a Feather (Jake and the Never Land Pirates)|Birds of a Feather]]\". Here, [[Jake (Pirate)|Jake]] and his crew were atop [[Skull Rock]] watching the various parrots flying around socializing. A parrot named Winger meets Skully and asks him if he can help her find [[Skybird Island]]. Skully informs Jake and the crew is off. When they finally reach it, Winger meets the [[Wise Old Parrot]]; ruler of the kingdom. He informs Winger that she is the lost princess of the kingdom. She is crowned and the kingdom begins to rejoice. That all ends when [[Captain Hook]] arrives and tries to make off with her crown. Jake, Skully, and Winger chase after the captain, eventually defeating him and restoring peace to the Sky Bird Kingdom.\n\nIn the episode \"[[Skybird Island is Falling!]]\", Winger and Skully are enjoying each other's company eventually coming to the island's magic golden tree. Skully and Winger learn from the Wise Old Parrot that the island will plummet to the Never Sea without the tree's golden leaves. Winger then watches helplessly as the leaves are stolen by Captain Hook and his pirates. Jake, [[Izzy]], and [[Cubby]] appear to save the island to little avail. Winger and Skully eventually gather the island's natives and attack Hook stealing the leaves back in the process. Although the leaves are back in Winger's possessions, they may not be able to put the leaves back in time. Thankfully, Izzy's [[Pixie Dust|pixie dust]] is able to restore the leaves onto the branches. After the pirates return to Pirate Island, Winger sends a thank you message hoping to see the pirates again soon.\n\nIn \"[[The Queen of Never Land]]\", Winger and the [[Pirate Princess]] received a message from the mysterious Queen of Never Land. They were told that she's leaning towards retirement, and needs a princess to take the throne. They were also told to bring a gift, and she'll decide which will reign. Winger brought and beautiful song, whilst the Pirate Princess used diamonds to make a rainbow light show. However, the Queen was actually Hook in disguise, and the villainous Captain stole the Pirate Princess' diamonds even after his cover was blown. After the two princesses defeated Hook, the diamonds were returned, and Winger road off with the Pirate Princess on the latter's ship.\n\nWinger makes a minor speaking role in \"[[Sail Away Treasure]]\".
