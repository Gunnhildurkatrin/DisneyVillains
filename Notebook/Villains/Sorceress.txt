She was cursed to be trapped in a cave by [[King Triton]] himself, due to some unstated crimes. She conspires with [[Glowfish]] to get the Triton's trident and set herself free. She gives Glowfish a magic flute, which physically and mentally reverts Triton to a child. Glowfish, under the Sorceress' orders, lures Triton, now calling himself \"Red\", to her lair. The Sorceress attempts to act helpless and vulnerable in order to convince the young Triton to free her. Though he admitted that the Sorceress seemed familiar, as Triton had encountered her as an adult, \"Red\" remains unaware of the her danger. The Sorceress obtains the trident, but lacks the ability to use it to free herself. Luckily, the spell on Triton wears off, and he uses the trident to subdue her into remaining imprisoned. As the heroes depart, she swears vengeance on them.\n\n==Trivia==\n\n* The Sorceress is partly based on The Queen of The Night, a character from Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's opera ''The Magic Flute''. They share several striking similarities: They're both banished from their respective homelands, they both act vulnerable and helpless in order to convince a young hero to help them in their hour of need, and both give said hero a magic flute to help them on their \"journey.\" \n\n==Gallery==\n\ufeff<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nred74.jpg|The Sorceress with Glowfish\nred75.jpg\nred152.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Little Mermaid}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:The Little Mermaid characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Sea Monsters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Demons]]\n[[Category:Spirits]]\n[[Category:Sorceresses]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]"
