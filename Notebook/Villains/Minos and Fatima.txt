They use their monkey,\u00a0[[Abu]] to pickpocket their audience, but eventually hire the young Aladdin to do this instead. When Aladdin objects to stripping innocent citizens of all their money, Minos brings him in on their plan to steal the fabled Destiny Stone. Aladdin, Minos, Fatima, and Aziz go to the ruins where the Destiny Stone is kept.\n\nWhen the trio attempt to steal the Destiny Stone, they are instead trapped inside, while Aladdin and Abu escape. Many years later, the three of them escape. Minos has become a minotaur, Fatima has become a harpy, and Aziz has become a goblin. With their new found powers, the three of them go on a crime spree in [[Agrabah]], eventually setting their eyes on conquering the city and getting revenge on Aladdin for causing them to be trapped for many years.\n\nThey eventually return to the temple where the Destiny Stone was held, where after a brief conversation with [[Jasmine]], Minos and Fatima, who have mutual love for each other, decide not to kill Aladdin. This causes Aziz to turn against them and attack them with his magic breath, but Minos takes full blast shielding Fatima. Fatima finally sees that they had love, which was more than money or revenge as Minos dies in her arms. The Destiny Stone thus revives Minos and turns him and Fatima back into humans, while Aziz prefers to keep his powers. He escapes Minos and Fatima, but the two vow to pursue him in their atonement for their past crimes. Before leaving, they made their peace with Aladdin and Abu. They are both never seen or mentioned in the series again, but it is presumed they got their happily ever after.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n{{Aladdin}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Aladdin characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Middle Eastern characters]]\n[[Category:Greek characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Hybrids]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Those brought back to life]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]\n[[Category:Anti-villains]]\n[[Category:Cattle]]"
