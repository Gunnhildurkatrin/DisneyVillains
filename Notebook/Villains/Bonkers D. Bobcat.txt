Bobcat''' is the titular protagonist of\u00a0[[Disney|Disney's]] [[1993]]-[[1995|95]] animated television series with the [[Bonkers|same name]].\u00a0Originally featured on ''[[Raw Toonage]]'', he is a former star for cartoon shorts at Wackytoon Studios, an overly energetic and hyperactive, out-of-work, [[Toon]]\u00a0bobcat\u00a0who works in the Toon Division of the Hollywood P.D.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nBonkers mostly has the same personality as [[Roger Rabbit]]\u00a0as both go crazy in and out\u00a0[[Toontown]].\u00a0Bonkers is not the brightest or the most thinking cop in the station.\n\nThough Bonkers means well, he usually messes up cases for his fellow officers due to his lack of experience in law enforcement and his wild, exaggerated, cartoony nature. He even tells Lucky at one point that he is not good at logical police thinking because he is a Toon. It is interesting to note that not only does Bonkers make a design change between the 'Lucky' and 'Miranda' episodes, his personality is also slightly tweaked as well. Despite being a police officer, Bonkers is unarmed. However, he still carries a badge.\n\nIn the 'Miranda' episodes, he's portrayed as a rather clumsy, somewhat foolish character who ends up being the shows' punching bag. In the Lucky episodes, he's less of a buffoon and more of an Inspector Clouseau-type, in control of himself (though still hyperactive), and carries extensive knowledge about the Toons and their behavior, which is an asset on cases dealing with rogue Toons (Lucky would very rarely acknowledge this, although he knows it deep inside). The joke is his lack of law enforcement experience and procedure is still his \"Achilles' heel.\"\n\n===Physical appearance===\n[[File:Bonkers'_design_evolution.png|thumb|left|250px|The evolution of Bonkers' design.]]\nAs suggested by his surname, Bonkers is an anthropomorphic spotted orange bobcat with a red nose. In the ''Raw Toonage'' shorts, he was typically dressed in a green sweater. In the ''Bonkers'' series, his design is noticeably different between the two different sets of episodes. In the ''Raw Toonage'' shorts and the Miranda Wright episodes, Bonkers has large-knobbed ears and a spotted tail with a white tip, is shown to have blue eyes, and the spots on his fur are colored brown. In the Lucky Piquel episodes, his ears are smaller, his spots and eye pupils are black (though they are shown to be blue again throughout \"[[New Partners on the Block]]\"), and his tail is striped, somewhat resembling [[Tigger|Tigger's]]. In addition, his police uniform is different as well; in the Miranda episodes, Bonkers wears a smaller police cap with a different-looking badge than the one in the Lucky episodes, and most noticeably, the uniform is in two different shades of blue as opposed to the single shade of blue it was colored in the Lucky episodes.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Bonkers]]''===\nOnce a big star for a series of cartoons known as \"''He's Bonkers!''\" at Wackytoons Studios, Bonkers was a knobby-eared, Toon bobcat who was in love with his leading lady, [[Fawn Deer]]. He was almost never without his trusty companion, [[Jitters A. Dog]], and usually facing the threats of his arch-rival, Grumbles the Grizzly. Behind the scenes, his other friends included: [[Fall-Apart Rabbit]] (who served as his stunt-double), the [[Mad Hatter]] and [[March Hare]] (who served as his makeup artists), and his pet dog/horn\u00a0[[Toots]].\n\nSadly, however, Bonkers was fired due to his show being bumped out of first place in ratings. He was then introduced to law enforcement when he unknowingly saved cartoon celebrity [[Donald Duck]] from a dangerous park mugger, mostly due to the help of officer [[Lucky Piquel]], and was given full credit for the mugger's capture. For his actions, he was given the Citizen of Valor award by the Chief of Police, [[Leonard Kanifky]]. Bonkers, while soaking in the praise, told the chief of his experiences starring in a cop cartoon series which helped in the capture of the mugger. Chief Kanifky believed his story, taking it for granted, thinking that Bonkers would be a benefit to the police force, and asked if the Toon would like a job working for the Hollywood PD, which Bonkers accepted. Bonkers then requested Lucky Piquel as his partner and the two established the beginning of the Toon Division. However, in the meantime, all of Bonkers' old Toon friends mysteriously began disappearing, being kidnapped and brought into the hands of the evil [[The Collector|Collector]]. After solving the case, Bonkers' boss, [[W.W. Wacky]], was impressed and offered Bonkers his job back, but Bonkers refused, stating that he wanted to stay with Lucky, and thus, the Toon Division began. When Bonkers first came home to Lucky's house, he was treated as a sort of adopted son to Lucky.\n\nAfter the rescue and many other strange cases with Bonkers, Lucky moved to [[Washington, D.C.]] in order to become an FBI agent. Bonkers later worked alongside the police officers [[Miranda Wright]] and [[Sgt. Frank Grating|Sergeant Grating]], still remaining under Chief Leonard Kanifky.\n\n===Other appearances===\n[[Genie]] from ''[[Aladdin (1992 film)|Aladdin]]'' impersonated Bonkers in the [[Aladdin (TV series)|TV series spin-off]] episode ''[[Snowman is an Island]]''.\n\n[[File:Screenshot 20201019-142811 YouTube.jpg|thumb|250px|Bonkers in ''[[DuckTales]]''.]]Bonkers made a brief appearance in the reboot series of ''[[DuckTales (2017 series)|DuckTales]]'', in the episode \"[[Let's Get Dangerous!]]\". In the episode, when [[Darkwing Duck (character)|Darkwing Duck]], [[Launchpad McQuack|Launchpad]], and [[Gosalyn Mallard|Gosalyn]] are looking at the supervillains that came out of the portal through the computer, Bonkers is seen being hurt by each of the villains. While his design is similar to his appearances in the Lucky Piquel episodes, he has a black nose much like early promotional art for the character.\n\n==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==\nBonkers made regular appearances at [[Disneyland]] and [[Walt Disney World]] between [[1993]] and [[1996]], most notably starring in the Disney Afternoon stage show at Mickey's Starland in 1993 through 1996 and appeared in [[Disneyland Paris]] until [[2000]]. Bonkers has not been seen in the Disney Parks for many years after the initial airing of his show on the Disney Afternoon and is currently retired.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Bonkers shares a considerable amount of traits with [[Wander]]\u00a0from\u00a0''[[Wander Over Yonder]]'':\n** Both charcters are colored orange.\n** Both are very naive, hyperactive and zany.\n** Both charcters are constantly annoying a grumpy old guy ([[Lord Hater]]\u00a0for Wander and\u00a0[[Lucky Piquel]]\u00a0for Bonkers)\n** Both characters have also female partners that are much smarter than either of them ([[Sylvia]] for Wander and [[Miranda Wright]] for Bonkers).\n\n==External links==\n*[http://users.cwnet.com/xephyr/rich/dzone/hoozoo/bonkers.html Disney's HooZoo - Bonkers D.
