She is [[Madame Adelaide Bonfamille]]\u2019s palomino horse and a friend of [[Duchess]] and the kittens.\n\n==Role in the film==\nIn the movie, Frou-Frou is the horse of [[Madame Adelaide Bonfamille|Madame Bonfamille]] and a friend of [[Duchess]] and her kittens. In the beginning, she gives Madame, Duchess, and the kittens a ride back home from town. During which, she allows one of the kittens to ride on her back to which [[Berlioz]] thanks her for when they arrive at home. When [[Edgar]] the butler realizes that the cats will get Madame's fortune when she dies, he kidnaps them and takes them out into the countryside. Madame wakes up in the middle of the night and discovers the cats missing, much to her horror. She runs screaming, \"Duchess! Kittens! Where are you? They're gone!\" This wakes [[Roquefort]] up and he goes out to search for them.\n\nWhen Roquefort returns, he goes to see Frou-Frou in the barn, and she asks them if he found them. Roquefort replies that he didn't. Frou-Frou also informs him that Madame didn't sleep after discovering that Duchess and the kittens were gone. They are surprised when Edgar arrives in an unusually cheerful mood. He reveals to her that he's the catnapper because he made the headlines in the newspaper, much to Frou-Frou's disgust. Roquefort, who was hiding on top of Frou-Frou's head, also heard Edgar's words. But then Edgar realizes that he lost his hat and umbrella. As that could lead to evidence of him being the catnapper, he plans to get those things back by that night. After Edgar leaves Frou-Frou and Roquefort, they come up with a plan that Roquefort will hop on Edgar's motorcycle and ride along with him to get his hat and umbrella back, possibly leading Roquefort to where Duchess and her kittens. However, when Roquefort hops on, he accidentally bounces off as Edgar rides away like a maniac.\n\nThe next day when Duchess and the kittens return home with the help of an alley cat named [[Thomas O'Malley]], a shocked but determined Edgar traps Duchess and the kittens in a trunk and prepares to ship them to Timbuktu. But when he's about to push them outside, O'Malley jumps on Edgar's back and Frou-Frou grabs his coat tails with her teeth, but he manages to pull away from her. Still, she manages to block him from pushing the trunk outside with her front legs. Edgar chases O'Malley into a pile of hay and nearly stabs him to death with a pitchfork, much to Frou-Frou's horror. Then O'Malley's friends [[Scat Cat]] and his gang of [[Alley Cats]] show up and help free Duchess and her kittens. The cats trap Edgar by trapping him in Frou-Frou's horse collar, throwing a bucket of water on his head and hoisting him up on a rope. Finally, Frou-Frou kicks Edgar with her back hooves, sending him into the trunk. Then Frou-Frou and the cats watch as Edgar is shipped off to Timbuktu in the cats' place. In the end when Madame adopts O\u2019Malley and opens up her house for all the alley cats, including Scat Cat and his gang of alley cats, Frou-Frou appears singing \"[[Everybody Wants to Be a Cat]]\" during the celebration.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nTumblr n39vcfgAwi1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-38.jpg\naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-55.jpg|Frou-Frou with Berlioz\naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-105.jpg\naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-128.jpg|Frou-Frou with Madame\naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-170.jpg\naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-177.jpg\naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-3979.jpg|Frou-Frou and Roquefort sad that Duchess and the kittens are out of Madame's mansion\naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-4000.jpg\naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-4020.jpg|Frou Frou and Roquefort see Edgar arriving, in an unusually cheerful mood.\nAristocats-disneyscreencaps com-3826.jpg\naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-4034.jpg\naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-4059.jpg|Frou-Frou glares at Edgar\naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-4046.jpg\naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-4102.jpg|Frou-Frou whinnies as Edgar whacks her in the butt with his newspaper.\naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-4138.jpg\naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-5535.jpg\naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-5540.jpg\naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-5544.jpg\naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-5567.jpg\naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-8552.jpg\naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-8577.jpg|Frou-Frou protecting Duchess and her children from Edgar\naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-8591.jpg\naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-8629.jpg|Frou-Frou frightened and upset that Edgar left Thomas pinned on the wall\naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-8747.jpg|Frou-Frou pulling the rope to give Edgar his comeuppance. \naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-8759.jpg|Frou-Frou preparing to kick Edgar to the Timbuktu's box\nAristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-8780.jpg\nAristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-8798.jpg|Frou-Frou, Roquefort and Alley cats happy that Edgar is going to live in Timbuktu\naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-9073.jpg|Frou-Frou in \"[[Everybody Wants to Be a Cat]]\"\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*There is a possibility that she could be named after Frou-Frou, Vronsky's steeplechase mare in ''{{WikipediaLink|Anna Karenina}}''.\n\n{{The Aristocats}}\n[[fr:Frou-Frou]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Aristocats characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Horses]]\n[[Category:Farm animals]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:French characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Pets]]"
