She is a [[Gargoyle (creature)|gargoyle]], the leader of the [[London Clan]], and a merchant at ''Into the Mystic''.\n\n==Role in the series==\nBorn sometime before the Bombing of [[London]], Una grew up alongside her rookery brothers, [[Leo (Gargoyles)|Leo]] and [[Griff]]. She became the leader of her clan while running a magic shop with Leo, who, along with her, believed what happened outside the shop was none of their concern.\n\nGriff wasn't on the same page with them, believing strongly in the way of the Gargoyle: To Protect. Ignoring their pleas to stay home with them where it was safe, Griff would go out to help in the war-effort, leaving his family to worry about him, Una especially, hinting she had romantic feelings for him.   \nSometime during the war, Griff returned with a gargoyle who introduced himself as [[Goliath]], and Una was disheartened that Goliath would not help them convince Griff to stay out of the war. Instead, she settled with asking Goliath to protect Griff, to which he responded, to her confusion, he wouldn't let Griff die again.\n\nWhen neither Goliath nor Griff returned, Una and Leo were left heartbroken, believing they both perished during the war, and commissioned a monument in their honor.\n\nMany years later, Una and Leo still ran their magic shop and had become mates. Still they were convinced what happened outside the shop was none of their concern. They also managed to hide in plain sight as the locals believed them to be wearing costumes and masks. They would soon re-encounter [[Goliath]] again, who claimed he'd never met them before and knew nothing of their friend Griff. Outraged, believing Goliath was the cause of Griff's death and angered he would have the nerve to come back to them, they attacked Goliath and his fellow travelers, [[Elisa Maza|Elisa]], [[Angela]], and [[Bronx]], ending the confrontation with Una casting spells on them to knock them all unconscious. When Goliath woke up, they threatened he would never see his friends again. This whole experience finally persuaded Goliath to use the [[Phoenix Gate]] to uncover this baffling mystery. Disappearing into the past, Una and Leo believed Goliath had abandoned his friends like, as they believed, he abandoned Griff.\n\nThey confronted Elisa, Angela, and Bronx about this, but then Leo, to Una's shock, set them free. Leo then said to his mate perhaps they'd been blaming the wrong gargoyle for all those years. Una protested they were only protecting their home, but Leo responded, even if that was right, turning their back on Griff and his plight was wrong, and they accept perhaps it was their fault.\n\nBut they are granted a second chance when Goliath returns to the present with Griff, to their shock and happiness. Una apologizes to Goliath, who accepts it.\n\nAnd from that day forward, Una and Leo joined Griff in defending the good people of London from wrongdoers.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Her name is derived from the mythological creatures known as unicorns.\n*The spell Una used to knock Goliath, Elisa, Angela, and Bronx unconscious was \"Dormite, hostes mei, ubi statis\". (Latin for \"Sleep, my enemies, where you stand\".)\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.gargwiki.net/Una Una] at GargWiki\n\n{{Gargoyles}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Gargoyles characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Unicorns]]\n[[Category:Pegasi]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Mystical animals]]\n[[Category:Gargoyles]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]"
