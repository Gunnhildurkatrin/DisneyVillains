She is the mother of [[Jeremy Johnson]] and [[Suzy Johnson]] and wife of [[Jack Johnson]]. She is the sister-in-law of Joe Johnson and probably the daughter-in-law of Hildegard. She is also related to [[Annabelle Johnson|Annabelle]]. She is in the Free-Form Jazz Band alongside [[Linda Flynn-Fletcher]] and [[Vivian Garcia-Shapiro]]. She has appeared several times (mostly in background shots).\n\n==Relationships==\n===Family===\n====[[Suzy Johnson]]====\nSuzy and her mother have yet to be seen interacting but it is safe to assume that she is unnaware of Suzy's darker personality. \u00a0Its also assumed that Suzy is close with her mother as well.\n====[[Jeremy Johnson]]====\nIt appears that Jeremy and his mother are quite close and Jeremy often helps her with anything animal. (\"[[Misperceived Monotreme]]\", \"[[Bad Hair Day (Phineas and Ferb)|Bad Hair Day]]\")\n===Other===\n====[[Candace Flynn]]====\nShe gets a good impression of Candace after she \"saved\" a tangerine orangutan which happened to be [[Heinz Doofenshmirtz]] covered with Candace's hair.
