He was [[Mowgli]]'s adoptive father.\n\n==Background==\nRama is a member of a wolf pack that [[Bagheera]] is aquatinted with. At the beginning of the film, he and his mate [[Raksha]] had recently had a litter of pups. Due to his short appearance, his personality is not well developed. However, he treats [[Mowgli]] as his own adopted son and cares deeply for the boy's safety.\n\n==Role in the film==\nAs narrated by [[Bagheera]], the newborn Mowgli is taken to Rama and his mate in the hopes that they would care for the baby. While Raksha\u00a0is immediately enamored, and Rama accepts the boy, helping her to raise him for 10 years.\n\nWhen [[Shere Khan]] returns to the wolves' part of the jungle, Rama is present at a meeting meant to determine Mowgli's future. As Shere Khan has sworn to kill Mowgli and all who protected him, the wolf pack elders decide to send Mowgli away, as even the pack would not be\u00a0strong enough to face Shere Khan.\n\nRama complains in Mowgli's favor, stating that the boy is like his own son and thus\u00a0is entitled to the pack's protection. Rama also states Mowgli would likely not survive alone in the jungle. However, [[Bagheera]] volunteers to take Mowgli to a [[Man Village]] he knows of. Rama watches as Bagheera heads off.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the book, Rama was a name of a water buffalo and this character's name was just \"Father Wolf\".\n*His named after a Hindu Deity Rama, an avatar of the Hindu God Vishnu.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nJungle-book-disneyscreencaps.com-285.jpg\nJungle-book-disneyscreencaps.com-290.jpg\nJungle-book-disneyscreencaps.com-293.jpg\nJungle-book-disneyscreencaps.com-299.jpg\nJungle-book-disneyscreencaps.com-313.jpg\nJungle-book-disneyscreencaps.com-336.jpg\nJungle-book-disneyscreencaps.com-491.jpg\nJungle-book-disneyscreencaps.com-496.jpg\nJungle-book-disneyscreencaps.com-505.jpg\nJungle-book-disneyscreencaps.com-512.jpg\nJungle-book-disneyscreencaps.com-525.jpg\nJungle-book-disneyscreencaps.com-529.jpg\nJungle-book-disneyscreencaps.com-533.jpg\nJungle-book-disneyscreencaps.com-539.jpg\nJungle-book-disneyscreencaps.com-575.jpg\nJungle-book-disneyscreencaps.com-585.jpg\nJungle-book-disneyscreencaps.com-600.jpg\nClipakela.gif\nRama Concept Art.jpg|Rama concept art by [[Milt Kahl]]\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Jungle Book}}\n[[es:Rama]]\n[[fr:Rama]]\n[[nl:Rama]]\n[[Category:Wolves]]\n[[Category:The Jungle Book characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Indian characters]]"
