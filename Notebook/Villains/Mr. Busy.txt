He helps get [[Lady]]'s muzzle off.\n\n==Background==\n===Physical Description===\nMr. Busy looks and sounds almost identical to [[Gopher (Winnie the Pooh)|Gopher]] from the [[Winnie the Pooh (franchise)|''Winnie the Pooh'' franchise]], except he is large, has a big beavertail, and is brown instead of gray.\n\n===Personality===\nMr. Busy\u00a0is very kind and friendly, while still being a hard worker. He is also very helpful when he manages to remove [[Lady]]'s\u00a0muzzle by biting through it (after being persuaded by [[Tramp]]).\n===Physical Appearance===\nHe is an obese light tan brown beaver with a sienna muzzle and belly, a black nose, thick black eyebrows, a pair of 4 whiskers, short gray ears, both gray paws and feet with black claws, a flat gray tail and white buck teeth.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lady and the Tramp]]''===\nLady and the Tramp meet\u00a0Mr. Busy when trying to get Lady's muzzle off. A tree chewed down by Mr. Busy\u00a0nearly falls on them, and the Tramp barely warns Lady in time to get out of the way. They see him chewing down branches and sections of the tree in order to finish his dam. This gives the Tramp an idea on how to remove Lady's muzzle.\u00a0Mr. Busy\u00a0struggles to push the log that he chewed over to the spillway and originally refuses to listen to the Tramp, saying that he is busy, but the Tramp then shouts in Mr. Busy's\u00a0ear that he needs a log puller. This gets Mr. Busy's attention. The Tramp takes on the role of a salesman and convinces Mr. Busy\u00a0to bite the muzzle off, much to Lady's relief. Mr. Busy\u00a0starts pulling the log using the muzzle, which he believes to be a log puller. It works all too well and\u00a0Mr. Busy\u00a0is flung through the air, still attached to the log, and eventually lands in the water. The log floats over and completes the dam, much to Mr. Busy's delight. He isn't seen throughout the rest of the film.\n\n===''[[The Litterbug]]''===\nMr. Busy makes a cameo appearance along with the other forest animals (including two red robin birds, three dark blue possums, an eagle, a bear, a raccoon, and a moose), all of which were not pleased with [[Donald Duck|Donald]]'s littering and are seen holding a sign that says, \"Keep your Country Beautiful\".\n\n==Live-action appearances==\n===[[Lady and the Tramp (2019 film)|''Lady and the Tramp'' (2019)]]===\nAlthough Mr. Busy himself does not make a physical appearance in the Disney+ exclusive film, a beaver statue taking the role of the aforementioned character can be seen in the park scene. In it, Lady and Tramp go to the park to get the muzzle off her mouth where Tramp helps Lady remove her muzzle by using a beaver statue to pull it off.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Mr. Busy's model would later be used for [[Gopher (Winnie the Pooh)|Gopher]], a character from the ''Winnie the Pooh'' franchise. Coincidentally, both characters speak with the same accent. Some of the recycled animation of the beaver was also used for Gopher in ''[[Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree]]'' in one scene.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nLady-tramp-disneyscreencaps.com-4642.jpg\nLady-tramp-disneyscreencaps.com-4791.jpg\nLady-tramp-disneyscreencaps.com-4795.jpg\nThe Litterbug - Forest Animals.jpg|Mr. Busy's cameo appearance from Donald Duck's ''[[The Litterbug]]''\nSeptember27th.png|Mr. Busy's page in ''[[Disneystrology]]''\nMr. Busy modelsheet.jpg|Mr. Busy's model sheet\nLady Tramp Beaver Joe Rinaldi.jpg|Lady and Tramp with Mr. Busy by Joe Rinaldi\nCliplbeav.gif|Clip Art\nScreen Shot 2020-03-03 at 1.41.22 PM.png|Mr.Busy (Statue) in Live Action\nTramp and Mr. Busy Concept Art.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Lady and the Tramp}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Busy}}\n[[es:Castor]]\n[[fr:Castor (La Belle et le Clochard)]]\n[[nl:Mr. Bever]]\n[[pt-br:Castor (A Dama e o Vagabundo)]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Lady and the Tramp characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Beavers]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Zoo Animals]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]"
