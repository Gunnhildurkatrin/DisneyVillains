"[[File:IMG Ludwig 2.PNG|thumb|220x220px|Mrs. Von Drake's heirloom tableware.]]'''Mrs. Von Drake''' is the off-screen mother of [[Ludwig Von Drake]]. She lives near Ludwig's laboratory, and Ludwig has to keep down the noise of his inventions so as to not disturb his mother. Like Ludwig, she speaks with an Austrian accent, and makes use of the expression \"kooky\". She is voiced by [[April Winchell]].\n\nIn \"[[List of Mickey Mouse Works mini-shorts|Time Reverser]]\", Ludwig destroys his mother's priceless heirloom chinaware, to demonstrate how his time-reversing machine can reverse the damage, by traveling back in time to before the incident occurred. The invention, however, goes awry, and, left with only the shattered remains of his mother's tableware, Ludwig quickly goes out of his way to find some glue.\n\n[[File:IMG Ludwig 3.JPG|left|thumb|220x220px]]In ''[[Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse]]'' (in a segment that was later re-used in \"[[Pete's Christmas Caper]]\"), she is heard shouting at Ludwig again, during his lecture on \"The Science of Santa\".\n\nAccording to ''Wiener Schnitzel Woes'' (''[[Walt Disney's Comics and Stories]]'' #732), Mrs. Von Drake lives in Austria, and airmails her son one of her \"Wiener Schnitzel \u00e0 la Weltschmerz\" dishes every week when her son is teaching in Duckburg.\n{{Mickey Mouse Works}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse Works characters]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Duck Family]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Unseen characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]"
