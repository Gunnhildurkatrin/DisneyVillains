Like her sister [[Maggie Pesky|Maggie]], she has pink hair, but she can only say \"Gah\" and \"Goo\". She can\u00a0juggle, breakdance, and do ballet.\u00a0Bella doesn't have a big part in any episodes, except in \"[[Sister Act (The Buzz on Maggie)|Sister Act]]\". In all the others, she's often just sitting at the dining table. Although she doesn't have any arms, she has her own fork and glass.\n\n{{Buzz on Maggie}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pesky, Bella}}\n[[Category:The Buzz on Maggie characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Infants]]\n[[Category:Flies]]\n[[Category:Insects]]"
