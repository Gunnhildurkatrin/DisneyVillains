"[[File:Sea_Serpent_dragon.png|thumb|250px|A Sea Serpent in comparison to a Dragon.]]The '''Sea Serpent''' is a fictional creature seen in the television show ''[[American Dragon: Jake Long]]''.\n==History==\n\nThe Sea Serpent dwells in bodies of salt water, such as oceans and seas. Although it is considered [[Magic|magical]], it is more of a cryptid, a creature whose existence hasn't been recognized scientifically and is considered very unlikely. Only one appears in the entire series<ref name=\"frenzy\">[[Feeding Frenzy]]</ref>.\n==Physical Appearance==\nThe Sea Serpent is very similar to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oarfish oarfish] (rare eel-like creature) in that it has an elongated body and a viciously fanged mouth. Its cheeks have protruding fin-like crests and pairs of horn-like appendages coming out at the top of its head and under its lower jaw. It has orange spikes running all along its back and a forked tail tip. Interestingly, it also has two scaly wings that permit it to fly. When underwater, those wings are probably used as fins.\n==Life in the Magical World==\nUnlike most magical creatures, Sea Serpents are not capable of speech. They have kept their wild animal behavior and habits, acting mostly on instinct. If tamed, they can be used as a steed, as shown by [[Tibur\u00f3n]]<ref name=\"frenzy\">[[Feeding Frenzy]]</ref>. They are neither good nor bad and will simply follow their master's orders.\n\nOther than flight and the ability to breath underwater or on land, the Sea Serpent doesn't possess any special powers.\n\nBecause it is a marine creature, the Sea Serpent cannot live out of the water for too long. When the environment around it turns too dry for the serpent to tolerate, it will become dehydrated and start hyperventilating. Depending on the severity of its dehydration, the Sea Serpent might faint.\n\nTo restore its health, it must bathe in water until it has cooled off and regained its strength. It is possible for [[Dragon (Jake Long Universe)|Dragon]] to cause an early dehydration state to a Sea Serpent by mixing seawater and a firebreath to create hot steam.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Though this hasn't been confirmed, it is highly possible that Sea Serpents come in different forms and colors.\n*When Sea Serpents roar, they sing like whales.\n*At the end<ref name=\"frenzy\">[[Feeding Frenzy]]</ref>, [[Jake]] imprisons Tibur\u00f3n's Sea Serpent inside a water bubble. It is unknown if it was led to the shark prison or set free after the ordeal with Tibur\u00f3n and his gang.\n*The Gorgons ([[Fury Gorgon|Fury]], [[Euryale]], and [[Medusa Gorgon|Medusa]]) once turned a Sea Serpent into a slave along with a Unicorn, a Phoenix, and a [[Dragon (Jake Long Universe)|Dragon]].\n*The Sea Serpent is depicted to have wings in the show.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nSea_serpent_dehydrated.png|A dehydrated Sea Serpent.\n</gallery>\n==References==\n<references/>{{Template:American Dragon: Jake Long}}\n[[Category:American Dragon: Jake Long characters]]\n[[Category:Dragons]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
