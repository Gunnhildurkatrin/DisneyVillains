Good...\"}}The '''Magic Man''' is a supportive character and the secondary protagonist in ''[[James and the Giant Peach]]''. He narrates the film.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[James and the Giant Peach]]''===\nThe Magic Man is first seen after [[James Trotter|James]] rescues a [[Miss Spider|spider]] from being squashed by his two cruel aunts,\u00a0[[Aunt Spiker|Spiker]] and [[Aunt Sponge|Sponge]], and\u00a0wishes aloud\u00a0that he could get as far away from this place as possible. The\u00a0soldier addresses the boy by name. When James questions this, the\u00a0soldier\u00a0says that he knows more than just the boy's name. He then shows James a bag of magic green \"[[Crocodile Tongues|crocodile tongues]]\", which he gives to James to make his life better. The soldier describes that these magical \"tongues\" are \"boiled in the skull of a dead witch for 20 days and 20 nights. Add the fingers of a young monkey, the gizzard of a pig, the beak of a parrot, and three spoonfuls of sugar. Stew for a week, and then let the moon do the rest\". The soldier then tells James that \"marvelous things will happen\" if he accepts the \"tongues\", to which James agrees. The soldier then warns him not to lose the \"crocodile tongues\" because if they do, \"they'll work their magic on whoever or whatever they meet first\", and disappears.\n\nThe Magic Man is last seen near the end of the movie when James arrives in [[New York City]]. After\u00a0James and the [[Giant Peach|giant peach]] are rescued from the top of [[the Empire State Building]] by the police and firemen, his aunts arrive in their beat-up car and attempt to take back James and the peach. However, the soldier who\u00a0appears among the crowd of people declares aloud, \"Let the boy speak!\" to Spiker and Sponge.\n\nIt is also revealed\u00a0in the end that the Magic Man has been narrating the story the whole time since the beginning of the film, and then winks at the viewers before the end credits start to roll.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n<gallery>\nUp here.jpg\nAre in here,.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n\n\n\n==Trivia==\n*Although the Magic Man knew James' name, he doesn't\u00a0refer to\u00a0the boy by\u00a0name\u00a0after speaking\u00a0out in New York City.\n*The Magic Man is one of the few live Disney characters to [[Breaking the Fourth Wall|break the fourth wall]].\n\n{{James and the Giant Peach}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Characters who narrate the story]]\n[[Category:James and the Giant Peach characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]"
