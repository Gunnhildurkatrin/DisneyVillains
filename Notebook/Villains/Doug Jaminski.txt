"[[File:Doug_Jaminski.png|thumb]]'''Doug Jaminski''' is a background character of [[Disney XD]]'s series ''[[Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja]]''.\n\n==Biography==\nHe is a student and a member of the Wave Slayers at [[Norrisville High]] School. He is the brother of [[Bash Johnson]].\n\n==Trivia==\n*We learn his name in [[Wave Slayers]] when Heidi announces it on her webcast of the Wave Slayer race.\n*He is shown in the background of numerous episodes, mostly when hanging around Bash Johnson.\n*Strangely enough, in [[The Tale of the Golden Doctor's Note]], he was one of the boys (led by Randy) that helped swing the rope so Howard wouldn't be hit by the balls thrown by Bash and his friends.\n**However, he is one of Bash's friends in other episodes, so this moment and the episode in general is very bizarre in comparison. Bash even called him a \"nerd.\"\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nBrolateralDamage - 243.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Randy Cunningham}}\n[[Category:Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
