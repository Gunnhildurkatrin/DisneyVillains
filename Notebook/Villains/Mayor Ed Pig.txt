He has a daughter named [[Dumpling]]. He is voiced by [[Jim Cummings]].\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[101 Dalmatians: The Series]]''===\nMayor Ed Pig is the mayor of the [[Dearly Farm]], which is due to the fact that nobody else has expressed interest in becoming mayor, so whenever Election Day rolls around, he is usually the only animal on the ballot. However, even though there are trivialities behind how he gets elected each term, Mayor Ed Pig takes his job as seriously and he implements policies and law into effect that he believes will benefit society in one method or another. Unfortunately for the denizens of the Dearly Farm, Mayor Ed Pig is also extremely corrupt and he often uses his position as mayor to fulfill his desires, whether it be through confiscating items that the animals have, or accepting bribes in return for his support; though his corruption has been noticed by a few of the animals on the Dearly Farm. Despite his corrupt nature, Mayor Ed Pig is generally popular, according to the consensus of all the animals on the Dearly Farm, though such is due to the fact that he constantly tries to ensure people\u2019s votes through his actions and his speeches. The only thing that Mayor Ed Pig loves more than his position as mayor is his daughter, Dumpling, whom he spoils at every chance he can get; though who his wife was, or what happened to her, remains a mystery and it is something that is never discussed throughout the course of the series.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\n3597.jpg\nEdPig.jpg\nMayor_Pig_and_Dumpling.jpg|Ed Pig with his daughter\nMcDonald's Disney 101 Dalmatians Flip Car 4.jpg|Ed Pig 1998 McDonald's car set\nSplishingAndSplashing02.jpg\nRollOutThePorkBarrel41.jpg\nRollOutThePorkBarrel06.jpg\nHailToTheChief32.jpg\nEdpig.jpg\nEdpig2.jpg|Ed Pig with Princess\nRobo-Rolly32.jpg\nRobo-Rolly36.jpg|Ed Pig with Cruella\nRollOutThePorkBarrel08.jpg\nRollOutThePorkBarrel11.jpg\nRollOutThePorkBarrel15.jpg|Ed Pig with Rolly\nRollOutThePorkBarrel16.jpg\nRollOutThePorkBarrel17.jpg\nRollOutThePorkBarrel24.jpg\nRollOutThePorkBarrel31.jpg\nRollOutThePorkBarrel32.jpg\nRollOutThePorkBarrel38.jpg\nRollOutThePorkBarrel40.jpg\nEdpig3.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pig, Ed}}\n{{101 Dalmatians}}\n[[Category:Pigs]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Mayors]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:101 Dalmatians characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
