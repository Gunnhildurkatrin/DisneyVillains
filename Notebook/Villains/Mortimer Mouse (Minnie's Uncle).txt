He first appeared in the [[1930]] comic strip storyline ''Mickey Mouse in Death Valley''.\n\nIn his introductory tale, Uncle Mortimer supposedly had died and willed his ranch to his niece, Minnie. [[Sylvester Shyster]] was Mortimer's lawyer and executor of his estate. Shyster had tried to cheat Minnie out of her inheritance, but with the help of Mickey Mouse and a mysterious cloaked figure, Shyster's plot was uncovered. The mysterious stranger turned out to be none other than Mortimer himself, who was testing Shyster in order to confirm his fears about him being a crook.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"200\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nMickeyDeathValley.png|Mortimer welcoming his niece Minnie and her boyfriend Mickey.\n200px-MickeyDeathValley.png|Mortimer in his very first appearance.\nunc'mortimer.jpg|Mortimer in the ''Mickey Mouse'' comic ''Foxed'' (first published in [[1993]]).\n</gallery>\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mouse (Minnie's Uncle), Mortimer}}\n[[Category:Uncles]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Mice]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]"
