Unlike the rest of the [[Manhattan Clan]], Bronx is a [[Gargoyle (creature)|gargoyle]] beast with a dog-like brain, and the inability to speak. Additionally, his lack of wings often results in him having to be carried by another gargoyle or excluded from the nightly activities, though he possesses excellent speed and agility.\n\n==Background==\n===Physical Description===\nAlthough a member of the Manhattan Clan, Bronx is not technically a gargoyle. Rather, he's a gargoyle beast resembling a dog, or at least with a 'doglike' brain. So much so that when [[Puck]] transformed the Manhattan Clan, he turned into a dog while the other Gargoyles turned into humans. Bronx has a deep blue color, fan-shaped ears, two small horns above his brows, and three spikes running along his back. His tail is very short. As mentioned above, Bronx lacks wings and has to be carried (usually by [[Hudson]]) while air traveling.\n\n===Personality===\nUnlike the other gargoyles, Bronx cannot talk, but he is still very intelligent and considered a full-fledged member of the clan. Bronx is a fierce and formidable fighter when there is an emergency, a loyal friend, and a very good judge of character. He is often found sleeping by Hudson's recliner, while Hudson is watching TV. Bronx hates pigeons, with almost savage fury, frequently chasing them away when he wakes at dusk.\n\n===History===\nAt the start of the show Bronx, along with the rest of his clan, lived in Scotland and protected the kingdom of Avalon.\n\nOne night after saving the kingdom. He and [[Brooklyn|three]] [[Lexington|youthful]] [[Broadway|gargoyles]] were unfairly harassed by a paranoid mother in the courtyard, and despite their efforts to appease, they are forced to frighten their harassers to defend themselves. Their leader Goliath subsequently reprimands them for threatening the humans and orders them to remain in their nesting caverns where the clan's eggs are resting.\n\nThis saved him and the other three gargoyles' lives when Vikings came later that day and smashed all the gargoyle statues. When Goliath came back, he informed them what happened and they went after the Vikings.\n\nWhen they arrive, Magus is enraged that the gargoyles' arrival may have caused Katherine's death at Hakon's hands, and so he casts a curse on them which can only be broken when the castle rises above the clouds.\n\nA thousand years later, in 1994, opportunistic billionaire David Xanatos claims the long-abandoned Castle Wyvern and has it reconstructed at the top of his skyscraper in New York City, along with the sleeping gargoyles.\n\nWhen the Gargoyles are naming themselves, the one known as Brooklyn names him Bronx.\n\nBronx accompanies Goliath, Elisa, and Goliath's daughter [[Angela]] on their Avalon world tour.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Bronx is named after one of [[New York City]]'s {{WikipediaLink|The Bronx|five boroughs}}.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nClipbronx.gif|Clip-art of Bronx\nGargoyles.jpg\nGargoyles Bronx.jpg\nBronx2.jpg\nGoliath elisa maza.png\nBronx-gargoyle.jpg\nHudson-bronx.jpg\nGargoyles14.jpg\nBronx-brooklyn.jpg\nGoliath-xanatos-hudson-bronx-lexington-brooklyn.jpg\nBronx23.jpg\nIshimuraClan.jpg\nManhattanClan.jpg\nBronxDog.jpg|Bronx in the form of a dog.\nManhattan Clan (Gargoyles).png\nManhattan Clan (Human) - The Mirror.png\nFile:Gargoyles2x23 1109.jpg\nFile:Shadows of the Past (2).jpg\nFile:Angela .png\nFile:Angela Gargoyles.png\nFile:Angela Gargoyles 5.png\nBronx POP.jpg|Pop figurine of Bronx\nStone Hudson and Bronx POP 2-Pack.jpg|Pop figurines of Bronx and Hudson\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.gargwiki.net/Bronx Bronx] at GargWiki\n{{Gargoyles}}\n{{Disney Emoji Blitz}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bronx}}\n[[Category:Gargoyles characters]]\n[[Category:Gargoyles]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Immortal]]\n[[Category:Superheroes]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Disney Emoji Blitz]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]"
