They are the giant moronic sons of [[Ares]], the God of War.\n\n==Role in the [[Hercules (TV series)|series]]==\nIn \"[[Hercules and the Owl of Athens]]\", to get back at Athena for shaving his dogs of war, Ares orders Fear and Terror to catch Athena's owl Ibid and shave it. Athena places the owl in Hercules' care and he uses it to try and cheat at a history test. Eventually, the two brothers find the owl and Hercules, and take him back to Sparta and use it for playing ''It's All Greek to Me'' and chain up Ares when he gets angry they haven't shaved the bird yet. Hercules and Athena come in, only for Hercules to be sent flying over Sparta and Athena is also chained up. After failing to beat Terror in physical combat, Fear challenges Hercules to ''It's all Greek to Me'' and after Hercules succeeds and frees the gods, the three become study partners.\n\nIn \"[[Hercules and the Aetolian Amphora]]\", Fear and Terror try to buy a stolen Amphora of Lethe Water to make Ares forget that he grounded them from going to an Orpheus concert in Sparta for feeding his dogs of War with scraps and fattening them but came into conflict with [[Hercules (character)|Hercules]] and [[Megara]] over it. Eventually when tracking them to the entrance to the Underworld and the Amphora spills on Hercules and Meg, [[Pain and Panic]] offer to refill the amphora for Fear and Terror after hearing how much the two paid for it.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nHercules and the Aetolian Amphora (68).png\nHercules and the Aetolian Amphora (54).png\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*In actual Greek mythology, Fear and Terror's real names are Phobos, God of Fear, and Deimos, God of Terror.\n*The two are portrayed as demigods, implying their mother is mortal, although she is never seen.\n**In greek mythology, their mother is Aphrodite, goddess of love and beauty. This is obviously not the case in the Disney version.\n*Fear and Terror possess immense strength similar to Hercules, although they are also much larger than him, matching their father in comparable height.\n*The two are often collectively referred to as \"Ares' two mighty sons\", often used as an exclamation.\n*Despite their strength and demigod status, Fear and Terror are very dim-witted, although their intelligence was temporarily boosted by Athena's owl. In their second appearance however, Fear appears somewhat more intelligent.\n*<nowiki>Phobos [Fear] is the root of the word ''-phobia''.</nowiki>\n\n{{Hercules}}\n[[Category:Greek Mythology]]\n[[Category:Greek characters]]\n[[Category:Olympian Gods]]\n[[Category:Demigods and Demigoddesses]]\n[[Category:Immortal]]\n[[Category:Hercules characters]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
