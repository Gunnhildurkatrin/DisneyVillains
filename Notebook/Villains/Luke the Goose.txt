"[[File:Knipsel-0.jpg|thumb|280x280px|Luke talking about the Duck family tree in a Dutch interactive cartoon.]]\n'''Luke the Goose''' is the father of [[Gus Goose]] an uncle of [[Donald Duck]].\n\nHe was created by [[Carl Barks]], in a text-only Donald Duck family tree he sketched for personal use in the 1950s. Here, Barks intended him to be [[Gladstone Gander]]'s father, [[Daphne Duck]]'s husband, [[Grandma Duck]]'s son-in-law and Gus Goose's uncle.\n\nLuke made his first appearance on Mark Worden's illustrated version of the aforementioned tree (first printed in [[1981]]). His appearance was based on that of a background character in Barks' ''Donald Duck'' comic ''Jet Witch'' (first printed in [[1961]]).<ref>http://goofy313g.free.fr/calisota_online/trees/ducktrees/worden.html</ref>\n\nWhen Barks was asked to sketch out a Duck family tree again in the 1990s, making Goosetave Gander (who was originally Gladstone's adoptive father after Gladstone was orphaned when Luke and Daphne \"overate at a free-lunch picnic\") Gladstone's biological father and Daphne's husband. When [[Don Rosa]] created a ''Duck Family Tree'' (first printed in [[1993]]), he used Luke again (removing the \"the\" in his name), and featured him as Gus Goose's father and the husband of Donald's [[Fanny Coot|Aunt Fanny]].\n\nOn the Dutch interactive version of the Duck family tree, Luke was said to be a genealogist, and the creator of the Duck family tree.\n\nLuke and Aunt Fanny made a brief cameo appearance in the streets of [[Duckburg]] in ''[[Dangerous Currency]] ''([[2011]]).\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nGladstoneparentsII.jpg|Luke the Goose and Daphne Duck on Mark Worden's illustrated version of Carl Barks' 1950s Duck family tree.\nWorden2.jpg|Panel from ''Jet Witch'' (1961).\n720299-luke goose1.jpg|Gus Goose's father on the Donald Duck family tree printed in 1993.\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[Category:Geese]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Carl Barks]]\n[[Category:Duck Family]]\n[[Category:Uncles]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
