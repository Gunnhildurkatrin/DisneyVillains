He fought in the Second World War as a member of the famous Tuskegee Airmen. His job was to make sure the tires on the planes were in good working order, replacing or repairing them as need be. One reason for the rivalry between [[Suga Mama]] and Gertie Dinkins since both seemed to have a crush on him back in World War II.\n\nDuring the war, Suga Mama and Gertie were once best friends who used to dance together as partners against the Darnelle sisters in a dance contest held by Chick Robinson at the nightclub as entertainers for the soldiers. It was around that point when the Tuskegee Airmen walked in where Suga Mama and Percy Proud first met. It was love at first sight until Gertie tried to flirt with Percy. Despite the rivalry, Percy decided to dance with both girls as their partner against the Darnelle sisters and their own partner, Rubber-Lace Louie in the contest.\n\nAfter Percy and the girls won the contest, the only thing left to do was for the girls to decide which one was going to leave with Percy. In the end, Suga Mama won through a coin-flip (later revealed by Gertie that Suga Mama cheated using a two-headed coin when she came back to get her purse and found it on the floor) and Percy and Suga Mama finally got married. Thus, began a 50 year grudge and the reason why Gertie, now one of Penny Proud's (Percy and Suga Mama's granddaughter) school teachers, decided to fail [[Penny Proud|Penny]] on her homework including her latest essay on her hero, [[Wikipedia:Hilary Clinton|Hilary Clinton]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nPercy.png\nPercydinkins.png\nPercydinkinsmama.png\nPercydance.png\nPercywin.png\nVlcsnap-2013-09-10-11h02m14s25.png\nVlcsnap-2013-09-10-11h43m04s133.png\nPercymarry.png\nPercycolor.png\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Percy Proud bears a striking resemblance to his younger son, Oscar Proud.\n*He likely had a better relationship with Oscar than Sugar, given Oscar has no negative memories of his father; except for one's where he's included with Sugar and Bobby.\n*It's never revealed when he died, but it was likely some years after Penny was born; since she is familiar enough about him to imply they met.\n*What Percy died from is unknown, but it's possible it was an accident or even getting poisoned by being a willing taste tester for Oscar's early snack recipes; though the former is not likely as the family would have stopped Oscar from continuing if that was the case.\n{{The Proud Family}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Proud Family characters]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Grandparents]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Uncles]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
