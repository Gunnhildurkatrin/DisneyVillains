She is the daughter of one of [[King Triton's Daughters|Ariel's sisters]] and the niece of [[Ariel]].\n\n== Background ==\n=== Personality ===\nArabella is a fashion maven who idolizes [[Evie]] and her style. She's very outgoing and loves the color lavender.\n\n=== Physical Appearance ===\nArabella copies the outfits Evie wears, but in variants of purple and even has a V-braid hairstyle similar to the one Evie wore in the first ''[[disney:Descendants|Descendants]]'' film. She also wears a poison-heart necklace similar to the one Evie owns.\n\n== Printed Media ==\n\n=== [[Rise of the Isle of the Lost: A Descendants Novel]] ===\nShe invited [[Ben (Descendants)|Ben]], [[Mal]], [[Evie]], [[Jay (Descendants)|Jay]], and [[Carlos De Vil|Carlos]] to attend the annual Seaside Festival, a daylong celebration held among the Merfolks. She was at her grandfather's party when the storm appeared in Auradon.\n\n== Trivia ==\n*It is unknown which of Ariel's sisters is the mother of Arabella.\n**She seems to be fond of the color lavender, a color that both [[King Triton's Daughters|Alana and Andrina]] shared. One of them could possibly be Arabella's mother.\n*Many people believe Arabella is the replacement for [[Melody]] since Disney sequels and spin-offs are not canon in the [[Descendants|''Descendants'']] universe.\n*In the web series [[School of Secrets|''School of Secrets'']], a girl wearing a blue dress speaks about her aunt Ariel.\n*She's said to be a student at [[Auradon Prep]] and that it's her first year.\n*Near the end of the ''[[Rise of the Isle of the Lost: A Descendants Novel|Rise of the Isle of the Lost]]'', Evie designed her a dress for the Cotillion.\n\n{{Descendants}}\n[[Category:Descendants characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Nieces]]\n[[Category:Mermaids]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]\n[[Category:Hybrids]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Character stubs]]\n[[Category:Descendants]]\n[[Category:Articles that need a picture]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
