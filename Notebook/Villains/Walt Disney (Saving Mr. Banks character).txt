He is a fictionalised vesion of real-life founder, [[Walt Disney]].\n\n==Background==\nIn 1961, Disney is the president of Walt Disney Productions, and has spent two decades struggling to acquire the film rights to the 1934 novel, ''Mary Poppins'', from its author, [[P. L. Travers (character)|P. L. Travers]].\n\nThough his studio lacks the film rights, he puts the film in pre-production, with co-writer [[Don DaGradi]] and songwriters [[Robert B. Sherman|Robert B.]] and [[Richard Sherman|Richard M. Sherman]] heading the creative team.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the film, Disney is portrayed by\u00a0[[Tom Hanks]]\n*Though based on the real Disney, several elements of the film's depiction of his relationship with Travers are dramatized and fictionalized. In reality, Disney was vacationing in Palm Springs for much of Travers' visit and was not present for much of the scenes he is depicted in.\n* Much of the dialogue between Travers and Disney in the film occurred by way of letters and telephone correspondence between the two.\n* Notably, Disney already had the film rights to\u00a0''Mary Poppins''\u00a0before Travers even arrived at the studio in Burbank to consult with the production team.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Disney, Walt}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Walt Disney}}\n[[Category:Saving Mr. Banks characters]]\n[[Category:Characters based on real people]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Historical characters]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Keepers characters]]"
