Thrust into high-society, she finds herself surrounded by much larger, more luxurious cars but eventually makes do. She is pampered, but time takes its toll on her, mechanically and cosmetically; eventually, her owner trades her in. A second man buys her but her new life is much less pampered, being left outside in the cold and being poorly maintained. One night, she is stolen, chased by the police and totaled in the resulting wreck. Rotting in a junkyard, all looks hopeless for Susie when a young man notices her, buys her, and with the help of his friends, completely restores and revives her into a brand new hotrod.\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\nSusie made a cameo appearance in an episode of the ''[[House of Mouse]]'' called, \"[[Max's New Car]]\". She's seen out in the parking lot parked between a pair of [[Light Cycles]] from ''[[Tron|TRON]]'', and [[Herbie]]. She is also restored to how she looked throughout the short rather tan as a hotrod at the end.\n\n== Trivia ==\n*[[File:1941-1942-willys-americar-1.jpg|thumb|201x201px|Susie's possible basis.]]Susie strongly resembles a 1941\u00a0Willys Americar\u00a0Coupe.\n*Susie's design would be the inspiration for the ''[[Cars (franchise)|Cars]]'' franchise.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\n53105.jpg\n53106.jpg\n53107.jpg\n53108.jpg\n53109.jpg\n53110.jpg\n53111.jpg\n53113.jpg\n53114.jpg\nSusie 4.jpg\nSusie 3.jpg\nSusie 2.jpg\nMax aparcacoches.png|Susie the Little Blue Coupe's cameo in the ''[[House of Mouse]]'' episode \"[[Max's New Car]]\".\nImg4B11.jpg\nCartoons r fun volume 7.JPG\nCartoons r fun volume 7 back.JPG\nCartoons r fun 2 dvd set.JPG\nTumblr mhezzrx7op1s29f4ko3 1280.jpg\nDonald duck fun time kid video.JPG\nSuzie300.jpg\nSusielot350.jpg\nSeptember30th.png|Susie's page in [[Disneystrology]].\nSusie the hotrod.jpg|Restores and revives to a brand new hotrod\n</gallery>\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Coupe, Susie the Little Blue}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Transportation]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Vehicles]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Silly Symphonies characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]"
