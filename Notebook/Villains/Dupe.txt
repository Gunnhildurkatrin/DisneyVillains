'''Experiment 344''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]]. He is designed to generate multiple clones of anyone or anything, creating\u00a0an infinite number of copies. However, his programming is considered a failure because the power of the original is distributed evenly among the duplicates. Luckily, it is possible for him to reverse the cloning. His one true place is making half-calorie [[Shave Ice]] cones with [[Slushy]].\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nDupe is shown to be fun-loving, childish, and immature, due to the fact that he was programmed to be one of the younger experiments (along with [[Mr. Stenchy]] and [[Babyfier]]).\u00a0Because of this, he is often treated as the baby of the heroes' side, as his cloning powers are neither chaotic nor destructive. He is also playful, friendly, and optimistic.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nDupe is a small, golden-yellow experiment resembling a cross between a monkey, lemur, and raccoon. He has relatively flat ears, a brown round nose, black eyes, a white body, a brown-striped, raccoon-like tail, and brown-striped prehensile appendage protruding from his head.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nThe ray from Dupe's appendage can cause any individual or object hit to split into a varying number of duplicates. However, any traits (such as strength, power, calories, etc.) would be divided between the clones, making the original very weak, and resulting in the original and clones having less of everything.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment 344 was the 344th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to clone single individuals into entire armies and make infinite weapons, but\u00a0all of the original's traits were divided between them and the clones.\u00a0344 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.\n\nAt an unknown point after this, Experiment 344 was activated.\n\nAn estimated 12 hours after his activation, 344 was captured by [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Stitch]] and taken back to the [[Lilo's House|house]], but not before being pursued by a relentless [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]].\n\nAfter [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] explained about 344's powers, the latter demonstrated\u00a0by duplicating a lollipop and birthday cake. Stitch then attempted to use 344 to clone [[Pleakley]] as well, despite the latter's\u00a0protests. Fortunately, Jumba put\u00a0344 away on [[Jumba's Ship|his ship]] to prevent any further chaos.\n\nThe following night, after [[Mertle Edmonds|Mertle]] and [[Elena, Teresa, and Yuki|the hula girls]]\u00a0did not attend Lilo's slumber party that she hosted earlier, Lilo used 344, christened Dupe, to generate clones of herself that she could befriend. However, Stitch hastily intervened, resulting in him being cloned into three instead.\n\nLater that night, Gantu, [[Hammerface|033]], [[Heat|609]], [[Thresher|544]], and [[Plasmoid|617]] attacked the Pelekai residence. The Stitch clones tried to fight back, but due to a side effect from Dupe's replication, they had all become very weak, thus enabling Gantu and his henchmen experiments to easily defeat and capture all four Stitches in containment orbs.\n\nShortly after Stitch was kidnapped, Lilo hatched a plan and used Dupe to generate three clones of Pleakley, leaving the original comatose. Lilo and the Pleakley clones then launched a rescue mission on\u00a0[[Gantu's Ship|Gantu's ship]]\u00a0while taking Dupe with them so he could re-merge the Stitch clones.\n\nWhen Gantu noticed them and Lilo notified him of Dupe's cloning powers, Gantu grabbed Dupe and cloned Hammerface, Heat, Thresher, and Plasmoid each into a hundred replicas. However, as a result of being tricked by Lilo, the experiments had all become complete weaklings, and thus were easily defeated by Lilo and the Pleakleys.\n\nLilo then used Dupe to re-merge the freed Stitch clones into the original, and Lilo, Stitch, Dupe, and the Pleakley clones escaped the ship. Dupe then re-merged the Pleakley clones\u00a0into the original, and he was later found a one true place-making half-calorie [[Shave Ice]].\n\nIn \"[[Remmy (episode)|Remmy]]\",\u00a0Dupe was one of the experiments in Lilo's dream.\n\nIn \"[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]\", [[Slushy]] and Dupe were seen using their combined powers to sell multiple low-calorie Shave Ice cones that [[Charles and Mary|a couple]] bought and enjoyed. Gantu then attempted to revert the rehabilitated experiments\u00a0to evil by playing a recording of [[Angel]]'s song, but due to interference from [[Snafu|Experiment 120]], Gantu's karaoke tape was played instead, much to Slushy and Dupe's humor.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nThe first 624 experiments, including Dupe, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]], and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nDupe participated in the following battle between the experiments and the\u00a0[[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]] by splitting attacking Leroys into weakling Leroys.\n\nHowever, the Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.\n\n===''[[Stitch!]]''===\nDupe made an appearance in the ''Stitch!'' anime where his tweak was altered by [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]], so instead of making things weaker once duplicated, the duplicates are made stronger (and bigger) than the original.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*According to Jumba, Dupe \"is [a] duplicator. It can make multiple copies of anyone or anything. Designed to make infinite number of weapons.\" However, Dupe \"was [a] failure. Duplicates were not as powerful as [the] original.\"\n*Dupe was activated off-screen.\n*Dupe's antenna and ears appear in the online game ''[[Jumba's Lab (Game)|Jumba's Lab]]''.\n*Dupe also appears in the online game ''[[Lilo & Stitch: Alien Interception]]'' along with [[Plasmoid]], [[Tank (Lilo & Stitch)|Tank]], [[Clyde (Lilo & Stitch)|Clyde]], [[Yang]], and [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]].\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
