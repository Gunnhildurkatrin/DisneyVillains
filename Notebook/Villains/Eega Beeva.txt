A time traveler from several centuries into the future, he was intended to be a highly evolved human, though other stories have called him an alien. Though relatively obscure in American comic stories, he is very popular in the Italian Disney comics, even receiving his own solo adventures.\n==History==\nHis comic debut was in the story \u201cThe Man of Tomorrow\u201d on September 26, 1947. His first encounter with Mickey took place in a dark cave. After taking him home, Eega grew to understand the 20th century human world as time went on (except for the currency of money). Two scientists examined the creature and were surprised about him representing a human being 500 years from today. He is also shown to be heroic when he saved Goofy from falling off a cliff near the end of the serial on December 27, 1947.\n\nFor the next three years, Eega\u2019s antics took the spotlight away from his friend, Mickey Mouse (who is delegated to a side character). His final appearance in the strip was on July 11, 1950 at the beginning of the serialized arc, \u201cMousepotamia\u201d. With the serialized stories of the Mickey Mouse comic strip dissolved in mid-1955, Romano Scarpa in Italy revived the character for Italian comics overseas. His first appearance in a serialized story since 1950 in America was, \u201cThe Blot\u2019s Double Mystery\u201d.\n\n41 years later in 1988, Eega returned in American comic books after his strip debut. He was once again an important cast member of the Mickey Mouse comics. He also appeared in Disney\u2019s Ultraheroes as one of the main characters and the leader of the group. His speech pattern of \u201cP\u201d at the beginning of a few words are shown to be absent in the series.\n\n==Trivia==\n*He is (as of 2020) one of the few\u00a0Disney comic book characters that never made an animated appearance.\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nEega Beeva.jpg\nHr (9).jpg|Eega Beeva, the [[Phantom Blot]]'s accomplice?\nSuperheroesvssupervillains.jpg\nEega Beeva Ultraheroes.JPG|Eega Beeva in Ultraheroes.\nSuperheroesreunite .jpg\n5135812-eegabeeva(disney).png\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Beeva, Eega}}\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Superheroes]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Time travelers]]"
