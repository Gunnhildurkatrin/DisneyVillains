He is a kind, happy squirrel who enjoys eating nuts and has a good sense of friendship, good enough to make him hate arrogant people like [[Kuzco]] and act cross with them. He is also a great friend of [[Kronk]]'s and is a tutor on Squirrel Speak in Kuzco Academy.\n\n==Personality==\nEven though Bucky is more than capable of antagonizing people he dislikes, he is a very nice and talkative, as long as the listener masters squirrel speak. Being a squirrel speak tutor, he gives his tutored students efficient methods to master the language, and is sweet enough to make even his enemies like him. However, Bucky can be very annoying to people who simply dislike his type.\n\nHe is kind and giving, as seen when he first met Kuzco and gave him an acorn. But when his kindness is spurned (as seen when Kuzco furiously threw the acorn onto Bucky's head and angrily told him to hit the road) he can be the little stinker (although he was antagonized by Kuzco first), as he mockingly threatened to wake some jaguars Kuzco had stumbled upon by popping a balloon.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]''===\nBucky is first seen when llama Kuzco is lost in the jungle. Bucky arrives and amiably offers him an acorn. Kuzco takes the acorn in mock pleasantry but then hit Bucky on the head with it and tells him to get lost. Right after, Kuzco falls into an area filled with sleeping [[Jaguars (The Emperor's New Groove)|jaguars]]. Bucky blows up a balloon animal and threatens to pop it. He does so, but it fails to wake up the jaguars until Kuzco screams \"Ha!\" Later on during [[Yzma]] and Kronk's search for Kuzco, Kronk uses his squirrel talk to ask Bucky if he's seen Kuzco.\n\n===''[[Kronk's New Groove]]''===\nBucky reappears as Kronk's \"sidekick\" of sorts. He is also a part of Kronk's Squirrel Scouts organization.\n\n===''[[The Emperor's New School]]''===\nBucky is a recurring character in the series. He is often seen in cameos roles but there are a few episodes that show his significance: in one episode [[Squeakend at Bucky's]], Bucky was assigned to tutor Kuzco in his squirrel speak class. In another, Kuzco is transformed into a squirrel via Yzma's potions and with Bucky's assistance, he manages to break the curse.\n\n== Trivia ==\n\n* As Kuzco christened him with the name out of disgust, and as an insult to his bucktooth, it is likely that 'Bucky' is not his real name (which is otherwise unknown)\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n{{The Emperor's New Groove}}\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Emperor's New Groove characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Squirrels]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Peruvian characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Sorcerer's Arena Characters]]"
