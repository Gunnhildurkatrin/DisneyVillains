But becoming a witch is my chance to be someone.|Luz commenting on her desire to become a witch|The Intruder}}\n'''Luz Noceda''' is the main protagonist of the animated series ''[[The Owl House]]''. She is a human girl who finds herself transported to another world and learns to be a witch under the tutelage of [[Eda Clawthorne]].\n\n==Background==\nLuz is a self-assured 14-year-old human girl from Connecticut, who accidentally stumbles upon a portal that transports her to [[the Boiling Isles]].\n\nUpon arrival, Luz decides to make her dream of becoming a witch come a reality, after she befriends a witch named Eda and becomes her apprentice. This proves to be difficult due to Luz's lack of magical abilities as well as the local town's demons being very prejudiced towards humans which forces her to hide her real identity.\n\n===Personality===\nLuz is a very excitable young girl. With a high fascination for all things fantasy and a knack for adventure, Luz is very outgoing and willing to hop into anything thrown her way. She sometimes has trouble looking before she leaps, but always manages to somehow land on her feet. In \"[[A Lying Witch and a Warden]]\", Luz describes herself as someone who enjoys \"editing anime clips to music and reading fantasy books with convoluted backstories\" while in \"[[The First Day]]\", her aura is described as \"strong and silly like a baby's laughter\".\n\n===Physical appearance===\nLuz is a Dominican-American fourteen-year-old girl with tan skin, short, dark brown hair, and hazel-brown eyes. Her clothing consists of a pair of black earrings, a white-and-violet hoodie with cat ears attached to the hood, jean-shorts, dark gray leggings, and a pair of white slip-on shoes. Her nightwear consists of a light gray sleeveless top, purple shorts with an amber moon and star, and white-and-indigo socks. When attending [[Hexside School of Magic and Demonics]], she wears the standard uniform but with multi-colored sleeves and leggings as she is studying all the tracks in the school.\n\nBetween the pilot and the actual series, Luz initially wore an indigo and white striped t-shirt and black capri pants.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\n*'''Magic:''' Since Luz lacks any natural magical abilities and has no magic sac attached to her heart, she had to learn magic a different way. In \"[[The Intruder]]\", she learns that when casting the [[Spell Circle]] there is a glyph pattern that needs to be included, which can be seen for a brief moment. By drawing a specific glyph within the circle and giving it a tap, she can cast spells. She cannot use the magic in the human world. After Eda and Lilith discovered that combining glyphs can cast new spells, Luz started experimenting with different combos, expanding her magic.\n**'''Light spell:''' Creates an illuminating orb of light and is the first spell Luz learns. To cast this spell, she needs to draw a large triangle in the spell circle with a smaller triangle and circle on top. Down the middle a long line with two smaller lines across, side by side in the triangle.\n**'''Ice spell:''' Conjures ice. To cast this spell, Luz needs to draw a diamond with a line down the center, sat on another line across the bottom of the spell circle. A curved line must be drawn across the diamond and sometimes a smaller diamond is included at the bottom.\n**'''Plant spell:''' At some point in \"[[Enchanting Grom Fright]]\", Luz learns how to create plants. To cast this spell, Luz must draw a plant like glyph.\n**'''Fire spell:''' Conjures fire by drawing a larger circle at the bottom of the spell circle with a dot in the center. On top, Luz must draw a smaller circle with a curved triangle on top. Another curved triangle is also included on top of the bigger circle which goes over the smaller circle. Luz first learnt this spell during a Grudgby match against [[Boscha]].\n**'''Invisibility:''' Inspired from Lilith's history books, Luz came up with a glyph combination that turns her invisible. However, this spell only lasts as long as she can hold her breath.\n**'''Mist/Sleeping spell:''' By combining the fire and ice, Luz can conjure up a mist. Also by including pollen from sleeping nettle flowers within the combination, she can create sleep-induced smoke.\n\n==Role in the [[The Owl House|series]]==\n===Season One===\nLuz Noceda begins the series at home, displaying her \"weird\" behavior at school when her presentation ends in disaster. At the insistence of her school principal and the support of her mother [[Camila Noceda|Camila]], Luz must attend \"Reality Check Summer Camp\" where she is to \"think inside the box\" for her own sake. Luz seemingly complies when her mother points out that she does not have any friends and responds by throwing away her copy of ''The Good Witch Azura'' into the trash bin, but when her mother leaves for work, Luz goes looking for it and finds a small owl carrying a bag of garbage with her book among the items in it. Luz chases it into a rickety house and suddenly finds herself transported to another world called the Boiling Isles, specifically into a town called Bonesborough. Luz immediately runs into [[Eda Clawthorne]], otherwise known as the Owl Lady, who claims to be \"the most powerful witch on the Boiling Isles\". However, she is also the most infamous and is constantly evading the law. Luz gets taken under her wing and is taken to her home, the Owl House, where she also meets the diminutive [[King (The Owl House)|King]] and the obnoxiously surreal [[Hooty]]. Empathizing with the fact that they consider themselves \"weirdos\", as well as realizing how unfulfilling her life at summer camp will be, Luz asks to stay so that she can learn to be a witch.\n\n[[File:The Owl House 20.png|thumb|left|250px|Luz learns her first spell.]]\nFrom the get go, Luz is hit with two harsh realities about the Boiling Isles: she is not that special and she is incapable of performing magic on her own as she lacks \"a sac of magic bile attached to [her] heart\". She quickly discovers that there exists a school called [[Hexside School of Magic and Demonics]] and even manages to befriend two students there; an abominations student, later plant student, named [[Willow Park]], and an illusion student named [[Gus Porter]]. She also runs afoul of the top tier snob [[Amity Blight]]. Unfortunately, Luz gets banned from attending after accidentally causing a raucous, which pleases Eda as she dislikes the school. Luz also discovers that Eda had been cursed when she was young, resulting in her transforming into a giant owl beast unless she takes an elixir daily. While trying to quell Eda in her beast form, Luz finds out that she can draw symbols that create magic, allowing her to learn the craft efficiently. This revelation, combined with learning about her personal issues, softens the animosity between her and Amity. Luz also dedicates herself to trying to find a way to cure Eda of her curse once she learns that the elixir is slowly starting to lose its effect on Eda. She also meets her sister [[Lilith Clawthorne]], a member of the Emperor's Coven who has been trying to capture Eda, and becomes curious about Eda's background.\n\nLuz's relationship with Willow and Amity becomes more complex when she learns that they used to be good friends. This results in Luz trying to reach out to Amity. After a rough adventure with her, Luz and Amity come to an understanding and become warmer, as well as bond over their shared love of ''The Good Witch Azura'' books. Later, they team up to help Willow restore her memories after Amity nearly destroys them. Through the actions of Gus and a slightly repentant Eda, Luz ends up getting accepted into Hexside, but is dismayed to learn that she can only learn from one track. After saving the school from a Greater Basilisk and teaming up with the students of the detention track, for merely trying to learn more than one type of magic, Luz manages to convince [[Principal Bump]] to have her take every track, much to her enjoyment. She is humored at the fact that Eda also wanted to learn from all the tracks when she was attending. Luz and her friends become closer now that she begins to attend Hexside to the point that Amity slowly begins to gain a crush on her, something Luz is completely oblivious to. She even begins to challenge the new mean girl [[Boscha]] when she refuses to let up on picking on Willow, who had begun to display newfound confidence.\n\n[[File:Young Blood, Old Souls (73).png|thumb|250px|Luz rescuing Eda, Lilith and King.]]\nThings come to a head when Luz decides to cure Eda from her curse once and for all. She attends a field trip to the Emperor's Coven and begins searching for the Healing Hat, an old relic that supposedly can cure anything. With the help of Willow and Gus, she locates the item, but is caught by Lilith who destroys it and uses Luz as bait to lure Eda. During the fight, Lilith reveals that she was the one who cursed Eda and she gives into her curse. Luz is forced to return to the Owl House. With King's help, Luz resolves to rescue Eda and defeat Lilith. To her surprise, Lilith has had a change of heart when she reveals that [[Emperor Belos]] plans to kill Eda rather than cure her, as she had initially hoped. Luz takes on Belos herself and destroys the [[Portal (The Owl House)|portal]] that was used to bring her to the Boiling Isles, thus destroying her \"true way\" home. Luz rescues Eda, along with King and Lilith and they return home to the Owl House. Lilith uses her magic to share the curse between herself and Eda, resulting in both of their magic diminishing. Luz, having mastered her take on magic, now takes it upon herself to help the sisters relearn their abilities. Despite having lost her way back home and having her mentor lose her powers, Luz is confidant that things will work out for her.\n\n==Relationships==\n{{Relationshipslink}}\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Luz is of Hispanic descent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/DisneyTVANews/status/1180160362123075584|title=DTVA News Post|date=October 4, 2019}}</ref>\n*Her name means \"light\" in Spanish and Portuguese.\n**It is also pronounced as \"/lu\u02d0z/ ''LOOZ''\".\n**\"Noceda\" sounds like \"no ceda (pronounced /\u02c8n\u0259\u028as\u025b\u026ad\u0259/ ''NOH-say-d\u0259'')\" or \"no cede (pronounced /\u02c8n\u0259\u028ase\u026ad\u025b/ ''NOH-say-deh'')\", which is Spanish for \"doesn't give in\", which describes her feisty, determined spirit.\n**Together her name could simplistically mean \"a light that does not go out\".\n*Luz is named after [[Dana Terrace]]'s friend, Luz Batista, who works as a story artist and consultant for the show.\n*In \"[[A Lying Witch and a Warden]]\", Luz states that she likes to edit anime clips to music.
