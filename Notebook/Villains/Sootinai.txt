When all of the spirits merged into one, they became Sootinai. Sootinai can absorb the smoke from fires, making him himself larger and more powerful. His name derives from the phrase \"Soot in Eye\".\n\nHe was originally summoned by [[Abis Mal]]. After his defeat, [[Haroud Hazi Bin|Haroud]] brought the wet ashes which remained back to his master, who hoped to sell them for quick cash. Sootinai emerged from the sopping mess and scared the two away. It is then revealed to be [[Genie]] playing a prank.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Sootinai is graphically very similar to [[Chernabog]], but Sootinai does not possess wings.\n*Sootinai also bears a physical similarity to Hexxus from the 1992 animated film ''FernGully: The Last Rainforest.''\n*His name is a pun on the phrase \"soot in the eye\". \n{{Aladdin}}\n[[Category:Aladdin characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Those destroyed]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Lords]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Demons]]"
