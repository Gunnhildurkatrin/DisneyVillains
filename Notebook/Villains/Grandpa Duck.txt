The narrator compares Donald's comfortable and plentiful lifestyle with that of Donald's grandfather, who did not have it that easy, and still had to hunt in order to have food on the table. When he hears about the upcoming opening of the hunting season, Grandpa Duck's spirit emerges from the portrait, and insists that Donald take part, and accompanies him on the hunt.\n\nHe reappeared in the ''[[Walt Disney anthology series|Disneyland]]'' episode \"[[Your Host, Donald Duck]]\", when Donald tells the audience the story of how his grandparents came west in a covered wagon.\n\nHe is generally considered to be [[Grandma Duck]]'s husband, given his name and relation to Donald.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nNo hunting 14large.jpg\nNo hunting 12large.jpg\nNo hunting 6large.jpg\nNo hunting 7large.jpg\nNo hunting 5large.jpg\n1955-chasse-05.jpg\n1955-chasse-02.jpg\nGrampa and donald.JPG\nGrampa and donald 2.PNG\n1957-your-host-donald-duck-09.jpg|Grandpa Duck in \"Your Host, Donald Duck\".\ntreepinset.jpg\nDuck family Carpi.jpg|Grandpa Duck on the Duck family tree.\ngrandma2.gif\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*When Grandpa Duck reappeared in the Duck family tree drawn by Giovan Battista Carpi (first printed in [[1994]]), he and Grandma Duck's husband (as he appeared in ''The Good Old Daze'' from [[1964]]) were shown on different portraits. Grandma Duck's husband was here called \"Donald's grandpa\", while Grandpa Duck from the 1955 cartoon was called \"Donald's great-grandpa\", implying that he is in fact a generation older than Grandma's husband. This information is, however, not given in the original cartoon in which Grandpa appeared.\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Hunters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Grandparents]]\n[[Category:Duck Family]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Spirits]]\n[[Category:Presumably Deceased characters]]"
