Faline tells Ena that Bambi is bashful, to which Ena replies that he may not be if Faline says hello to him. Bambi later chases Faline around Ena and his mother before they run further into the meadow together whilst being looked on by their mothers.\n\nEna, Faline, Bambi, Bambi's mother, and with the other deer leave the meadow after being alerted of [[Man]]'s arrival by Bambi's father, [[The Great Prince of the Forest]].\n\n==''[[Bambi II]]''==\nEna briefly appears to take Faline home after she, Bambi, [[Thumper]], [[Flower]], and some of the other forest animals visit the Groundhog to see if winter will end.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the original novel on which the film is based on, Ena is actually Bambi's maternal aunt.\n*In the book, she's the mate of an unknown buck, and also the mother of Faline's twin brother, Gobo, who would later fall in love and become mates with a young doe named Marena, who, as a result, becomes her daughter-in-law.\n*In the book's sequel ''[[Bambi's Children]]'', she gains two adoptive grandchildren when Faline adopts the two orphaned bucks, Mambo and Nello.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nImagebambifae.jpg|Ena and her daughter Faline.\nImagebambibmaewtcp.jpg|Ena and Bambi's mother watch their children play.\nImagebambieafftm.jpg|Ena and Faline flee the meadow to escape Man.\nImagebiiae.jpg|Ena in ''Bambi II''.\n</gallery>\n\n{{Bambi}}\n\n[[fr:Tante Ena]]\n[[nl:Ena]]\n[[pl:Ena]]\n[[pt-br:Tia Ena]]\n[[ru:\u0418\u043d\u0430]]\n[[Category:Bambi characters]]\n[[Category:Deer]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Aunts]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Grandparents]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]"
