'''Experiment 025''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]]\u00a0and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]]. He\u00a0is designed to give off a radiantly bright light with which to pose as an invasion-signaling beacon to the [[Galactic Armada]]. His one true place is as a Christmas star.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment 025 was the 25th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel's]] funding. He was designed to use his bright light to pose as a beacon for an invasion to the [[Galactic Armada]]. 025 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\n025's pod was found by [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] on Christmas Eve, which he planned on having giftwrapped and sent out to [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]] as a Christmas present after [[Reuben|Experiment 625]] suggested it.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] was attempting to teach [[Stitch]] about Christmas when the latter noticed a woman putting 025's pod in a gift box. Stitch hastily grabbed what he thought was the giftwrapped pod, but when he tried to tell Lilo, she ignored him.\n\nWhen Gantu later dropped\u00a0by to pick up 025's pod, the same woman who had wrapped it earlier hinted that there was a mishap involving Stitch, much to Gantu's anger. He then swore to avenge Stitch for stealing H\u00e4msterviel's gift.\n\nIn an attempt to find the pod, Stitch stole countless presents from every house and the local mall. Lilo assumed Stitch was selfishly hoarding gifts for himself, but after the latter was captured and interrogated, he revealed what he was really trying to do. Shortly after, Gantu attacked the [[Lilo's House|Pelekai residence]]\u00a0and managed to make off with all the presents that Stitch had stolen beforehand.\n\nWhen Lilo, Stitch, [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], and [[Pleakley]] located the experiment pod in [[Kokaua Town|town]], the four tussled with Gantu dressed in a [[Santa Claus|Santa]] outfit. Lilo and Stitch snatched the giftwrapped pod from Gantu, although he retrieved it after a long chase. However, when Gantu attempted to crush Lilo for meddling, she reprimanded him until he admitted that he intended to give 025's pod to H\u00e4msterviel as a Christmas present.\n\nJust then, a little girl asked Gantu for a mere Christmas gift, believing he was actually Santa. Forced to comply, Gantu ended up giving 025's pod to her and later distributed presents to other children, thereby honoring the true spirit of Christmas.\n\nAfter Jumba discovered 025 to be harmless, Lilo activated 025 in a fountain. She then named him Topper, shared him with the little girl seen from before, and gave him a one true place atop the local Christmas tree (actually a decorated Pleakley) as a Christmas star, while Topper's bright light unintentionally signaled the [[Galactic Armada]].\n\nTopper reappeared in \"[[Elastico (episode)|Elastico]]\"\u00a0as one of the audience members for Lilo's hula dance.\n\n===''[[The Origin of Stitch]]''===\nTopper was one of the experiments that was gliding on the screen, but he is 591 instead of 025.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nThe first 624 experiments, including Topper, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]] and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nTopper participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]], but it is unknown what he did. However, it is presumed that he wouldn't have been able to be very effective, due to the fact that his powers are deemed useless.\n\nThe Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.\n\n===''[[Stitch!]]''===\nTopper made a cameo appearance in the ''Stitch!'' anime as one of the experiments in [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s [[Prison Asteroid K-37|prison cell]].\n\n==Trivia==\n*Topper was first revealed in a DVD bonus feature of ''[[Stitch! The Movie]]'' in the experiment gallery.\n*Topper is one of the rare experiments to not have black eyes like most experiments, having blue eyes instead.\n*Topper's primary function is to use his bright light to signal the alien attack fleet. However, on the Disney site, it is incorrectly stated that Topper's light is designed to keep people awake.\n*Even though\u00a0Topper found his one true place atop\u00a0a Christmas tree, it is unknown what he does during the other seasons.\n*Topper's\u00a0[[Experiment Pods|pod]] color is white.\n*His number is a likely reference to Christmas Day ([[December 25]]).\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nTopper (Experiment 025).png\nLilo & Stitch Club BV JP wallpaper.jpg\nvlcsnap-2013-06-02-22h26m10s25.png|Topper's experiment pod\nvlcsnap-2013-07-21-08h02m50s39.png\nvlcsnap-2013-07-21-08h12m20s186.png\nVlcsnap-2013-05-23-17h30m42s37.png\nVlcsnap-2013-05-23-17h29m25s21.png\nvlcsnap-2013-07-21-08h16m03s102.png\nvlcsnap-2013-06-13-22h43m35s209.png|Topper laughing\nvlcsnap-2013-06-13-22h44m05s251.png\nScreenCapture 16.02.13 20-03-29.jpg\nVlcsnap-2013-02-08-11h58m00s88.png\nVlcsnap-2012-07-03-21h12m47s46.png\nVlcsnap-2013-03-30-19h50m30s116.png\nVlcsnap-2013-04-15-07h27m59s93.png\nVlcsnap-2013-07-07-22h53m14s184.png\nVlcsnap-2013-06-13-14h04m04s77.png\nScreenCapture 03.04.13 14-16-57.jpg\nVlcsnap-2012-07-03-22h16m18s43.png\nVlcsnap-2012-08-02-18h36m50s165.png\nThe Origin Of Stitch Topper.jpg|Misidentified as Experiment 591 (Squidly)\nScreenCapture 26.02.13 19-44-43.jpg\nscreenCapture 05.03.13 21-22-39.jpg\nscreenCapture 05.03.13 21-23-46.jpg\npanes08.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
