He is coach of the Tourney Team at [[Auradon Prep]].\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Descendants]]''===\nCoach Jenkins first appears on the field of [[Auradon Prep]] to train the Tourney Team. The new student, [[Jay (Descendants)|Jay]], shows raw talent at the game despite it being his first time playing. Coach Jenkins enjoys his ability but his aggression and lack of teamwork are an issue. He then teaches Jay the values of teamwork, stating that a team made of different members is similar to body parts needing each other to function properly. He then gives Jay a T-shirt with his name ironed on it.\n\nDuring the Tourney Tournament, Jay convinces Jenkins to let his physically weaker friend, [[Carlos De Vil]], to participate. Despite his hesitation, the boys manage to come together and win the tournament.\n\n==Personality==\nCoach Jenkins is shown to have a sense of humor. When he saw Jay's talent, he jokingly told Jay he'd show him a rulebook, something Jay's never seen before. He also saw Jay's ability to mature if he learned to work in a team rather than alone and coached Jay and succeeding in teaching him the value of teamwork.\n\nFitting to his career as a coach, he did not care Jay was from the [[Isle of the Lost]] and only cared that he had the natural-born talent in the tourney. As a result, he personally took Jay under his wing.\n{{Descendants}}\n[[Category:Descendants characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Schoolteachers]]\n[[Category:Coaches]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
