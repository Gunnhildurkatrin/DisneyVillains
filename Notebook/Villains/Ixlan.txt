She is the only living Maruvian and is also known as the Lightning Warrior.\n\n== Role in the\u00a0series ==\nIxlan makes her debut in \"[[The Lightning Warrior]]\". After [[Quita Moz]] tells [[Princess Elena|Elena]] that the flames revealed that Ixlan, his strongest pupil, did not perish with the rest of the Maruvians, but is locked away under a dark magic spell on La Isla de Yalcatura. Quita Moz adds that Ixlan's help will be needed for Elena's struggle ahead. To free Ixlan, Elena needs a Malvago to use dark magic. With the help of Victor and Carla Delgado, Ixlan is freed, and she leaps out of the cave, causing Elena to drop her scepter, which Naomi catches. Upon seeing the scepter, Ixlan reveals that Quita said she might meet a princess one day wielding the Scepter of Light. Naomi laughs and says that the scepter is not hers. Elena arrives and states that she is the princess. However, Ixlan is unimpressed with Elena. Ixlan asks them how they got past the Moyacu which guards the island. Victor spots something in the water and asks Elena for his tamborita. However, Elena refuses to believe him. What Victor saw turns out to be the Moyacu who swallows them whole.\n\nVictor asks Elena to give him and Carla their tamboritas but Elena refuses due to the fact she still doesn't trust them. Victor tries to get them out by making the Moyacu sneeze. However, this only gets Victor blown out through its spout. Carla blames Elena for this disaster. Elena voices her distrust. Naomi reminds Elena that Quita Moz said you never know if you can trust someone until you do trust them. Elena decides to trust them and they get them out. Ixlan is finally impressed with Princess Elena and declares that she is wholeheartedly at her service. \u00a0\n\nBack in Avalor, Quita Moz arrives and gives Ixlan her magic gloves, and she becomes equipped to help Elena defeat Ash. \n\nShe makes her second appearance in \"[[Elena's Day Off]]\" where she, along with Naomi and Isabel, take Elena along on a Girl's Day. Unfortunately for them, Elena quickly proves to be a workaholic who doesn't even know how to relax for even a second. Because of this, she keeps sneaking off to make checks on everyone's coronation preparations. As such, Naomi, Isabel, and Ixlan have to keep dragging her back. Elena even has [[Mingo, Zoom, and Estrella|Mingo]] bring her her scepter so she can use it's Farsight power to check on Do\u00f1a Paloma's work by bribing him with Anoki Berry smores. When she's caught doing this, her good and fed up friends and sister drag her away for a mud bath. Unfortunately, Naomi makes a comment about Do\u00f1a Paloma accidentally offending King Toshi with a showy napkin fold. This makes Elena get so worked up that she takes off back to Avalor Palace.\n\nIxlan, Naomi, and Isabel give chase. Elena's anxiety causes her emotion magic to activate and send everyone spinning. Elena calms down enough to get them down. Elena then continues to head back to the Palace. Along the way, she makes a huge mess. When Elena meets Do\u00f1a Paloma, Paloma reveals Elena had nothing to worry about. Elena apologizes to her sister and friends for not letting them help her and reveals that she wants to get used to dealing with everything herself as she won't have the Grand Council to help her anymore once she's Queen of Avalor. Elena fixes the mess and then gives Do\u00f1a Paloma the day off, to which Ixlan herself drags Do\u00f1a Paloma and away on a carriage, declaring that she wins Girl's Day.\n\nIn \"[[Coronation Day]]\", Ixlan partakes in the battle against Ash and her villainous group, managing to overpower Esteban by countering his teleportation powers with her great speed. However, while Ash casts the spell to free the [[Four Shades of Awesome]], the distraction enables Esteban to slip away. When the Four Shades of Awesome are released, she is overwhelmed by Hetz, the weather shade, and she retreats with her allies as Esteban escapes.\n\nShe later helps defend Avalor city from the Shades, but falls victim to brainwashing by Vuli, the Chaos Shade. After all of the Shades have been defeated, she attends Elena's coronation and is seen dancing with [[Antonia Bello]].\n\n== Trivia ==\n*Ixlan is the only remaining Maruvian, due to having been sealed away instead of sent to the [[Spirit World]].\n*The synopsis for \"The Lightning Warrior\" describes her as a princess, though there has yet to be a single mention or indication that she is one.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nTeam pose.png\nElena's Day Off.png\nElena's high flying bouncy fun.jpg\nElena busted with her scepter.jpg\nElena's pathetic lie.jpg\nIxlan grabs Elena's scepter and threatens her with it.jpg\nIxlan gives Elena a mud bath.jpg\nElena now starting to relax in her mud bath.jpg\nElena's day off.png\nIxlan impressed by Elena destroying the bridge.jpg\nEoA Ixlan takes Paloma on her relaxation now.jpg\nIxlan unimpressed with Ash's group .jpg|Ixlan unimpressed with Ash, Chatana, Esteban, Tziloco and Pili\nIxlan still not impressed .jpg\nIxlan on a jaquin.jpg\nIxlan meets Esteban .jpg|\"You are very fast.\"\nIxlan reaches Esteban.jpg|\"But I am faster.\"\nIxlan vs Esteban .jpg|Ixlan vs Esteban\nIxlan with Esteban's staff.jpg|\"I have never felt such joy.\"\nIxlan unimpressed with lightning.jpg|Ixlan unimpressed with Hetz's lightning\nIxlan running .jpg\nIxlan vs Hetz .jpg|Ixlan vs Hetz\nIxlan gearing up.jpg\nReady to fight Vuli.jpg\nIxlan leaping.jpg\nIxlan vs Vuli .jpg|Ixlan vs Vuli\nIxlan lands a punch.jpg|Ixlan vs Vuli\nLightning punch.jpg\nTouched by Vuli.jpg|Ixlan influenced by Vuli's touch of chaos\nIxlan at Elena's coronation .jpg|Ixlan at Elena's coronation \nIxlan dancing with Antonia .jpg|Ixlan dancing with Antonia Bello\n</gallery>\n\n{{Elena of Avalor}}\n[[pt-br:Ixlan]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Elena of Avalor characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Warriors]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Military characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
