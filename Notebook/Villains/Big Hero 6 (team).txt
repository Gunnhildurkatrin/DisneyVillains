But sometimes life doesn't go the way you planned. The good thing is, my brother wanted to help a lot of people and that's what we're going to do. Who are we?|[[Hiro Hamada]]'s last lines and closing narration}}\n\n'''Big Hero 6''' is a high-tech group of superheroes from the city of [[San Fransokyo]] in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[2014]] [[Big Hero 6|animated feature film of the same name]], as well as the [[Big Hero 6: The Series|subsequent television series]].\n\n==Background==\nOriginally a group of students, the team was formed for the purpose of capturing the supervillain [[Yokai]], the man responsible for the death of their friend (and Hiro's brother) [[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi]], and bringing him to justice. Thanks to the students' high intellect, the group built specialized suits based on the individual skills of each member, transforming themselves into high-tech superheroes.\n\nAfter stopping Yokai's plot to kill [[Alistair Krei]], they enter a hiatus with no intention of reforming their team (except [[Fred (Big Hero 6)|Fred]]). It isn't until a new threat arises in the form of [[Yama (Big Hero 6)|Yama]] that the team reluctantly jumps back into action and unanimously agree to officially establish themselves as resident superheroes and protectors of San Fransokyo. In doing so, they look to honor Tadashi's wish to help a lot of people.\n\nOutside of the core six members, other characters have been irregularly affiliated with the team. Some of these include Fred's butler [[Heathcliff]], who occasionally provides transportation via the Frederickson family chopper and limo. [[Mini-Max]]\u2014essentially a miniature version of Baymax\u2014was created as a guardian for Fred, and was given his own super armor to aid the team when necessary. [[Richardson Mole]] briefly joined the team after discovering their identities, but he was dropped after his memory was accidentally wiped.\n\nOver time, the team would see occasional upgrades provided by Hiro to enhance their performance. In \"[[Mr. Sparkles Loses His Sparkle]]\", Hiro invents [[Skymaxes|Skymax]], which act as a remote-controlled transportation system for Big Hero 6's armor. Though there was initially only one Skymax, five more were created by the time of \"[[Kentucky Kaiju]]\". \"[[Big Problem]]\" introduced the team to Ultra Armor\u2014titanium reinforced battle armor meant to withstand greater amounts of damage from enemies. In terms of appearance, Ultra Armor resembles the team's original suits, albeit with a slick, silver-gray metallic surface. Upgraded versions of Ultra Armor that incorporates the color schemes of the team were introduced in \"[[Prey Date]]\".\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the film, [[Fred (Big Hero 6)|Fred]] gave the name \"Fred's Angels\" to the team with his own theme song, a nod to ''Charlie's Angels''. In \"[[Baymax Returns]]\", it is Fred that officially dubs them \"Big Hero 6\".\n*In the original comics, the team was comprised of Baymax, Hiro Takachiho (Hiro's Marvel counterpart), Honey Lemon, Go Go Tomago, and Marvel mutants Silver Samurai and Sunfire. After the latter two left the team, Wasabi and Fred replaced them as the team's current roster. Due to Silver Samurai and Sunfire being owned by 20th Century Fox at the time, Wasabi and Fred are introduced as the founding members of the team instead.\n*According to\u00a0''Big Hero 6''<nowiki/>'s character design supervisor,\u00a0Jin Kim, one of the main goals of this movie was to introduce multiracial characters to allow everyone to feel some familiarities about their own culture and introduce the world's racial diversity.\n**[[Hiro Hamada]]\u00a0is Japanese-American.\n**[[Go Go Tomago]]\u00a0is Korean.\n**[[Honey Lemon]]\u00a0is Latina.\n**[[Wasabi]]\u00a0is African-American.\n**[[Fred (Big Hero 6)|Fred]]\u00a0is Caucasian.\n***Kim revealed that the lead characters, although they were later given Japanese names, were originally envisioned as Koreans during development with the chief character designer,\u00a0Shiyoon Kim.\n*As of now, [[Heathcliff]], [[Yokai|Robert Callaghan]], [[Alistair Krei]], [[Judy (Big Hero 6)|Judy]], [[Obake]], [[Noodle Burger Boy]], [[Mr. Frederickson]], [[Professor Granville]], [[Globby]], [[Felony Carl]], [[Momakase]], [[Roddy Blair]], [[Megan Cruz]], [[Mrs. Frederickson]] and [[Chief Cruz]] are the only characters to know the true identities of Big Hero 6.\n**[[Richardson Mole]] learned their identities in \"[[Big Hero 7]]\", but his memory was wiped by the end of the episode.\n**[[Trina]] is aware of Hiro and Baymax's identities, but it has not been specified if she knows the same of Go Go, Wasabi, Honey, and Fred.\n**[[Di Amara]] and [[Chris (Big Hero 6)|Chris]] are aware of Hiro and Baymax's identities, but are not aware of the rest of the team's identities.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nBH6Teamnearthesea.png|The Big Hero 6 on Akuma Island\nBH6TeamEmbarassed.png\nBH6Teaminaction.jpg|The Big Hero 6 in battle with [[Yokai]]\nBig Hero five.jpg|The team minus Baymax (who has sacrificed himself to save Hiro)\nBaymax Returns 25.png|The team in ''[[Big Hero 6: The Series]]''\nBH6-The-Series-23.jpg\nBH6 suits.png|The suits\nFran Fiction 1.png|Chibi Big Hero 6\nBig Hero 6 Ultra Armor.jpeg|Ultra Armor\nGlobby hugs big hero 6.jpeg\nBig Hero 6 - The Series S2.jpg\nBig Hero 6 Ultra Armor 2.0.png|Ultra Armor 2.0\n</gallery>\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nBig Hero 6 Concept.jpg\nBig Hero 6 Team Early concept.jpg|Early concept art of the team\nbh6 concept line-up.jpg\nBigHero6membersonbookcover.jpg\nBig Hero 6 team Illustrated Render II.png\nBig Hero 6 Bandai.png\nBig Hero 6 TV series cast.png|The team as they appear in the TV series\nBH6 TV key art.png\nBH6 symbols.png|Symbols that represent each member\nDisney Magic Kingdoms - Big Hero 6 splash screen.png|Big Hero 6, as they appear in ''Disney Magic Kingdoms''\nBig Hero 6 Kingdom Hearts.jpg|Big Hero 6, as they appear in ''Kingdom Hearts III''\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*{{Marvel.com|/universe/Big_Hero_6}}\n*[[w:c:marvel-movies:Big Hero 6 (team)|Big Hero 6 (team) on Marvel Movies Wiki]]\n*[[w:c:big-hero-6:Big Hero 6 (team)|Big Hero 6 (team) on the Big Hero 6 Wiki]]\n*[[w:c:marvel:Big Hero 6 (Earth-14123)|Big Hero 6 (team) on the Marvel Database]]\n\n{{Big Hero 6}}\n{{Kingdom Hearts}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Big Hero 6}}\n[[de:Big Hero 6]]\n[[Category:Big Hero 6 characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Superheroes]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts characters]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]"
