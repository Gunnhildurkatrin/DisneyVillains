I'm your commanding officer, General Knowledge. And it's my job to turn you mealy-mouthed meatheads into a crack squadron of Cranium Commandos. Your job - if you can cut it - will be to run the most sophisticated information system ever devised: the human brain.|General Knowledge's introduction}}\n'''General Knowledge''' is a character from the extinct [[Epcot]] attraction ''[[Cranium Command]]''.\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n=== Cranium Command ===\nGeneral Knowledge appears as the face of the Cranium Command organization throughout the attraction's queue. In the pre-show, he is sent to oversee the deployment of new Commandos, dramatically entering the scene through a broken wall. A short-tempered motor mouth drill sergeant type of character, he shifts his attention to the small and meek [[Buzzy]] and threatens him with piloting the brain of a chicken should he fail. When he is assigned \"the most unstable craft in the fleet\", a teenage boy, Knowledge immediately thinks his superiors made a mistake.\n\nIn the main show, General Knowledge appears to advise Buzzy when he gets in over his head and overblows his fears at school, advising to \"Use your head, don't lose your head\". Buzzy pulls through and General Knowledge congratulates him for his success.\n\n=== [[The Walt Disney World Explorer]] ===\nIn the program's page on the attraction, the CD-ROM's narrator, [[Corey Burton]], points out that he voices General Knowledge and shifts into doing his voice while talking about the attraction.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nGeneral Knowledge.jpg\ngeneral-knowledge Vinylmation.jpg|Vinylmation figure\nEarly Cranium Command Designs Mural.jpeg|Early designs for General Knowledge and Buzzy on a mural in MetLife's Corporate Lounge\nBuzzyandGeneralKnowledge.jpg|Development sketch of General Knowledge and Buzzy\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Generals]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Military characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Soldiers]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
