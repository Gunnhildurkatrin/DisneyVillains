He is attached to and protective of [[Maya Hart]] and [[Riley Matthews]] and loves them both equally, though by the end of the show's run, the relationship can be seen as one of only close friendship. He is the son of his teacher [[Cory Matthews]]' old classmate [[Stuart Minkus]].\u00a0\n\n== Personality ==\nFarkle is shown to care a lot about his education and could be seen as a teacher's pet. He has a habit of speaking in third person, usually referring to himself by his own name rather than \"I.\" His best friend [[Lucas Friar|Lucas]] considers him the most loyal guy he knows. Farkle is cheerful in almost all situations, and is fully confident in his capability of someday taking over the world.\n\n==Appearance==\nFarkle had brown hair with bangs that took up his forehead in earlier seasons. By later seasons, his hairstyle can be seen to have modernized in that it is more swept up or off to the side. He has blue eyes and wears funky clothes. Usually, he wears colored jeans and wore multi-colored shirts over his trademark turtleneck sweaters, but in more recent seasons, Farkle's style changed. In new episodes you can find him usually wearing dark colored t-shirts, hoodies and jeans. An example of his new style can be seen below.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFarkle_&_Zay_-_Rah_Rah.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Girl Meets World}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Minkus, Farkle}}\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Girl Meets World characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]"
