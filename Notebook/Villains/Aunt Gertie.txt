She is Huey, Dewey, and Louie's aunt. She is voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]].\n\n==Background==\n\n===Personality===\nAunt Gertie is the epitome of a relative whom the family sees on special occasions, especially holidays. She is extremely kind and very lovable (much to the dismay of [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]], who don't take too kindly to her affectionate kisses). Throughout the segment, her personality from changes significantly, going from very excitable (when she first arrives), to frantically terrified (during the dinner fiasco) to extremely emotional (when the boys redeem themselves on the last day of Christmas). She is very family-oriented and cares a great deal about being with the family on the holiday. She got along with both Daisy and [[Scrooge McDuck|Scrooge]] during the family activities. \n\n===Physical Appearance===\nAunt Gertie is a very tall female duck. Like the rest of the Donald Duck character cast, she has white feathers and a golden-yellow beak. Clothing-wise, she wears a tight-fitted purple button-up blouse with three large dark-purple buttons running down the front and a matching purple skirt and heels. She accessorizes with a beautiful blue bowtie around her neck attached to a tan sunhat with a pink flower in it. Occasionally, she is also seen carrying around a small tan purse.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas]]''===\nAppearing in the \"Stuck on Christmas\" segment starring [[Donald Duck]], Gertie, [[Scrooge McDuck|Scrooge]], and [[Daisy Duck|Daisy]] arrive at Donald's house during Christmas Day just as Gertie happily kisses the nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie. One Christmas night, Gertie is present during Christmas dinner and after having dinner, Gertie sings \"We Wish You a Merry Christmas\" with Scrooge playing the piano along with Donald and Daisy. Due to the nephews' wish of having Christmas Day every day causing an endless Christmas lapse to happen every day, Gertie ends up celebrating Christmas continuously, especially on having a perfect Christmas Day the nephews wished for until the nephews realize the true meaning of Christmas, causing the endless loop to end and shift into the day after Christmas.\n\n==Trivia==\n*It's never stated whose side of the family she's on. But given how Donald insisted on the boys respecting their aunt, she's probably an aunt on Donald's side. However, Donald only had one sister, Della, and Della was the mother of Huey, Dewey, and Louie, so Gertie must have been Daisy's sister.\n*She is inspired by, not to be confused with, [https://raccoons.fandom.com/wiki/Gertie_Raccoon ''The Raccoons'' character of the same name].\n\n{{Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas}}\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Aunts]]\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Duck Family]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]"
