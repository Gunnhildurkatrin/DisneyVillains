He lives at the Martians Artists Commune on [[Mars]], and is a very helpful companion during Frida's art hikes.\n\nThe glowing quills on his back are actually paint brushes that Frida uses for her paintings and they can also extend to become poles for all sorts of purposes, such as hiking, climbing, and pole vaulting. His other features include gravity feet to help him scale mountain walls and can hide his quills whenever he hitches a ride on someone's shoulder.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"180\" spacing=\"small\">\nBrenda-song-miles-from-tomorrowland-excl-first-look-02.jpg\nBrenda-song-miles-from-tomorrowland-excl-first-look-01.jpg\nMiles vs. The Volcano concept 2.jpg|Concept design\n</gallery>\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Miles from Tomorrowland}}\n[[Category:Porcupines]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Miles from Tomorrowland characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
