She is the daughter of [[Mother Rabbit]] and the older sister of [[Skippy (Robin Hood)|Skippy]], [[Tagalong]], and [[Other Rabbit Siblings|lots of other rabbit siblings]].\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nPersonality-wise, Sis appears to be a typical young girl. She is friendly, but she can be bossy and she likes to tease her brother Skippy. Judging by one scene, she may harbor a slight crush on [[Robin Hood (character)|Robin Hood]], as she mentions that he is handsome, \"just like his reward posters\" upon seeing him in person.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nSis is a white colored rabbit. She wears a long red dress with pink bloomers, and her ears are tied with a large pink hair bow.\n\nShe seems to be taller and skinnier than Skippy and her other siblings, possibly making her the firstborn. In her cameo appearance of ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'', her dress is violet colored.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Robin Hood (film)|Robin Hood]]''===\nSis plays a fairly minor role in the film, having a major role in only one or two scenes. The rest of her appearances are cameos.\n\nShe is seen with her family at Skippy's birthday party. Like the rest of them, she is angry when [[the Sheriff of Nottingham]] steals Skippy's birthday present, but cheers up with Robin Hood comes with his own present for him. She takes a moment to tease Skippy about Robin's hat is too big, before being scolded by [[Mother Rabbit|her mother]] and to have [[Tagalong|her little sister]] repeat the scolding.\n\nShe then goes with Skippy, Tagalong, and their friend, [[Toby Turtle|Toby]], to go test out Skippy's new bow and arrow. She warns him that he is shooting the arrow too high, and watches him do so into Prince John's courtyard. When [[Maid Marian]] invites them in, Sis notes that the former is very nice and encourages Toby and Tagalong to come. She watches as Skippy role-plays Robin's rescue of Marian and laughs when [[Lady Kluck]] mimics [[Prince John]] and when Marian kisses Skippy.\n\nShe later has a few cameos throughout the rest of the film. She attends the archery tournament and is seeing cheering for the competitors. Later, she is shown during the song \"[[The Phony King of England]]\". After that, she is imprisoned alongside the rest of her family, for not paying taxes, and later escapes along with them (ducking and jumping to dodge arrows). She appears at the end as the newlywed Robin Hood and Maid Marian ride off to which she catches Marian's bouquet much to Tagalong's madness.\n\n===''[[Once Upon a Time in Wonderland]]''===\nSis appears on the ''[[Once Upon a Time]]'' spin-off show as the daughter of the [[White Rabbit]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" orientation=\"none\" spacing=\"small\">\nTumblr n4wrd4vDh61rxt9glo7 1280.jpg\nTumblr n0npgtXJxQ1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\nfev152.gif|Sis and Toby\nGrandma.jpg|Sis's cameo in ''Mickey's Christmas Carol''\nWhite Rabbit's daughter.png|Sis on ''Once Upon a Time in Wonderland''\n</gallery>\n\n{{Robin Hood}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sis}}\n[[fr:Grande soeur]]\n[[Category:Rabbits]]\n[[Category:Robin Hood characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:English characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Mickey's Christmas Carol characters]]\n[[Category:Raw Toonage Characters]]\n[[Category:Once Upon a Time characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse Works characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
