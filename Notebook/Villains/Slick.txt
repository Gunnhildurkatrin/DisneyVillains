'''Experiment 020''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]].\u00a0He is designed to\u00a0sell anything\u00a0to anyone like a professional\u00a0by using his sales pitch and auctioneer-like stratagems. However, once he starts selling, he is not programmed to stop. His one true place is selling for charity and fundraisers at [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]]'s [[Hula School|hula school]].\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nSlick is a fast-talking, Southern-accented salesman. He is generally very friendly and polite, tipping his hat every time he greets somebody, but is quite obsessive about selling stuff. He won't stop doing so until there is nothing left to sell, even selling himself to [[Mertle Edmonds|Mertle]] through a live auction. He is also very kind-hearted and courteous, and strongly supports his one true place in working for charity.\n\nDespite being incredibly friendly, Slick can also be amazingly fierce. This was shown during the climactic battle in\u00a0''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''. His initial facial expression after [[Stitch]]'s pep talk was fearsome, and at one point during the battle, he had a [[Leroy]]\u00a0[[Leroy Clones|clone]] running from him. Thus, he can easily turn from a friendly salesperson to a terrifying fighter, while still keeping his good intentions.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nSlick is a fast-talking, pink humanoid\u00a0doglike experiment resembling [[Cannonball]], but with a smaller face, a purple nose, and two ebony-black eyes, with hair-like antennae on top of his head. He wears a straw boater hat and bowtie and carries a cane.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nSlick is charismatic and persuasive, as he can sell anything to anyone, even if they have no reason or wouldn't buy it otherwise, by using sympathy and slight exaggeration effects. He can speak fluently and is capable of controlling his facial emotions and voice to persuade customers, and has quick auctioneer-like speaking qualities.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment 020 was the 20th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Jacques von H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to sell anything to anyone until there was nothing available for sale. According to Jumba, 020 once sold the former's [[Jumba's Lab|laboratory]] instead of other experiments, and another time he sold Jumba's ex-wife for an outrageous price. 020 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.\n\nAt an unknown point after this, Experiment 020 was activated.\n\n[[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Stitch]] were both having trouble selling candy bars for a fundraiser at their [[Hula School|hula school]], and encountered\u00a0020 sitting on a park bench reading a newspaper. When 020 heard\u00a0Lilo and Stitch's predicament, he introduced himself to them and presented his card that revealed his number and primary function.\n\nAfterwards, 020, named Slick,\u00a0offered to assist Lilo and Stitch in their fundraising drive. Using his sales pitch, Slick managed to convince every person whom Lilo came across into buying one of her chocolate bars.\n\nHowever, Slick later grew obsessive and began selling everything the Pelekais owned.\u00a0Since they were unable to capture Slick (as he had sold all their containment orbs as well),\u00a0Lilo left [[Pleakley]] in charge of Slick while she and Stitch set out to redeem all of their personal belongings. Among one of them was a trophy that [[Charles and Mary|a couple]] was using to stabilize an outdoor dining table.\n\nWhile they were doing this,\u00a0[[Mertle Edmonds|Mertle]], who\u00a0found out about Slick earlier, showed up at the [[Lilo's House|Pelekais' house]] looking for the salesman experiment. Annoyed, Pleakley tried getting Mertle to leave, but\u00a0Slick let\u00a0her\u00a0come in. When they both demanded custody of Slick, the latter held an impromptu auction and set the opening bid at one dollar. The auction ended with Slick selling himself to Mertle for three dollars.\n\nAfter managing to retrieve all of their household possessions, Lilo and Stitch returned home to discover that Slick was gone. Pleakley explained what happened, prompting Lilo and Stitch to get Slick back.\n\nMeanwhile, Mertle used Slick to solicit candy bars and help her win the contest until Lilo and Stitch stole him, but Mertle managed to steal him back. Later, when Lilo and Stitch (disguised as beekeepers) went over to [[Mertle's House|Mertle's house]] to reclaim Slick, she revealed that she had sold him to [[Reuben|Experiment 625]], much to their horror.\n\nAt [[Gantu's Ship|Gantu's ship]], Slick acquainted himself\u00a0with Reuben and later sold the ship to an old man, who had somehow gained entry. Slick was soon after captured in a container by an ailing\u00a0[[Captain Gantu|Gantu]], who had been repeatedly persuaded by [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]] to do so.\n\nFortunately, Lilo and Stitch arrived and managed to rescue Slick, but Gantu was able to track him down and recapture him. However, Gantu ultimately traded Slick for Lilo's last chocolate bar, claiming it would cure his cold.\n\nShortly after, Slick found his one true place at Lilo's school in raising money for charity.\n\nIn \"[[Ploot (episode)|Ploot]]\", Lilo tried to convince Slick to help her defeat [[Ploot]], but he led Lilo astray by trying to get her to buy a [[Kokaua Town]] umbrella.\n\nIn \"[[Remmy (episode)|Remmy]]\",\u00a0Slick was one of the experiments in Lilo's dream.\n\n===''[[The Origin of Stitch]]''===\nSlick was one of the experiments that were gliding on the screen, but he is 597 instead of 020.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nThe first\u00a0624 experiments, including Slick, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]], and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nSlick participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]], having frightened at least one Leroy clone.\n\nHowever, the Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Slick is one of only four known experiments that wears a hat, the other three being [[Frenchfry]], [[Squeak]], and [[Derrick]]. However, Slick is the only one wearing a true hat that he can remove, while\u00a0Frenchfry's \"hat\" appears to be a part of his head, and it is presumed Squeak can take off his hat since he appears with a fresh hat in [[Leroy & Stitch|the TV film finale]] after an earlier incident with the Evil-liminator, while it is unknown if Derrick can remove his hat or not.\n*Slick was activated off-screen.\n*Slick is one of the few known experiments that can speak fluently.\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
