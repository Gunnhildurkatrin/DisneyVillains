He is one of the five kids that modeled as DHIs (Disney Host Interactive or Daylight Hologram Imaging) to become holographic guides to the Disney Parks. He is one of the Kingdom Keepers. Their goal is to stop the Overtakers from controlling the parks.\n==Biography==\nTerry \u201cDonnie\u201d Maybeck: Maybeck is one effortlessly cool guy. He\u2019s very popular with the girls at school \u2013 probably due to his sarcastic demeanor and sense of humor. He isn\u2019t always enthusiastic about the DHI adventures and he likes to work alone. He sometimes reacts too quickly. His skepticism makes him the perfect devil\u2019s advocate \u2013 Maybeck sees situations in ways the other Keepers don\u2019t always consider.\n==Gallery==\n<gallery captionalign=\"left\">\nMaybeck.png\nMaybeck 1.JPG|Maybeck on Disney After Dark\n</gallery>\n\n{{Kingdom Keepers}}{{DEFAULTSORT:Maybeck, Terrence}}\n[[Category:Kingdom Keepers]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Keepers characters]]\n[[Category:Time travelers]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]"
