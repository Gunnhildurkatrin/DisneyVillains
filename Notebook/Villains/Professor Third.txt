The exact reason why is unknown and there's been no mention or explanation to confirm officially whether he's divorced, separated or widowed. He's first seen towards the end of\u00a0Red Robins Don't Fly, when the show's main safety patrollers are at the Thirds' house playing cards and he serves them hamburgers.\n\nHis only other appearance is in\u00a0<ref>\"A Cold Day at X.\"</ref> In this, he comes down with a cold and his daughters are trying out various remedies to cure him.\n\nHe was mentioned in\u00a0<ref>\"South of Friendship, North of Honor\"</ref>\u00a0by Ingrid that he's working on a book about a 17th century Japanese mathematician and that she'll spend her spring break helping to translate it into the language of the same name.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n{{Fillmore!}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Third, Professor}}\n[[Category:Fillmore characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Schoolteachers]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
