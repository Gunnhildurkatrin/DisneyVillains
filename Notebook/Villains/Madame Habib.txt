Nikki begs her not to buy them from Stratos, and to instead hand them to Mark so that his name will be cleared. When one of her men informs her that someone is coming onboard, she hides Nikki in her wine cabinet and warns her not to make a sound. Stratos boards the ship and shows Madame Habib the emeralds, soon afterwards demanding for the money. Madame Habib assures him that she will find him the money in her safe and leaves to find it. Unfortunately, Stratos find Nikki in the wine cabinet and a fight ensues with Mark joining in. Madame Habib puts an end to the conflict by having her men subdue Stratos. When Stratos insists that the stars cannot lie, she rebuts that everybody lies when it suits their purpose, even the stars, and places him under arrest.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nTumblr n364dg3s4u1qiceiuo1 1280.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:The Moon-Spinners characters]]"
