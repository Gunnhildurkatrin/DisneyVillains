He\u00a0is designed to use his kickboxing skills to bully and defeat opponents in hand-to-hand combat. His one true place is teaching people kickboxing and hosting his own workout video entitled ''Kickboxing with Kixx''.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nKixx is shown to be a talented kickboxer and loves to pick fights, which would consider him a bully. He also appears to be exceedingly dim-witted, but extremely hotheaded and violent. However, after [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Stitch]] befriended him, Kixx has shown to control his temper a lot better.\n\nAlthough not the brightest, Kixx is loyal to those who win his trust. He is valiant and an excellent fighter, but also a really big softie deep down. He enjoys kickboxing, wrestling, and baseball and shows a sign of pride.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nKixx is a purple, brawny {{WikipediaLink|Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|Tasmanian devil}}-like experiment with a violet stomach, chest, ear insides, and spots around his eyes. He has four strong gorilla-like arms with three fingers on each paw and a blue oval spot on each elbow. His legs are significantly smaller and stubbier than his arms, and his head and mouth seem to connect straight to his chest, as there is hardly any neck.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nKixx possesses immense superhuman strength to the degree he is able to overpower Stitch one-on-one. While he lacks some intelligence, Kixx has a repertoire of kickboxing and wrestling techniques he can employ with his four arms, primarily in hand-to-hand combat. Like Stitch, Kixx can roll into a ball. Similar to [[Deforestator]], he can spin into a tornado to deliver consecutive punches to his opponent and is extremely fast when doing so.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment 601 was the 601st experiment to be created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. Hamsterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to use his kickboxing skills to beat up and defeat enemies. 601 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai, with 601's pod landing by a cliff face.\n\nWhen a dehydrated tourist tossed\u00a0a half-full water bottle over the cliff, it landed by a ravine and trickled out water, which touched 601's pod, activating the experiment. 601 then attacked [[Charles and Mary|a couple]], beating them up when the husband angered him. Before long, 601 proceeded to attack and beat up additional tourists who stood in his path.\n\nWhen [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Stitch]]\u00a0arrived\u00a0to find and capture 601, the latter ambushed them. Stitch prepared to fight 601, but his stance faltered due to an earlier snack combo incident in which Stitch's combat training was erased. Lilo was then force to retreat with Stitch, while 601 was distracted with beating up the newly-arrived [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]].\n\nWhile 601 continued his rampage, [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] lent Lilo several books, including one titled ''Fighting Four-Armed Monsters'', to help her re-train and condition Stitch to fight in combat. After he mastered a few training exercises, Stitch was practically ready to battle 601 hand-to-hand.\n\nLater, 601 attacked [[Muscle Bay]], where he defeated all the boxers with ease. Stitch then came\u00a0to challenge 601 to a rematch and had a long-drawn-out battle. At first, 601 was able to easily overpower Stitch, but with Lilo's tutoring and Stitch's coordination, the latter easily defeated 601, who was restrained with ropes.\n\n601, christened Kixx, was shortly after found a one true place teaching other people kickboxing. Back at [[Gantu's Ship|Gantu's ship]], [[Reuben|Experiment 625]] and an injured Gantu watched a TV commercial of Kixx hosting his own instructional workout video. It motivated Gantu to learn kickboxing after being pummeled by Kixx.\n\nKixx reappeared in \"[[Elastico (episode)|Elastico]]\" as one of the audience members for Lilo's hula dance.\n\nIn \"[[The Asteroid]]\", Kixx was one of the six experiments that Stitch convinced to come with him and Lilo to save Earth from an approaching asteroid. Along the journey, Kixx kicked the back of [[Spooky]]'s seat, causing the latter to terrify him. Also, when Kixx grabbed at the free refreshments, only to get slapped by [[Pleakley]], the former beat Pleakley up and took a bag of peanuts for himself. He later endured a clobbering from [[Hammerface]] and helped Stitch remove the [[Jumba's Ship|ship]]'s hyperdrive engine.\n\nKixx made a brief cameo in \"[[Houdini (episode)|Houdini]]\", hosting his recent kickboxing commercial.\n\nIn \"[[Angel (episode)|Angel]]\", Kixx was one of the experiments that\u00a0[[Angel]] reverted to evil using her song, causing the former to beat up athletes, and thus forcing Stitch to fight and defeat him again. Later, Kixx and the other\u00a0depraved experiments attacked Stitch aboard a ship, but Angel turned them back to good before Kixx could land the fatal blow. Working together, the experiments were then able to successfully escape the ship with Stitch.\n\nKixx reappeared in \"[[Slugger (episode)|Slugger]]\" as part of Lilo's softball team.\n\nIn \"[[Shoe (episode)|Shoe]]\", Kixx was one of the experiments that helped turn Jumba's ship into a hotel.\n\nKixx was one of the experiments in \"[[Checkers (episode)|Checkers]]\" that joined Stitch in a rebellion against Gantu.\u00a0Although he did not appear during the battle, he was seen rebuilding the float after Gantu's defeat.\n\nIn \"[[Ploot (episode)|Ploot]]\", Kixx was one of the first team of experiments (along with Deforestator and [[Richter]]) formed to try and stop [[Ploot]]. However, Ploot was easily able to defeat them, forcing the three experiments to retreat.\n\nKixx was seen on a computer screen in \"[[Ace (episode)|Ace]]\", posing as an evil creation of Jumba's as\u00a0part of a hoax to fool [[Mortlegax]], the head of E.G.O. industries.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nThe first 624 experiments, including Kixx, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]] and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nKixx participated in the following battle between the experiments and the\u00a0[[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]] by beating up attacking Leroys.\n\nHowever, the Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe. Kixx joins them for the song by playing the bongos.\n\n===''[[Stitch!]]''===\nKixx made an appearance in the ''Stitch!'' anime along with [[Pix]], [[Boomer (Lilo & Stitch)|Boomer]], [[Slushy]], [[Blowhard]], and [[Slugger]] when [[Yuna Kamihara|Yuna]] and [[Stitch]] visited [[Tokyo Disneyland]]. He made\u00a0a second appearance where [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]] modified\u00a0him with a new samurai style of fighting, along with a samurai outfit to match it. He later appeared in the special ''Stitch and the Planet of Sand''.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink|Kixx}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Kixx was first revealed in a DVD bonus feature of ''[[Stitch! The Movie]]'' in the experiment gallery.\n*Jumba referred to Kixx as \"X-601\" (ex six-oh-one) after being informed by Lilo.\n**Disney has used \"X-\" (X with a hyphen) in promotional material as a shorthand prefix for \"Experiment\".\n*Kixx is named after the soccer team, {{WikipediaLink|Philadelphia KiXX}}.\n*Kixx was mistaken for a wild, four-armed purple pig by [[Charles and Mary|two tourists]] and a radio announcer.\n*The climactic battle between Kixx and Stitch is presented in a western-style theme.\n*Kixx's [[Experiment Pods|pod]]\u00a0color is blue.\n*The [[Experiment Pod Container]] describes Kixx as: \"Experiment 601. Primary function: Hand-to-hand combat.\"\n*Kixx's holographic silhouette appeared in both \"[[Amnesio (episode)|Amnesio]]\" and \"[[Fibber (episode)|Fibber]]\".\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Martial Artists]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Mentors]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]"
