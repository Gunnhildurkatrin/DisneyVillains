The idea never made it past the storyboard process.  Maria Vaz first appeared in  Jos\u00e9 Carioca comic strip in 1942, scripted by Hubie Karp, illustrated by Bob Grant and Paul Murry and inks by Dick Moore and Karl Karp\u00e9.\n\nHowever, she does show up in a large number of comics done in both Holland and Brazil. It seems Rosinha is one of her more well known names. She seems to be featured often in the [[Z\u00e9 Carioca (comics)]] as the daughter of [[Rocha Vaz]] who tries to interfere with her's and Jos\u00e9's relationship as he does not approve of it. There are times when she has tried to get Jos\u00e9 to marry her, but he does his best to avoid being tied down.\n\n==External links==\n*{{Inducks character|Rosinha}}\n*[http://users.cwnet.com/xephyr/rich/dzone/hoozoo/aurora.html Maria Vaz - Disney's HooZoo]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Brazilian characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Parrots]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]"
