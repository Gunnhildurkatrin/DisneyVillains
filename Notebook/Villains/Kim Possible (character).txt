Kim is a high school student and freelance troubleshooter. She is unusual in this field of work due to the fact that she doesn't use a secret identity.\n\n==Background==\nKim comes from Middleton and lives there with her parents and her younger twin brothers. When Kim was a toddler, she met a boy named [[Ron Stoppable]] on her first day of preschool, where the two began their lifelong friendship.\n\nIn her late preteen/early teen years, Kim Possible wanted to supplement her allowance, so she decided to start up her own babysitting business and set up her own website, \"''KimPossible.com''\", under the slogan \"''I can do anything''\", and soon after her site went live, Kim was accidentally contacted by [[Mr. McHenry]] who was in trouble, and was trying to contact a different group of heroes named \"Team Impossible\".\n\nDue to a typing error, he contacted \"''KimPossible.com''\" instead of \"''Impossible.com''\" after the rescue, Kim's fame as a hero grew until she was being contacted for help by people all over the world, even including governments and royalty.\n\n===Personality===\n[[File:Clothes Minded.png|thumb|left|250px|Kim in her new mission outfit in the fourth season.]]\nKim is a confident, tough, brave, strong, and sharp teenager whose awareness of her own abilities is reflected well by her motto, \"I can do anything\". Her typical state of mind is to be bright, positive, and cheerful and she has a kind and caring heart that compels her to help others and to put their well-being above her own, although she can be arrogant at times, and can be jealous when people appear to do things better than she herself can.\n\nHer competitive nature and drive for perfection, as well as some of her insecurities, are consistent with a Type A personality. They also lead her to set high standards for herself and sometimes give her a tendency to be bossy and to set standards for others that are too high - as was evident when she attempted to coach her brothers' soccer team - or to try and do things herself in order to save others from potential failure or harm.\n\nDespite being a freelance hero, she is still a teenage girl and is susceptible to most normal teenage insecurities and growing pains. She gets embarrassed by her parents, pouts when she doesn't get her way, and has a strong desire to fit in with society, the latter trait of which is often one of her biggest weaknesses. Kim's personality traits were most clearly demonstrated when her school was hit by a fictional personality guide fad known as ''animology'', under which she is classified as being a blue fox: a born leader who can't resist a challenge, is driven to excel, and who is a perfectionist. This is never more clear than during the career fair at her school, when Kim was drawn toward international diplomacy: a job she knew was a demanding, extroverted field.\n\nKim has a tendency to be worried about - and be frequently fooled by - appearances. As such, she is often overly concerned about her image and the way in which others see her, sometimes even going so far as to extend these anxieties to others (primarily Ron Stoppable) even though they do not necessarily feel the same way. Owing to this element of her personality, Kim has a tendency to succumb to peer pressure, something she never really manages to overcome until the very end of the third season and she is often unable to see beyond first appearances and impressions or deeper than other peoples' defense mechanisms. Her inability to see the bigger picture in this field has led to several setbacks.\n\nThis is the element of her personality which appears to form the foundations of much of Kim's rivalry with Bonnie, who is similarly competitive and concerned about appearances, and it is often through this rivalry that we see the less-desirable elements of Kim's competitive nature in play, including incidents when she has engaged in tit-for-tat revenge or one-upmanship and when she has competed purely because she doesn't want [[Bonnie (disambiguation)|Bonnie]] to succeed.\n\nDue to her Type A personality, she also has a strong tendency to become frustrated, impatient, or insecure when faced with a field in which she does not instantly excel. This tendency has been displayed several times throughout the franchise, usually in conjunction with an episode subplot or McGuffin revolving around her social life and is often made more notable by the fact that these fields are ones in which either the often-inept Ron or the immature Tweebs excel. Examples of such fields such as cooking, video games, car mechanics, and the duties required of her when she worked at Bueno Nacho during Season 1.\n\nIn addition to the recurring problems caused by her competitive personality and her weakness in the face of peer pressure, Kim has also demonstrated many of the weaknesses that have become clich\u00e9 to teen high school comedy and drama, most of which have been highlighted in individual episodes but aren't evident across the franchise as a whole. Such clich\u00e9s include trapping herself in a position in which she tells an escalating series of lies in order to cover up a much smaller lie, attempting to sabotage an opponent's campaign during a school election, and allowing herself to be baited into angry or unwise courses of action by a rival.\n\nIn the pilot episode \"[[Crush (Kim Possible episode)|Crush]]\", Kim was rendered incapable of coherent speech in the presence of [[Josh Mankey]], her first confirmed love interest. Although a take-charge person as she is in the other areas of her life when faced with asking Josh on a date, Kim was at a complete loss for what to do.\n\nKim lives to please, as she confirmed herself in the episode \"[[Queen Bebe]]\". When Ron asks her why she doesn't \"just say no\" to a request for help, she replies that she's \"just not programmed that way.\" This accounts for why she finds herself unable to refuse a date with [[Brick Flagg]] in \"[[All the News]]\" since she agrees to do it so that Brick won't be so depressed that he'll blow the football game.\n\nAlthough Kim is generally reasonably mature in the usual give-and-take with her parents over what she can and can't do (how late she can stay out, even if it is on a mission saving the world, if she can get a loan to buy new clothes or must instead get an after-school job, etc.), if she really, really wants something it looks like she won't be able to get, she has a \"puppy-dog pout\" that has been seen several times during the show. It becomes a running gag and the pout has even been used against her by others at times.\n\nOne of her greater qualities is her modesty. Whenever she gets a ride to a mission from someone she helped, they always thank her for her help in seemingly impossible situation, but she just answers \"No big\", and that anyone could've done it. Despite having saved the world countless times against impossible odds, she doesn't consider herself anything special, just a basic, average girl. And she is also not a glory-hunter; even if those she helps would only give all the credit to her and her only, she also gives Ron the credit he deserves, even if he didn't really excel.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nKim is tall, slender, and very strong. She has big green eyes and long, thick, orange hair which came down to her shoulders, and when seen from behind is shaped like a heart. She wore her hair in pigtails and a blue dress when she was in Pre-K, and as a preteen, she wore it in one long ponytail and had braces on her teeth. Her original outfit is a green tank top, cargo jeans, and white shoes. She is most iconic in her short black top which exposes her midriff, green cargo pants, black shoes, and gloves. In Season 4, she wears a purple t-shirt, black pants with purple lining, and grey shoes.\n\n===Age===\nKim's age has been debated quite a bit because nothing has been stated that she was any specific age other than 'high school' age, putting her at 14-18. However, in the Season 2 episode \"Car Trouble\", Kim is stated as old enough to get a driver's license, which in most states (the show takes place in the United States) is 16. Kim also had mentioned that Ron took 12 years to kiss her in \"Homecoming Upset\", which indicates that she was 17 as of that episode.\n\nGraduating from high school and considering college acceptance letters in the series finale, \"[[Graduation]]\", would likely put her at a few months shy of 18. During the episode ''Hidden Talent'', Wade constructs a class ring with a mini Kimmunicator inside of it; the ring had an Emerald in the setting, signaling that Kim's birth month could be May (traditional class rings within the United States are often adorned with the wearer's birthstone). Also in a few episodes she shows her love for being a senior as people stare at her, implying that she is a 17 to 18-year-old student.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\n*'''Master Gymnast:''' Kim is extremely athletic and aerobatic, having honed her reflexes, agility, strength, dexterity, and body coordination through years of cheerleading pratice. With her reflexes and agility, she can perform death-defying moves like somersaulting between laser beams with little apparent effort. Despite her frame, Kim is surprisingly strong and is capable of easily hitting someone hard enough to knock them off their feet or even unconscious with a single blow. Kim's gymnastics earned her a position of captain of the cheerleading squad.\n*'''Martial Arts & Kung Fu:''' She is also highly skilled in martial arts, knowing sixteen types of kung fu (as revealed when she threatened Ron in the episode \"Hidden Talent\"), including Praying mantis Kung Fu. Her skills are aptly demonstrated by the fact that she is able to go toe-to-toe against [[Shego]], an older and more experienced villain whose superpowers allow her to tear through reinforced concrete with ease. She is also exceptionally skilled in manny different forms of hand-to-hand combat, and armed and unharmed combat.\n[[File:KimSupersuit.jpg|thumb|250px|Kim in her super suit.]]\n*'''Advanced Learning:''' Kim is also a fast learner, able to pick up new skills quickly, and adapt to new situations as they arise. Among the many talents that she has demonstrated during the series, all are a high level of proficiency in various extreme sports; such as hang-gliding, skiing, and rock climbing, and even Space Shuttle piloting. She also discovers her ability to sing in the episode \"Hidden Talent\".\n*'''Talented Swimmer:''' Kim is a talented swimmer, which she uses to great effect in many of her missions. She was a member of her school's swim team during her sophomore year of school, swam the English Channel, and is an accomplished SCUBA diver.\n*'''Miscellaneous:''' Kim has been mentioned as having gained a varied and ever-growing skill set throughout her mission work. She was regularly called on to serve as a babysitter, detective, unpaid bounty hunter, espionage agent and perhaps most often as a legally-accepted vigilante. In addition, Kim has had experience in a wide variety of fields, including firefighting, animal conservation/protection, natural disaster prevention/rescues, crop dusting and hot air ballooning.\n*'''Keen Intelligence:''' Kim is a naturally intelligent student who maintained a high GPA despite her adventurous lifestyle by using the time she spent traveling to and from missions to study and always made sure that she handled assignments as early as she could in case she was called away on a mission. She was even able to make time for cheerleading practice after school.\nDespite her intelligence, however, Kim is the least scientifically-minded member of her family and did not understand many of the terms, phrases or inventions that her father and brothers built and used regularly.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Kim Possible]]''===\nKim is the protagonist of the series. Accompanied by her friend Ron and his pet mole rat [[Rufus]], Kim embarks in globe-trotting adventures against a slew of villains to protect the world from global domination. Simultaneously, she must also handle the burdens of being a teenager with her own problems and relationships. For the most part, her classmates are aware of her work but do not comment on it unless it affects them directly. At school, she is the head of her cheerleading squad and a straight-A student.\n\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\n[[File:Kim Meets Lilo.png|thumb|250px|Kim with [[Lilo Pelekai]] in the ''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]'' episode \"[[Rufus (episode)|Rufus]]\".]]\nKim made an appearance in the episode \"[[Rufus (episode)|Rufus]]\". After [[Stitch]] is kidnapped by [[Dr. Drakken]] she was called by [[Pleakley]] after he found a magazine with a cover of her. She and [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] weren't on friendly terms until they realized that they would have to work together to stop Dr. Drakken. Kim went out to find Drakken's secret base and rescue Stitch, however, she gets sucked into a current (\"People Eater\") and also taken hostage. Eventually, Stitch and Kim are rescued from their prison by Lilo and Rufus. Everyone then manages to escape the underwater base. Later, Lilo teaches Kim how to dance the hula, and everyone has a good time together.\n\n===[[Kim Possible (film)|''Kim Possible'' (film)]]===\n[[File:Kim Possible (film) (63).png|thumb|250px|Kim Possible in the live-action film.]]\nKim Possible is the protagonist of the live-action movie, portrayed by [[Sadie Stanley]] in her film debut. Unlike her animated counterpart, this version of Kim is depicted as a jealous attention-seeker who cares more about validation than actually saving the world, and is far more emotionally vulnerable, which is evident in how she is often doubting herself and crying many times in the film ever since Athena became more popular than her.\n\nThe film takes place before the series, where Kim begins her first year at [[Middleton High School]] and must navigate an intimidating new social hierarchy. She is ready to tackle the challenge head-on, just as she has with everything else in life, but her confidence is shaken when she faces roadblocks at every turn\u2014getting lost in the confusing hallways, being late to class and facing rejection during soccer tryouts from her frenemy, Bonnie. Kim's day starts to turn around when she and Ron meet and befriend [[Athena (Kim Possible)|Athena]], who becomes the newest member of Team Possible. \n\nUnfortunately for Kim, Athena quickly proved to be far superior to Kim herself, so much to the point that she even gets pushed aside by the entire school in favor of Athena, which eventually causes Kim to have an emotional breakdown. Later on, Drakken kidnaps Athena, where it is revealed that Athena is a gynoid built by Drakken specifically just to demotivate and humiliate Kim into a total weakling. Kim then realizes this truth as well.\n\nAs Kim short-circuits the transfer machine, Dr. Drakken is turned into a pre-adolescent version of himself. Despite Kim's insistence that she leaves with them and save herself, Athena stays behind to turn off the now-unstable machine. The lair explodes and Athena is presumed killed but it is revealed that she has survived the explosion but her robotic parts are scattered. Kim and Ron take her home to be repaired and programmed to be a hero alongside themselves as they try to go back to their normal lives. As they go back to high school, Kim, Ron, and Athena form a martial arts club with the rest of the class joining, except Bonnie who is infuriated as she walks away humiliated.\n\n===Other appearances===\n[[File:Kim Possible's Spot the Diff cameo.jpg|thumb|250px|Kim's cameo in the ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'' spot the diff episode \"[[Lawn Gnome Beach Party of Terror]]\".]]\nIn the ''[[Phineas and Ferb|Phineas and Ferb Spot the Diff]]'' episode \"Lawn Gnome Beach Party of Error\", a changed episode from \"[[Lawn Gnome Beach Party of Terror]]\", Kim Possible is seen fighting with [[Perry the Platypus]] and [[Heinz Doofenshmirtz]] in her Season 4 outfit.\n\nShe was mentioned in ''[[The Proud Family]]'' episode \"The Legend of Johnny Lovely\" by [[Penny Proud]] during a statement she made about strong females.\n\nIn ''[[American Dragon: Jake Long]]'', Kim is seen fighting a \"clone robot\" with sidekick and best-friend, [[Ron Stoppable]]. [[Jake Long]] noticed her and called her \"legendary\".\n\nA poster featuring Kim Possible can be seen in ''[[The Santa Clause 2]]''\n\n== Video Games ==\n\n=== ''[[Disney Heroes: Battle Mode]]'' ===\nKim Possible appears as an unlockable character, she is one of the first characters from an animated series to appear in the game and her abilities/gadgets for the missions she uses are the same as those used in the game. Her apperance and as well other Kim Possible characters (Dr. Drakken, Shego, Ron, and Rufus) in-game are before final battle in [[Kim Possible Movie: So the Drama]], and Kim and Ron are still friends, not a couple, as in the end of the movie and following in the season 4. \n\nKim's friends are [[Darkwing Duck (character)|Darkwing Duck]] and [[Joy]]. \n\n==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==\n[[File:ParkKim.jpg|thumb|250px|Kim posing for a photo at Disney's Hollywood Studios.]]\nKim and Ron appeared at the [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] park as walk-around characters on the Streets of America. They also had starred in the [[Kim Possible World Showcase Adventure]] game at [[Epcot]] guiding guests on their missions through Kimmunicators while they travel around the lagoon. This attraction was replaced by [[Agent P's World Showcase Adventure]] in [[2012]].\n\n==Relationships==\n{{Relationshipslink}}\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Her name, like many in her family, is an allusion to the word \"impossible\".\n*Kim collects Cuddle Buddies, and cannot go to sleep without her Pandaroo, though she is not as obsessed about them as [[DNAmy]] is.\n*She hates being called \"Kimmy-Cub\" in public by her father revealed in \"[[The Truth Hurts]]\".\n*She looks identical to her Aunt Miriam.\n**As everything in \"[[Rewriting History]]\" except for their waking at the end was a dream, \"Aunt Mim\" may not have been real.\n*Given her complaint towards Ron on how long it took him to kiss her, Kim may have had a crush on [[Ron Stoppable|Ron]] since she was very little.\n*She unofficially appeared as a pop-cultural cameo in the 2004 Academy-Award nominated documentary film ''Super Size Me'' representing the \"Gotta-Have-Em\" toys for children on McDonalds Happy Meals.\n*Kim was initially going to be blond and have a much older appearance that was loosely based on Bob Schooley and Mark McCorkle's assistant, Jessica. The designs were considered \"too old and worldly\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/bob_schooley/status/1250991021955051521|title=Bob Schooley Tweet|website=Twitter|date=April 16, 2020}}</ref>\n*In the [[Kim Possible (film)|live-action film]], Kim is shown to be deathly afraid of electric eels. This is despite the fact that in the [[Kim Possible|original cartoon]] the episode \"[[Rufus in Show]]\" reveals that electric eels do not even frighten her anyway, as evident via her reaction when [[Wade]] reminds her of the electric eels \"The bad villain puns just write themselves. Shocking, isn't it?\".\n*Kim's character design changed slightly over the course of the series; originally in Season 1 she was drawn with smaller eyes and thicker eyebrows, but as of Season 2 onwards she now had larger eyes and thinner eyebrows.\n** Kim's appearance in the ''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]'' episode \"[[Rufus (episode)|Rufus]]\" is drawn based on her Season 1 design, despite the fact that said crossover episode aired in [[2005]]. \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[[w:c:kimpossible:Kim Possible|Kim Possible Wiki: Kim Possible]]\n\n{{Kim Possible}}\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Possible, Kim}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Kim Possible}}\n[[da:Kim Possible (karakter)]]\n[[es:Kim Possible (personaje)]]\n[[pl:Kim Kolwiek (posta\u0107)]]\n[[pt-br:Kim Possible (personagem)]]\n[[Category:Kim Possible characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Detectives]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Martial Artists]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Cheerleaders]]\n[[Category:Fillmore characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Nieces]]\n[[Category:Warriors]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Spies]]\n[[Category:Time travelers]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Heroes: Battle Mode characters]]\n[[Category:Monkeys]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
