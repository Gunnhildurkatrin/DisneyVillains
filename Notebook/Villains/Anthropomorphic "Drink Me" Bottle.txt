He was eventually replaced by the [[The Doorknob|Doorknob]]. He was planned to be voiced by [[Cliff Edwards]].\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''===\nAfter [[Alice]] told him that she was too big to fit through the door, the Bottle was to have offered her a sip of his contents, to which she objected, fearing that they might be poison. The Bottle would have become offended at this, but would have allowed Alice to sniff his liquid to be sure, anyway. Later on, as she began to flood the room with her tears, the Bottle was to have offered Alice another drink, which would have made her smaller.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Unlike the other known deleted characters, this character would have been an original character for the film.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\">\nDrinkMeBottleandAlice.jpg|Alice encounters the Bottle for the first time, by David Hall\nDrinkMeBottleandAlice (2).jpg|The Bottle tells Alice that she forgot the key, by David Hall\nAliceAndDrinkMeBottle (3).jpg|The Bottle watches as Alice takes a sip of his contents, by David Hall\nDrinkMeBottle (2).jpg|The Bottle runs away from Alice's tears, by David Hall\nAliceAndDrinkMeBottle (4).jpg|The Bottle tries to get Alice to stop crying, by David Hall\nDrinkMeBottle (3).jpg|The Bottle creates a table by using his bubbles, by David Hall\nDrinkMeBottle (4).jpg\nDrinkMeBottle (5).jpg\n14a.jpg\nDrinkMeBottle (6).jpg\nDrinkMeBottle (7).jpg\nDrinkMeBottleandAlice (3).jpg\nDrinkMeBottleandAlice (4).jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Alice in Wonderland}}\n[[Category:Deleted characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Alice in Wonderland characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Alice In Wonderland objects]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
