Uncouthma is going to marry Brawnhilda and his royal vizier, [[Runta]], is going to announce the wedding. But Brawnhilda says that she loves Aladdin, which makes Uncouthma angry at the street rat because he thinks he stole the woman from him. Later, Jasmine tells Uncouthma that he has to fight for Brawnhilda. But Uncouthma thinks she meant a fight to the death with Aladdin. When [[Genie]] shows Uncouthma that the mallets Runta gave them are bombs, Aladdin and Uncouthma go after Runta. After defeating Runta, Brawnhilda has romantic feelings for Uncouthma again and the two marry.\n\n===[[Smells Like Trouble]]===\nBrawnhilda and Uncouthma introduce their son Bud to Aladdin and his friends. Uncouthma tries to show his son that Aladdin is strong, but the street rat proves that he is weak. When Aladdin was fighting at a boxing ring with a muscular Odiferan, Uncouthma sees a stinker-breath lizard eat the trophy made of cheese and he takes it out. The lizard then breaths on Uncouthma and he passes out, with his face turning green with purple spots. Later, after the lizards eat the peppermint-covered cheese, the gang makes the lizards breath on Uncouthma and he wakes up.\n===[[Aladdin and the King of Thieves]]===\nBrawnhilda and her family make cameos near the end of the film, when Aladdin and Jasmine finally get married. They are standing in a crowd with some other characters from the series when Aladdin and Jasmine are walking at the wedding procession path with [[Rajah]] holding Jasmine's wedding dress.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink|}}\n\n\n{{Aladdin}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Aladdin characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Princesses]]"
