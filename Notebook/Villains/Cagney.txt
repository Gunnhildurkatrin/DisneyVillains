In late [[1996]], Cagney was about three years old.\n\nCagney is, fortunately, good at looking after himself when Elisa is absent. When Elisa disappeared during the Avalon World Tour, [[Brooklyn]], [[Broadway]], [[Lexington]], and [[Hudson]] took Cagney back to the clock tower, where he and Hudson developed a friendship. <ref>''[[Kingdom (Gargoyles)|Kingdom]]''</ref> Cagney approved of Jason Conover when he briefly stopped by at Elisa's apartment. <ref>''[[Hunter's Moon]]'', Part Two</ref>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Gargoyles}}\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Gargoyles characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
