He first appeared in the episode \"[[Meet Armadylan]]\". He is an armadillo-like boy who wanted to be a superhero like the [[PJ Masks (team)|PJ Masks]] by joining their team, but before he could join them, he must learn how to use his powers right.\n\n\n\n==Description==\nArmadylan wraps into a ball and thunders about the city trying to do all the cool hero stuff, but doesn't really see what it means to be a hero and ends up trying to outdo the PJ's and wreck their plans.\n\n===Personality===\nArmadylan is reckless and clumsy, due to him not having his powers for very long, as he always causes destruction and gets the PJ Masks and himself into accidents. He wants to show the PJ Masks his abilities, which often leads to destruction. He is ill-tempered and stubborn, though he can sometimes be friendly.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nArmadylan has fair skin, light brown eyes, and is taller and older than the PJ Masks. His superhero outfit consists of a tan-and-brown armadillo armor with a helmet and a tail-cape with a tan-and-brown armadillo symbol on the chest.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\n*'''Rolling Thunder''': Allows him to use his cape to roll into a ball.\n*'''Dig Attack''': With capacity of digging tunnels.\n*'''Super Strength''': Same power as Gekko.\n*'''Thunder Thump/Ground Pound''': Allows him to create strong earthquakes.\n*'''Armor-Plated Smash Attack''': An ability which allows him to destroy anything with a punch.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Armadylan's favorite animal is an armadillo.\n*He does not appear in every episode, even though he's now a new PJ Mask member.\n*His color scheme is orange.\n*Armadylan is the only member to wear a helmet and armor, instead of a jumpsuit and mask.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nArmadylan concept art.jpg|Armadylan's concept art\nCatboy and Armadylan handshake.jpg|Catboy and Armadylan handshake\nRomeo irritates Armadylan.png\nYeah, I'd really thought that Romeo wanted to work with me.png\nArmadylan and Owlette reading the flossy flash comics.png\nCatboy, Owlette and Gekko falls on Armadylan.png\nArmadylan tries to break free.png\nArmadylan is freed from Romeo's trap.png\nArmadylan stats.jpg\nPJ Masks laugh together with Armadylan.png\nPj Masks Together.png\nArmadillain 3.png\nArmadillain 04 by mcsaurus-dc93ho8.png\n4ttth.jpg\nDkqeKgyXsAA4M-o.png\nArmadillain with Gekko.png|Armadylan with Gekko\nScreenshot 20180923-024000.png\nVictory pose with Armadylan.png\nVideoCapture 20190213-190911.jpg\nScreenshot 20181029-073107.png\nThere\u2019s always room for another good guy.jpg\nArmadylan style!.png\nArmadylan on a flat car.jpg\nB47D22B1-BFBF-498D-A129-16199B706936.png|Armadylan: Give me that stick, Dragon Girl.
