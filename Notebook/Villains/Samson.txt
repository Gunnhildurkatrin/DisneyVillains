He is the faithful and valiant steed of [[Prince Phillip]].\n\n==Background==\nAlthough Samson does not speak aside from neighing, he seems to have some intelligence, being astute enough to know the way to [[King Stefan's Castle|his residence]] by memory.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Sleeping Beauty]]''===\nSamson is first introduced with Phillip, 16 years after [[Maleficent]]'s curse and [[Aurora]]'s life as Briar Rose first began. He and Phillip are out riding when Phillip is suddenly intrigued by the beautiful singing voice of a [[Aurora|peasant girl]] and is determined to investigate. Samson is initially against this course change, but Phillip convinces him to go along when he promises Samson an extra bag of oats and a few carrots) to eat. However, after failing to woo her, an embarrassed Phillip denies Samson those extra carrots.\n\nLater on, after heading back from Stefan\u2019s kingdom to the [[Forest of No Return|forest]] to meet with the peasant girl again, Phillip and Samson are kidnapped by Maleficent and her [[Maleficent's Goons|goons]] and are hauled off to her castle at the [[Forbidden Mountain]]. There, the [[Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather|Three Good Fairies]] arrive to the rescue, freeing the duo. The team races out of the castle and towards [[King Stefan's Castle|King Stefan\u2019s castle]] where Aurora has fallen into a deep, sleep-like death, with a kiss of true love being the only thing capable of awakening her. But as they race to the rescue, Maleficent unleashes her wrath by turning herself into a dragon and knock Phillip off Samson's saddle with her fire breathing power. The two battle and the battle ends when the evil fairy-turned-dragon is stabbed by Phillip\u2019s Sword of Truth that was magically empowered by the enraged good fairies, who finally have had enough of Maleficent. After Maleficent is destroyed, Samson, Phillip, and the three fairies head towards the castle and with True Love\u2019s Kiss, the princess is finally awakened, along with the others in the kingdom, including [[King Stefan]], [[Queen Leah]], [[King Hubert]], [[Minstrel]], and the [[Lord Duke|Herald]]\n\n===''[[Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: Follow Your Dreams]]''===\nSamson appears in ''Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: Follow Your Dreams'' in the Keys to the Kingdoms segment. He is first seen when [[Prince Phillip|Phillip]] and [[Aurora]] are walking and talking all about Aurora taking over while he leaves, which Samson interrupts them.\n\nHe is seen again when Phillip is heading to and returning from the Royal Conference. Phillip is seen riding him, instead of riding the carriage with Hubert, Stefan, and Leah. Samson is seen arriving back to the palace with Phillip, along with the two kings and Leah, when Lord Duke comes running to the carriage and warns them about the giant chickens, green pigs, and cows he saw in the throne room. After they enter the palace, Samson is not seen again for the remainder of the first segment.\n\n== Printed Media ==\n\n=== An Amazing Team ===\nSamson's relationship with Aurora is explored in \"An Amazing Team\" a short story featured in 5 minute Disney Girl Power Stories.\n\nSamson is upset because he can't compete in an upcoming joust due to Prince Philip being away, but while taking him out for a ride, Aurora gets an idea that since Philip won't be there, she and Samson should compete in the joust together. Samson is delighted by the idea and he and Aurora practice together in the same place where he and Philip practiced jousting. In the end, even though they don't come in first place, Samson and Aurora prove that the two of them make a great team.  \n\n==Trivia==\n*Though far from the first major [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] horse character, Samson set the stage for many horse companion characters in future Disney films, acting like a stubborn, but lovable companion to their masters. Examples of this include [[Philippe]] in ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', [[Pegasus]] in ''[[Hercules (film)|Hercules]]'', and [[Maximus]] in ''[[Tangled]]''.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Concept Art===\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nSleeping Beauty Sheets 12.jpg\nSleeping Beauty Sheets 13.jpg\nSleeping Beauty Sheets 15.jpg\nSleeping Beauty Sheets 16.jpg\nSleeping Beauty Sheets 18.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nPrince-Spotlight-Series-Prince-Phillip-9.png\nSleeping-beauty-disneyscreencaps.com-2695.jpg\nSleeping-beauty-disneyscreencaps.com-2702.jpg\nSleeping-beauty-disneyscreencaps.com-2784.jpg\nPhilip0001.jpg\nSleeping-beauty-disneyscreencaps.com-3183.jpg\nPhilip0002.jpg\nPrince-phillip-005.jpg\nSleeping-beauty-disneyscreencaps.com-3693.jpg\nSleeping-beauty-disneyscreencaps.com-5083.jpg\nSleeping-beauty-disneyscreencaps.com-5185.jpg\nSleeping-beauty-disneyscreencaps.com-5240.jpg\nSleeping-beauty-disneyscreencaps.com-5259.jpg\nSleeping-beauty-disneyscreencaps.com-6551.jpg\nSleeping-beauty-disneyscreencaps.com-6568.jpg\nSleeping-beauty-sleeping-beauty-4908422-720-480.jpg\nPrince, Princess & Horse.jpg\nPrince, Princess & Horse (1).jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Merchandise and Miscellaneous ===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nSamson1.jpg\nJcwk.jpg\nYfjj.jpg\nPrince Phillip Card.jpeg\nMaleficent -My Side of the Story06.jpg\nSleeping Beauty Samson Plush.jpg\nSleeping Beauty 2014 Disney Store Doll Set.jpg\nSleeping Beauty 2014 Disney Store Doll Set Boxed.jpg\nSleeping Beauty Diamond Edition Love is an Adventure Promotion.jpg\nDisney Princess Aurora's Story Illustraition 13.jpg\nDisney Princess Aurora's Story Illustraition 7.jpg\nAurora's Royal Wedding (4).jpg\nAurora's Royal Wedding (2).jpg\nAurora-Wallpaper-disney-princess.jpg\nSamson-Aurora.JPG\nFile:A Moment to Remember (3).jpg\nFile:A Moment to Remember (4).jpg\nFile:A Moment to Remember (6).jpg\nFile:A Moment to Remember (7).jpg\nFile:An Amazing Team (1).jpg\nFile:An Amazing Team (2).jpg\nFile:An Amazing Team (3).jpg\nFile:An Amazing Team (4).jpg\nFile:An Amazing Team (5).jpg\nFile:An Amazing Team (6).jpg\nSamsontsumtsum.jpg\nMay108.gif\nFile:Aurora-samson4.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Sleeping Beauty}}\n{{Once Upon a Time}}\n{{DisneyTsumTsum}}\n[[fr:Samson]]\n[[pt-br:Sans\u00e3o]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Sleeping Beauty characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Horses]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Maleficent characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:French characters]]\n[[Category:Once Upon a Time characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]"
