He is [[Mr. Big (Zootopia)|Mr. Big]]'s most trusted henchman, and a member of his [[Tundratown]] mafia.\n==Background==\nAs mentioned above, Koslov is the brooding head crony of Mr. Big's mafia organization. He is often tasked with transporting the shrew to different locations. He doesn't speak, and rarely emotes, but has a soft spot for Mr. Big's deceased grandmother.\n\nInterestingly, Koslov's role as Mr. Big's assistant is not his sole profession; outside of the mob, he owns a local tailor shop specializing in suits for \"refined mammals\" called ''Koslov's''.\n===Development===\nIn early drafts, Koslov was known as '''Boris Koslov'''.<ref>[https://vimeo.com/157756360 ''Imagining Zootopia'', extended scene. Documentary, 2016]</ref> As opposed to Mr. Big, Koslov was going to be the antagonist encountered in Tundratown, having a larger role as a Russian gangster and the owner of a restaurant called ''Koslov's Palace''. He was also planned to have a son named Morris.<ref>''The Art of Zootopia'', pages 16-17</ref>\n\nDespite his power, Koslov was not above the law. Like all predators, he was forced to wear an electric collar as a means to keep his will under the authority of prey citizens. This tied into a pivotal point in the story involving Koslov throwing a \"Taming Party\", where Morris turns 5, now eligible to be given an electric collar of his own. To Morris and the other children, this was a sign of maturity and the first step into adulthood; for Koslov, he regretted the day ever coming to pass, and such regret was validated when Morris, due to his joyous excitement, was shocked for the first time. A remorseful Koslov could only hug his son in response. The scene was meant to emphasize the cruelty predators faced in the original, dystopian draft of the story.<ref>''Imagining Zootopia''. Documentary, 2016</ref>\n\nIn a deleted scene, it is shown that Koslov was also a loan shark who finances [[Nick Wilde]]'s \"[[Wild Times]]\" theme park\u2014he was visited out of desperation, following the numerous rejections from other, professional bankers.\n\n==Role in the [[Zootopia|film]]==\nAfter being captured by some of [[Mr. Big (Zootopia)|Mr. Big]]'s henchmen, Raymond and Kevin, [[Nick Wilde]] (who Big holds a personal grudge against) and [[Judy Hopps]] are taken to the crime lord's lair. When Koslov appears, Judy believes him to be \"Mr. Big\", but after taking a seat at his desk, Koslov reveals Big to be an arctic shrew. He then stands in silence as a confrontation between Mr. Big and his visitors ensues (he is evidently sentimental at the mention of Mr. Big's deceased grandmother), and notably watches in a gruff physical pose as the latter pair are ordered to be iced. He later retains his calm demeanor once it is revealed that Judy saved the life of Big's daughter, [[Fru Fru]], the day prior.\n\nKoslov later appears standing behind the desk when Mr. Big and his polar bear henchmen interrogate [[Duke Weaselton]] for information.\n\nDuring the end credits, Koslov is seen enjoying the music of [[Gazelle]]'s concert with a stoic expression, while Mr. Big and Fru Fru dance together in his palms.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Concept art===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nZootopia_tundratown_concept.jpg\nKoslov concept by Cory Loftis(1).jpg\nKoslov concept by Cory Loftis(2).jpg\nKoslov concept by Nick Orsi.jpg\nKoslov and Morris concept .jpg\nKoslov and Nick Wilde concept art.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Promotional material===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nKozlov_Zootopia.png\nZootopia_Poster.jpg\nZootopia Japanese poster.jpg\nZootopia Film Poster 3.jpg\nZootopia Kevin poster.jpg\nKevin Zootopia Christmas Countdown.jpg\nZootropolis Underground Railway Promotion.jpg\nKoslov Transparent.png\n</gallery>\n\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nZootopia-40.png\nZot 226.jpg\nZot 227.jpg\nZootopia-disneyscreencaps.com-9809.jpg\nZootopia-disneyscreencaps.com-11483.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Merchandise and Miscellaneous===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nZootopia2.jpg\nZootopia directors, producer, and German cast.jpeg|Rich Moore, Byron Howard, Clark Spencer, and members of the ''Zootopia'' (known as ''Zoomania'' in Germany) German dub, surrounded by the main characters of the film.\nZootopia figures .jpg\nZootopia Funko Pops and Mystery Minis.jpg\nMr. Big & Koslov DHBM.png|In [[Disney Heroes: Battle Mode]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*On some promotional material, Koslov's name was incorrectly written as '''Kevin'''.\n*Koslov is shown to be Christian, as he is seen doing the sign of the cross in prayer during the film.\n*In some promotional materials, Koslov's sweater is colored blue\u2014this is because blue was the color of his suit in the earlier versions of the story, before ultimately being changed to black.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Zootopia}}\n[[ar:\u0643\u0648\u0632\u0644\u0648\u0641]]\n[[Category:Zootopia characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Bears]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Mobsters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney Heroes: Battle Mode characters]]"
