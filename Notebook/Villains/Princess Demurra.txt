She was \"kidnapped\" by [[King Draykor]], and her supposed lover [[Sir Brad Starlight]] set out to save her with the help of [[Wander]] and [[Sylvia]]. But it turned out that she and Draykor were in love and were planning to get married, and Brad was a former flame from their teen years. Despite having the appearance of a stereotypical fairytale princess, her personality is radically different, for she is a realist, as she explained to Brad one can't expect life to be like a fairytale and how real romance takes a lot of work and communication. She is also a very capable person, since she saved herself from the much larger Brad after he attempted to kidnap her from Draykor.\n\n== Appearances ==\n* \"[[The Hero]]\" (first appearance)\n* \"[[The Gift (Wander Over Yonder)|The Gift]]\" (cameo)\n* \"[[The Rager]]\"\n* \"[[The End of the Galaxy]]\"\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\ntumblr_n3or68yH5W1rvyrsao3_1280.jpg\ndemurra hostage.jpg\nDemurracapable.jpg\ndrakordemmurakids.jpg|Demurra, Drakor and their 2 daughters and son\n</gallery>\n\n{{Wander Over Yonder}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Demurra}}\n[[Category:Wander Over Yonder characters]]\n[[Category:Princesses]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
