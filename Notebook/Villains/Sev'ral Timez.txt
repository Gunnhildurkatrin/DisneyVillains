Its members are Greggy C, Creggy G, Leggy P, Chubby Z, and Deep Chris.\n\n==Background==\n===Physical appearance===\nBeing clones, all five boys have the exact same DNA and many physical features: blond hair, blue eyes, black eyebrows, muscular physiques, square chins, and light skin. Additionally, they all wear some sort of white top, lavender pants, and white shoes with gray soles. Differentiated features include the following:\n*Creggy wears an open vest, gold necklace with the initials \"ST,\" fingerless, pink gloves, and has a pink and white yin-yang tattoo. His hair is parted down the middle and sticks out on the sides.\n*Greggy's hair is slicked back and spiked, and he wears a long-sleeved shirt.\n*Leggy wears a tank top and a pink belt with a gold buckle, and he has slicked-back hair.\n*Chubby has curly hair (possibly a perm), a dark mustache and goatee, and wears a gold bead necklace, an open white jacket with pink lapels, and a white undershirt.\n*Chris wears a white fedora with a pink band, a ski jacket with a pink zipper, and gold rings on his right index and left middle fingers.\n[[File:S1e17 yo what up girl.png|thumb|left|The boys explore Dipper's and Mabel's bedroom.]]\n\n===Personality===\nThe boys are quite friendly toward others, except Ergman Bratzman, whom they fear and view as \"evil, mean, and reckless.\" Due to being raised as caged animals, their behavior can be rather animalistic, and they lack the knowledge of how to perform many basic tasks (e.g. eating and drinking) and what many common objects (e.g. trees, the sun, and tape) are for the same reason. In this respect, they retain curious natures. They are gullible, easily manipulated, chivalrous, enjoy each others' company, and occasionally burst into song at random times.\n\n==Role in the series==\nWhen the boys come to [[Gravity Falls (location)|Gravity Falls,]] [[Mabel Pines|Mabel]], [[Candy Chiu|Candy]], and [[Grenda]] are among the hundreds of fans who are excited about their concert. Unfortunately, the trio are unable to get in when the tickets are sold out, so Mabel suggests that the girls sneak in backstage to meet the members. Upon entering their dressing room, the girls are shocked to learn Sev'ral Timez are clones and decide to help them after learning of their desire to be free. Shortly after, they are sneaked into the Mystery Shack via a duffle bag.\n\n[[File:S1e17 band leaving.png|thumb|left|Mabel sets the band free.]]\nThere, the girls quickly bond with the band and proceed to engage in various activities together, whilst teaching the band how to function as normal humans and hiding them from their evil producer. Upon learning about Ergman's arrest, Candy and Grenda are eager to let the boys go and rush to deliver the good news, only to be stopped by Mabel, who has grown overly attached to the band in her boy craziness. She lies to the band members, saying that Ergman is still searching for them, and they'll probably have to stay with her forever, then has them toss out Candy and Grenda, and tells the band that the two are liars. However, when the band sings a [[Mabel Girl|song]] about how she was right about turning her back on her friends, Mabel eventually comes to regret her dishonesty and lets the boys go into the forest, where they begin their new lives.\n\nDuring \"[[Weirdmageddon (event)|Weirdmageddon]]\", the boys are part of the rebel group at the [[The Mystery Shack|Mystery Shack]]. They participate in the battle against [[Bill Cipher]]'s minions by running on a treadmill to power the Shacktron.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* There's a reference to the band's name in the ''[[Star vs. the Forces of Evil]]'' episode [[Into the Wand]].\n{{GFWiki}}\n{{Gravity Falls}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Timez, Sev'ral}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Gravity Falls characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Mutants]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]"
