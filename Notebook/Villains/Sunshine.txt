Despite being a toon stork, Sunshine is considerably good-hearted, but optimistic for one, showing most regard for the infants he is supposed to care for, and even brave and heroic towards other toons (including rescuing Roger from a helicopter at the end).\n==='''Appearance'''===\nHe is a slender, anthropomorphic toon stork who has white feathers, green eyes, and wears a blue turtle-necked vest with a blue hat in his head.\n\n==Role in the story==\nWhen Sunshine was laying down quietly to the street all tied up in ropes, he tells [[Jessica Rabbit|Jessica]] that he is a toon and she wouldn't hurt him. But, Jessica halts her car and asks, \"Another stork?\", and unties him. As Sunshine says there's a toon-napping (which means delivering a rhino named Ryan O. Rhino by mistake) and he was supposed to deliver a male human/toon baby to Jessica at 8:00 p.m. tonight, he explains to her in a flashback with his rival and competitor, [[Nightwing]] from the Nightwing Infant Placement Company. \n\nAfter Sunshine sees [[Rick Flint]] getting kicked in the face by Nightwing and kidnapping Jessica as his \"premium\" to the Nocturnal Air Freight Company, back in Toontown, [[Roger Rabbit]] explains to him that the rhino they take back was supposed to be theirs. And however, Sunshine explains to him that how he know they'd been set up again and his company doesn't handle rhinos.\n\nBack at the Nocturnal Air Freight Company at night, Roger, Rick and the human baby get on Sunshine's back and rescue Ryan O. Rhino with Jessica holding him. Also, after she says that something tells her that Roger have had enough of chasing after babies for a while, Sunshine flies to the helicopter to rescue Roger and the human baby from the helicopter.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Sunshine is one of the two storks that was inspired by [[Mr. Stork]] from ''[[Dumbo]]''.\n{{Who Framed Roger Rabbit}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Who Framed Roger Rabbit characters]]\n[[Category:Storks]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]"
