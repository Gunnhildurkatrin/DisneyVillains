Once Pupert had a crush on a girl called Lucy. He wrote a song to her, that [[Maggie Pesky|Maggie]] performed in front of whole Stickyfeet. He is voiced by [[Thom Adcox-Hernandez]].\n\n==Personality==\nMaggie and [[Aldrin Pesky|Aldrin]]'s six-year-old brother is nothing short of an average child. He is clumsy, loves to have fun with Maggie, and takes great pride in the small tasks he accomplishes. He is an expert at photography and tattling and has a big sweet tooth. Unlike Aldrin and Maggie, Pupert isn't selfish. He thinks about others and their wants instead of himself and his needs.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Maggie Pesky===\nPupert and Maggie is most like friends, but Maggie is using him in a few situations for her selfish interests. Pupert sometimes sabotages for Maggie, but not on purpose.\n\n===Aldrin Pesky===\nAldrin wants Pupert in his team when he wants to do something against Maggie. But otherwise, Aldrin is teasing Pupert.\n\n===Lucy===\nPupert had a crush on Lucy in \"The Price of Fame\". In the end, they went steady. Lucy made cameos in other episodes, but it's not confirmed if they are still together.\n\n===[[Chauncey Pesky|Chauncey]] and [[Frieda Pesky]]===\nPupert's relation to his parents is great. Because of Pupert's kindness, and that he is not selfish, they never punish him. Most because that he never does anything bad.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nPupert2.png\nChar_39160.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Buzz on Maggie}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pesky Pupert}}\n[[Category:The Buzz on Maggie characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Flies]]\n[[Category:Insects]]"
