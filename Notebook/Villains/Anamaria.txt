She is a pirate and a crew member of the ''[[HMS Interceptor]]'' under [[Jack Sparrow|Captain Jack Sparrow]]'s command, during the attempt to rescue [[Elizabeth Swann]] from Captain [[Hector Barbossa]] on [[Isla de Muerta]].\n\n==Role in the film==\nAnamaria had sailed with Jack Sparrow prior to this, but the pirate captain had stolen her boat, the [[Jolly Mon]] - or, as Sparrow himself put it, \"borrowed without permission, but with every intention of bringing it back\", though he never did, as the Jolly Mon sank at the [[Port Royal]] harbor moments after Jack disembarked on the dock.\n\nThis deed was not forgotten by Anamaria, who made a point of reminding Jack of his transgression when they met again in Tortuga. Unlike other misdeeds Jack has done with women, Jack felt he deserved that slap. In an attempt to placate her, and ensure she would join his crew, Jack promised to give her another vessel, which, due to [[Will Turner]]'s intervention, he was forced to concede would be the Interceptor.\n\nIndeed, Anamaria steered the ship after Turner rescued Elizabeth, since Jack had fallen behind during the rescue on Isla de Muerta. She was able to outrun the [[Black Pearl]] for a time, and engaged its cursed pirates in combat when Barbossa's ship caught up. The crew were ultimately captured and the Interceptor destroyed, and soon after Anamaria and the others found themselves locked in the brig of the Black Pearl.\n\nWhen the ship returned to Isla de Muerta, Elizabeth infiltrated the Pearl and rescued Jack's crew, hoping they would help her rescue Will. However, the pirates, recalling Jack owed them a ship, decided to take the Black Pearl instead. Sometime later, during the planned hanging of Jack Sparrow, Anamaria steered the Black Pearl to [[Port Royal]], where it awaited Jack's escape. With the help of [[Will Turner]], Jack evaded the noose, and fell over the fort. The Pearl rounded the cove, and Jack was brought on board. Anamaria handed over command of the ship to Jack, content to serve simply as one of his crew.\n\nSince Anamaria was not seen in the POTC sequels, it can be assumed she and Jack parted ways and Jack got her another ship. Or she was one of the pirates who's bones the [[Pelegostos Tribe]] made cages from.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Her absence in the sequel films is a result of actress [[Zoe Saldana]] having been badly affected by the overly hot, bright and sometimes harsh conditions of shooting in the Caribbean. Following the first film, she refused to sign back on.\n**Additionally in the non-canonical ''[[LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean: The Video Game]]'', Anamaria appeared in the \"''Dead Man's Chest''\" and \"''At World's End''\" campaigns in the game itself, whereas in the actual films themselves, she is absent in both of these aforementioned sequels.\n*At the end of ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'', the actors were told Anamaria would be walking down the stairs, their surprised reactions when they saw Geoffrey Rush as [[Hector Barbossa]] was genuine.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nAnamaria.png\nAnamaria 2.jpg\npirates1-disneyscreencaps.com-7399.jpg\npirates1-disneyscreencaps.com-7437.jpg\npirates1-disneyscreencaps.com-7442.jpg\npirates1-disneyscreencaps.com-15824.jpg\npirates1-disneyscreencaps.com-15838.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*[http://pirates.fandom.com/wiki/Anamaria Anamaria] on [http://pirates.fandom.com/wiki Pirates of the Caribbean Wiki].\n\n{{Pirates of the Caribbean}}\n[[Category:Pirates of the Caribbean characters]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Sailors]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]"
