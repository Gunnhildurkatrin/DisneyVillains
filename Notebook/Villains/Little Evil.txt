I wanna be just as Evil as you are, Popsie!|Little Evil to his [[Manta|father]]}}\n'''Little Evil''' is a minor character in the television series [[The Little Mermaid (TV series)|''The Little Mermaid'']]. He is the son of [[Manta]], who is a recurring villain in the series.\n\n==Background==\nLittle Evil is the only son of Evil Manta, and appears as a humanoid manta ray. His mother is not identified; Little Evil's existence was not alluded to until his debut, causing confusion among fans as to the circumstances of his birth.\n\nEvil Manta desires to raise Little Evil as a villain, often encouraging the boy to act bratty, evil and demanding. Early on, Little Evil expressed a desire to be like his evil father. After encountering [[Ariel]], however, Little Evil ultimately proved to be good at heart with a natural sense of curiosity. He develops a love of art and a desire to attend school with other Atlanticans.\n\nLike his father, Little Evil has undefined magical abilities. The only one seen in depth is his ability to generate blasts of electricity from his tail, which can stun people. Later on, with help from Ariel, he is able to develop a technique for carving into stone and rock using low voltage blasts from his tail.\n\n==Role in the series==\n===\"[[A Little Evil]]\"===\nLittle Evil debuted in the episode \"[[A Little Evil]]\" which was the last episode in the series. Little Evil is shown to be the son of Evil Manta, whom Evil Manta desires to raise in villainy. However, Little Evil encounters [[Ariel]]. Despite the boy's heritage, Ariel comes to believe that there is good in him and introduces Little Evil to school and art. Evil Manta grows angered at this, and attempts to attack Ariel. However, the tables are turned when Evil Manta is targeted by his own creature, a [[Brain Sponge|brain-sucking monster]]. Ariel and Little Evil are able to save Evil Manta, who apparently reforms, and allows Little Evil to attend school, if somewhat reluctantly.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n{{The Little Mermaid}}\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:The Little Mermaid characters]]\n[[Category:Artists]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Fish]]\n[[Category:Marine Animals]]\n[[Category:Sea Monsters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
