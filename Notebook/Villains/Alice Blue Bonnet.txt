She is eventually bought and is shown to be very sad as she is placed in a hatbox and taken away from Johnny. Later, while her owner is walking through town,\u00a0she sees Johnny who has been sold himself but they\u00a0can't get to each other.\u00a0However, she eventually ends up in the possession of an iceman who cuts two holes in her rim and places her over one of his horse's ears. To her joy, Johnny is found by the same iceman shortly thereafter and placed on the head of his other horse. Thus, they are reunited and go on to be together ever after.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Animation===\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nAkice Blue Bonnet.jpg\nalice_8.jpg\nalice.jphjks.jpg|Alice smiling at Johnny\nMakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps com-4311.jpg|Johnny and Alice's first kiss at the store\nMakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps com-4329.jpg|Johnny and Alice's dream about their future baby bonnets\nMakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps.com-4360.jpg|Alice being bought by a woman\nTumblr_lz740urtXD1r3jmn6o1_1280.png|Alice being placed inside a hatbox\nMakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps com-4409.jpg|Johnny watching Alice being taken away\n42208.jpg|Alice being carried into the woman's carriage\nMakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps.com-4438.jpg|Alice waving goodbye to Johnny from inside the carriage\nMakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps com-4988.jpg|Johnny and Alice kissing again in the horses' stable\nalice_blue_.jpg\n</gallery>\n===Printed Media===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\" bordercolor=\"transparent\">\nalice_1.jpg\nJohnnyFedora&AliceBluebonnetStorybook (1).jpg|Johnny and Alice in the Disneyland Read-Along Storybook\nJohnnyFedora&amp;AliceBluebonnetStorybook (3).jpg\nMakeMineMusicPoster (2).jpg\nMakeMineMusicPoster.jpg\nJohnnyFedora&AliceBluebonnetLobbyCard.jpg|Alice and Johnny on a lobby card for ''Make Mine Music''\n</gallery>\n===Merchandise and Miscellaneous===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\" bordercolor=\"transparent\">\nalice_blue.jpg|A pin of Alice and Johnny\nDisney-Mix6.jpeg\nClub11.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Blue Bonnet, Alice}}\n\n{{Make Mine Music}}\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Make Mine Music characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Articles of Clothing]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse (TV series) characters]]"
