Though he does help, being the stretchiest animal in the [[Central Park Zoo|zoo]], and his elongated body can be used as a variety of things. He is used as a slingshot during the curling championship when Samson is about to fling his turtle curling iron across the ice rink, but slips. Larry is also used as a prop when he and the other animals become trapped inside a garbage disposal truck. Samson uses Larry to hold the trash compressor open, but it fails. Larry then frightens the truck driver, and the animals manage to escape. Larry is almost killed as a pack of rabid stray dogs tried to attack the snake, so Samson make him along with the other two escape through the sewer rather than fight. He accompanies\u00a0Samson during [[Ryan]]'s rescue\u00a0and gives Ryan a choking hug upon finding him.\u00a0Larry is last seen on the boat\u00a0wearing a fruit hat and makeup done by\u00a0Cloak and Camo as a \"snake-over\", and dances with his zoo friends\u00a0as they\u00a0head back home.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Larry\u00a0is the\u00a0second Disney snake character who is a protagonist, the first being [[Murgatroid]] from ''[[The Brave Little Toaster to the Rescue]]'', the third being [[Juju]] from ''[[The Princess and the Frog]]''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\n00000982.jpg|Larry on the theatrical teaser poster\nLarry the Anaconda.png\n2006 the wild 031.jpg|Larry being used as a slingshot for the curling championship\n2006 the wild 015.jpg|Larry huddling with Nigel, Samson, Bridget and Benny\nThe-wild-disneyscreencaps.com-1133.png\nFile:The-wild-disneyscreencaps.com-2525.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Wild}}\n[[Category:The Wild characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Snakes]]\n[[Category:Zoo Animals]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]"
