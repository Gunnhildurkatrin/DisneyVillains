They were voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]] and [[Corey Burton]] respectively.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nSigmund and Lloyd can be rather sarcastic toward each other when they are first seen, but then they have a good heart when they reunite.\n\n===Physical Attributes===\nSigmund and Lloyd both have hair styles that are in a style of gel. Sigmund has blond hair and wears a red shirt and darker red pants while Lloyd has brown hair and wears a blue shirt, a blue vest, a blue belt, and darker blue pants.\n\n==Role in series==\nWhile [[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]] are walking in Las Vegas, Nevada, they find a seafood restaurant and see lobsters, which they mistake for bugs, through the window. They walk in the restaurant but then get thrown out since they don't have any money. The two then see that there is a show that involves two white lions named [[Heimlich and Schnitzel]] and their trainers, Sigmund and Lloyd. Timon suggests that he and Pumbaa join the show so that they can make money for the seafood restaurant.\n\nWhen Timon and Pumbaa enter the show, they see Heimlich and Schnitzel sitting in their cage and then see Sigmund and Lloyd arguing and breaking up. So Timon decides to run the show himself. He and Pumbaa enter the cage and the show begins.\n\nLater, Pumbaa, who was at first afraid of Heimlich and Schnitzel since lions eat warthogs, enjoys the lions' performance while Timon is frightened by their harsh behaviors. The meerkat sees Sigmund and Lloyd sitting on separate tables from each other refusing to talk to each other. Pumbaa then has an idea for a television special and the two men reunite and decide to run the show again. Though, on Heimlich and Schnitzel's condition, Sigmund and Lloyd get tormented by the lions.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The duo are a play on the late {{WikipediaLink|Siegfried & Roy}}, two contemporary magician entertainers who became well known for training big cats.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nSigmund.png|Sigmund\nDhtvi lloyd.png|Lloyd\ndhtvi.png\nsigmund and lloyd2.png\nsigmund and lloyd3.png\nsigmund and lloyd4.png\nlloyd2.png\nsigmund2.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{TheLionKingWiki}}\n{{The Lion King}}\n[[Category:Timon & Pumbaa characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Circus performers]]\n[[Category:German characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]"
