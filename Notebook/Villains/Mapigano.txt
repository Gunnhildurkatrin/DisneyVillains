He orders Badili not to come back and forces Badili to flee to the [[Pride Lands]].\n\nBadili, after being urged by the [[Lion Guard]] to return home, is confronted by Mapigano who says that Mirihi Forest isn't his turf anymore and orders him to get out. However, the Lion Guard had caught up with Badili and force Mapigano to leave.\n\nThe next day, Mapigano returns to Mirihi Forest and forces Badili out again and he returns to the Pride Lands, where the Lion Guard realize that only Badili himself can get rid of Mapigano for good.\n\nAfter being trained by the Lion Guard to be confident, Badili returns to Mirihi Forest and confronts Mapigano, who at first laughs at Badili's attempts of bravery and attacks. However, Badili stands up for himself and roars, causing Mapigano to flee Mirihi Forest for good.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nMapigano 07.png\nMapigano 11.png|Badili intimidates Mapigano\nMapigano 21.png\nMapigano 53.png\nThe-trouble-with-galagos_(204).png|Mapigano intimidates Badili\nThe-trouble-with-galagos_(212).png\nThe-trouble-with-galagos_(225).png\nThe-trouble-with-galagos_(232).png\nThe-trouble-with-galagos_(252).png\nThe-trouble-with-galagos_(413).png|Slumbering Mapigano\nThe-trouble-with-galagos_(430).png\nThe-trouble-with-galagos_(455).png\nThe-trouble-with-galagos_(462).png\nThe-trouble-with-galagos_(464).png\nThe-trouble-with-galagos_(482).png\nThe Trouble With Galagos 25.png|Mapigano gets roared at by Badili\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Lion King}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:The Lion Guard characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Leopards and cheetahs]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Hunters]]\n[[Category:African characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
