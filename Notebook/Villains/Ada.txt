"{{Infobox character\n|name = Ada\n|image = Ada.png\n|shows = ''[[Tron: Uprising]]''\n|voice = [[Parminder Nagra]]\n|occupation = [[ISO]]|status=Active}}\n\n'''Ada''' is a character in ''[[Tron: Uprising]]''. She is a female [[ISO]], and a friend of [[Quorra]].\n\n==Biography==\nFollowing the Purge, a few ISOs managed to escape their genocide and survived as fugitives. Ada and Quorra had been on the run for some time when Ada was critically injured and rendered unconscious. A group of other programs had surrounded the pair when [[Paige]] chanced upon the scene and helped the ISOs escape. Paige nursed Ada back to health, but her friends betrayed the fugitives, forcing Ada and Quorra to flee once more.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Ada speaks with a light accent, similar to an Australian one; to date, this accent has been heard only from her.\u00a0\n*It is likely that her name was taken from Ada Lovelace, whom some consider the first computer programmer.\u00a0\n*In \"[[ElecTRONica]]\", a program named Ada stood in for Eckert on one occasion. However, she resembled Eckert and did not appear related to Quorra's friend.\u00a0\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nSn tron uprising quorra-1-.jpg|<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Ada with [[Quorra]].</div>\n</gallery>\n\n{{TronWiki}}\n{{Tron}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Programs]]\n[[Category:Tron characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Tron: Uprising characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
