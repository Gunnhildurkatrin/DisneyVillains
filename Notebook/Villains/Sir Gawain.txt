He is [[Cavin]]'s grandfather, a retired knight of [[Dunwyn Castle]], and a strong believer in [[Gummi Bears]].\n\nNothing is known about whether he is Cavin's paternal or maternal grandfather, as neither of the boy's parents are ever shown on-screen, or even mentioned throughout the series.\n\nHe is the one who gave Cavin his own good-luck-charm, the [[Gummi Bear Medallion]] that he found as a youth while exploring the Northern Mountains, near [[Ursalia]]. The medallion later lands in the possession of [[Zummi Gummi]], a fact that Cavin initially covers up by falsely admitting to losing the artifact in order to honor his promise to the Gummies to keep their secret.\n\nSir Gawain later meets the Gummi Bears himself, and becomes aware of the whereabouts of his old medallion, though he remains unaware of his grandson's direct acquaintance with the fabled bears.\n\n==Appearances==\nHe only has two appearances in the series; once in the second season, and once in the fourth season:\n*\"[[Over the River and Through the Trolls]]\"\n*\"[[He Who Laughs Last]]\"\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=180 spacing=small position=center captionalign=center hideaddbutton=true>\nScreen Shot 2014-09-03 at 7.49.19 pm.png|Gawain when he was Cavin's age..\nScreen Shot 2014-09-03 at 7.50.30 pm.png|...exploring the mountainous area...\nSir Gawain First Found the Medallion.jpg|...where he found the Gummi Bear Medallion\ngrand_3.jpg|Gawain in young adulthood\ngrand_2.jpg|Sir Gawain at his current age...\nAdventuresOfTheGummiBears-CavinReceivesTheGummiBearMedallion.png|...giving the Gummi Medallion to his grandson\nScreen Shot 2014-09-04 at 6.32.12 am.png|Sir Gawain meeting Zummi\nScreen Shot 2014-09-04 at 6.24.42 am.png\nE22 04.jpg\ne22_14.jpg\ne22_47.jpg\ne22_61.jpg\ne22_71.jpg\ne22_72.jpg\ne22_123.jpg|Sir Gawain at [[Gummi Glen|the Gummi Bears' home]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*His name comes from {{WikipediaLink|Gawain}}, a knight of the Round Table, and member of [[Arthur Pendragon|King Arthur]]'s court.\n*Sir Gawain is one of a relatively small group of humans who find out about the existence of Gummi Bears during the course of the series. Other humans that become explicitly aware of the bears, are [[Cavin]], [[Princess Calla]], [[Duke Igthorn]], [[Lady Bane]], [[Princess Marie]], [[Angelo Davini]], [[Flint Shrubwood]], [[The Hunter|the Hunter]], [[Rotocelli]], [[Doctor Dexter]], [[Marzipan]], [[Lord Willoughby]], [[Prince Yen Moon]] and his subjects, Carney's assistant from the episode \"[[Never Give a Gummi an Even Break]]\", and the boy who turned himself into a Giant, from the episode \"[[When You Wish Upon a Stone]]\".\n\n{{Adventures of the Gummi Bears}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gawain, Sir}}\n[[Category:Adventures of the Gummi Bears characters]]\n[[Category:Grandparents]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Knights]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:English characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]"
