Females are referred to as '''mermaids''', while males are referred to as '''mermen'''.\n\nThey are featured most heavily in ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'', and [[The Little Mermaid (TV series)|other]] [[The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea|related]] [[The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning|media]]. Other than ''The Little Mermaid'' franchise, they have made appearances in other films and shows.\n\n==Background==\n===Mythology===\nThe earliest records of merpeople were the \"fish people\" created by the goddess {{WikipediaLink|Tiamat}} in the Babylonian Creation Epic the ''Enuma Elish'', written on clay tablets several thousand years ago. They appear in the folklore of many cultures worldwide, sometimes associated with perilous events such as floods, storms, shipwrecks, and drownings. In other folk traditions, they can be benevolent or beneficent, bestowing boons or falling in love with humans. Some attributes of mermaids borrow influence from other mythological creatures, including the Sirens and [[Naiads]] of Greek mythology. In many stories, mermaids and mermen lure and attract humans with their enchantingly beautiful and melodic voices to send the humans to their demise or simply entertain them.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nMerpeople possess the traits of both humans and fish: their upper body is generally depicted as human or humanoid, while a fishtail replaces the lower body. Merpeople are also shown to be fairly tall, with [[King Triton]] towering over most of them, and even [[Ariel]] in her human form is only a few inches shorter than [[Prince Eric|Eric]].\n\n==Powers and Abilities==\n*'''Underwater Breathing''': In order to live underwater, merpeople have the ability to metabolize oxygen from the water, which negates the need to surface to breathe air. However, they are more than capable of breathing air outside of the water, as evidenced by certain events where they are on land for prolonged periods of time.\n*'''Aquapathy''': They have a connection to their aquatic home, as they can communicate with aquatic and marine life.\n*'''Speed Swimming''': They can swim for days without exhaustion as well jump over the water like dolphins, in such speed and agility as to rival or surpass most aquatic creatures.\n*'''Super Strength''': Merpeople are often depicted with a degree of superhuman strength and abilities, which is evidenced by [[Ariel]] moving an underwater boulder from the grotto as well as knocking down a door with relative ease.\n*'''Aquakinesis''': They can control, shape, and manipulate water at will.\n*'''Thermoendurance''': They have the ability to endure any temperature in water.\n\n== Appearances ==\n=== Animated appearances ===\n==== ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' franchise ====\n[[File:Little-mermaid-1080p-disneyscreencaps.com-9101.jpg|thumb|250px]]\nIn ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' and related media, merpeople are shown to live in the sea within various underwater kingdoms. [[Atlantica]] is the most prominent, though others are implied to exist in the [[The Little Mermaid (TV series)|TV series]]. They are shown to coexist with sea life, with whom they are able to communicate. They generally do not interact with humans, due to the danger, though this changes after the events of the first film. It also shows that many unnamed ones are held as prisoners of [[Ursula]]. They made bargains for her aid and were unable to uphold their part of it. As a result, they are withered down to [[Ursula's Garden|polyps]]. Ursula's death causes them to be restored to their natural forms.\n\nInterestingly, dialogue from one fish character in the TV series implies that most fish either don't realize or don't know that merpeople have parts of their biology that resemble that of a human, as it refers to them as \"half-fish, half-something else\". Mermen generally appear bare-chested, but females usually wear a pair of seashell bikini top out of decency. It is also possible that they are herbivores, or at the very least vegetarians, as they aren't seen eating fish, and apparently they don't seem to view doing so as being ethical.\n\n==== ''[[Gravity Falls]]'' ====\n[[File:S1e15 mabel being rude.png|thumb|left|250px]]\nMerpeople were briefly mentioned in \"[[Dipper vs. Manliness]]\" by the [[Manotaurs]], and a merman named \"[[Mermando]]\" appears in \"[[The Deep End]]\". They are stated to live in the water. What may be a skeleton of one can be seen in the [[Mystery Shack|Mystery Shack gift shop]], although it resembles the famous hoax {{WikipediaLink|Fiji Mermaid}}. In the [[Gravity Falls Title Theme|opening credits]], a picture of one like the one in the Mystery Shack can be seen at the end of the credits. They also appear in the episode \"[[The Deep End]]\" when [[Mabel Pines]] befriends a beautiful merman named Mermando. He had been swimming in the Gulf of Mexico but was caught by a net from a fisherman. He later is seen at the [[Gravity Falls Pool]]. When she first saw him, she went all silly, wanting him. She soon realizes that he is a merman, and thus tries to help him, of which she succeeds. He is last seen swimming back to his home. Merpeople have about 17 hearts.\n\n==== ''[[American Dragon: Jake Long]]'' ====\nMerpeople are among the magical creatures featured in ''American Dragon: Jake Long''. Two notable merpeople are [[Silver]] and [[Dolores Derceto]].\n\n==== ''[[Sofia the First]]'' ====\nIn the special ''[[Sofia the First: The Floating Palace]]'', [[Sofia the First (character)|Sofia]] and her family visit [[Merroway Cove (location)|Merroway Cove]] for a vacation and discovers an undersea kingdom homed to merpeople and makes friends with a mermaid named [[Oona]]. Ariel makes a special guest appearance. Thanks to Oona's help, Sofia can now turn into a mermaid using the [[Amulet of Avalor]]. Sofia turns into a mermaid again in ''[[Cool Hand Fluke]]'' and her mermaid friends also appear as well.\n\n==== ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'' ====\nIn the episode ''[[One Good Turn]]'' a mermaid resembling [[Lyla Lolliberry]] appears during the song \"''Humiliating Stumblegimp Dance of Contrition\"''.\n\n==== ''[[Star vs. the Forces of Evil]]'' ====\nAccording to [[Mewni]] royalty law, a Princess cannot become queen if she cuts off a Mermaid's tail. [[Star Butterfly|Star]] was going to cut off a Mermaid tail when [[Marco Diaz|Marco]] stopped her from doing it. But instead, Star throws the axes into the Mermaid's tank, shatters the glass, and it ran out with the water.\n\n==== ''[[Penn Zero: Part-Time Hero]]'' ====\nIn the episode ''[[Chicken or Fish?]]'', [[Penn Zero|Penn]] takes on the appearance of a prince merman of the underwater city of Oceanaquariopolis. He took the two mermaids that are actually mermen. In the episode ''[[Fish and Chips]]'', While their finding Rufus and discover Oceanaquariopolis is in a fish tank at a restaurant. In the episode ''[[Save the Worlds]]'', When Oceanaquariopolis the vortexes.\n\n==== ''[[Pickle and Peanut]]'' ====\nIn the episode \"[[Fishy Biz]]\", [[Pickle]] and [[Peanut]] sneak into the aquarium during closing time. They discover that Sadie, the woman who works at the aquarium's information kiosk, turns out to be a mermaid. While Pickle takes Sadie out on a date, Peanut fills in for her.\n\n==== ''[[Elena of Avalor]]'' ====\nIn the episode ''[[Song of the Sirenas]]'', [[Princess Marisa]] and [[Prince Marzel]].\n\n==== ''[[Tangled: The Series]]'' ====\nIn the episode ''[[There's Something About Hook Foot]]'', while [[Rapunzel]] and her friends are stranded on [[Terapi Island]], [[Hook Foot]] falls in love with a mermaid named [[Seraphina (Tangled)|Seraphina]].\n\n==== ''[[DuckTales (2017 series)|DuckTales]]'' reboot ====\nIn the episode ''[[The Lost Harp of Mervana!]]'', merpeople are portrayed as half duck and half fish creatures who live in the society of Mervana, known as Mervanans. Their leader in this episode is Honestus, who ruled over the residents of Mervana, but due to his ignorance and refusal, he is transformed into a monstrous fish (the same one the Duck family encountered). Taking the Magic Harp back to them, the merpeople fight off a cursed Honestus to which after a fierce battle, the king of the merpeople is transformed back into his normal self as the merpeople of Mervana and the Harp rebuild their kingdom.\n\n=== ''[[Mickey Mouse Funhouse]]'' ===\nIn the episode ''[[Goldfish Goofy!]]'',\n\n=== Live-action appearances ===\n==== ''[[Splash]]'' ====\nIn [[1984]], Disney released a live-action romantic comedy under the [[Touchstone Films|Touchstone]] label which was centered around a mermaid, played by [[Daryl Hannah]]. Taking the name [[Madison]] (and thus inspiring a great many real-world girls to do the same), she leaves the sea to seek out her beloved (played by [[Tom Hanks]]), whom she rescued from drowning. However, marine biologist Dr. Walter Kornbluth is convinced that mermaids are real, and will stop at nothing to protect his credibility by exposing her to the world.\n\n==== ''[[The Thirteenth Year]]'' ====\nIn ''[[The Thirteenth Year]]'', two merpeople are shown: the protagonist, Cody, and his biological mother. The ones in this film are somewhat similar in appearance to one from other media. However, there are several distinctions. They are able to pass for humans until they turn 13 when the fish physiology surfaces. The transformation is shown to be triggered by exposure to water. In addition to the fish-like tail, they also have scales on their palms and small fins that run along their forearms. They also seem to possess other abilities, such as the one to generate electricity, to the point that they can fire it similarly to a defibrillator, and the one to stick to surfaces.\n\n==== ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'' ====\nIn ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'', mermaids are depicted with brown-black hair, tan skin, and silvery fishtails with pink fins. They are seen near the end of the film swimming, leaping, diving, and laughing in merriment near the shores of Cair Paravel.\n\n==== ''[[Once Upon a Time]]'' ====\n[[File:Once Upon a Time - 3x06 - Ariel - Meeting.jpg|thumb|250px]]\nMermaids are a humanoid species featured on ABC's ''Once Upon a Time'', notable for having the ability to swim across realms. They are native to the [[Enchanted Forest]] and [[Neverland]] and first appear in the first episode of the third season. They are described as the most dangerous creatures in all the seas and are considered more of a threat than sharks, whales, or even a Kraken. Their powerful tails can break through wood and in large swarms they can sink ships. Mermaids can also use shells as trumpets to summon and manipulate terrible storms and waves. Some mermaids have voices which are lovely enough to enchant people and lure them onto rocks. Only four mermaids have been shown on the show, one being [[Ariel]], [[Ursula]] before becoming the Sea Witch, another unnamed one, and an alternative version of Ariel from the Wish Dimension. Snow White also briefly turned into a mermaid.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nTumblr nq3warcmYP1r3jmn6o1 1280.png|Goofy with Mermaids in ''[[How to Swim]]''\nPeter-pan-disneyscreencaps.com-4242.jpg|[[Mermaids (Peter Pan)|Mermaids]] in [[Mermaid Lagoon (Peter Pan)|Mermaid Lagoon]] ([[Peter Pan (film)|Peter Pan]])\nLittlemermaid 026.jpg|Merpeople in ''[[The Little Mermaid]]''\nariels041.jpg|Merpeople in ''[[The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning]]''\nLittle-mermaid-1080p-disneyscreencaps.com-555.jpg|[[King Triton's Daughters]]\nAriel-1.png|[[Ariel]]\nUrchin Render.png|[[Urchin]]\nWishuponastarfish79.jpg|[[Gabriella]] with [[Ollie (The Little Mermaid)|Ollie]]\nUntitled 275.jpg|[[Pearl (The Little Mermaid)|Pearl]]\nLittle-mermaid2-disneyscreencaps.com-3720.jpg|[[Melody]]\nTriton.png|[[King Triton]]\nLittle-mermaid3-disneyscreencaps.com-390.jpg|[[Queen Athena]]\nMarinapic.png|[[Marina Del Rey]]\ns1e15 mermando.png|[[Mermando]]\nS1e15 swimming with mighty dolphins.png|Mermando among dolphins\nSora (Merman Form) (Art).png|[[Sora]] as a dolphin Merman\nPenn Merman.png|[[Penn Zero]] as the Prince of Oceanaquariopolis\nStormyjatnlp.png|[[Stormy]]\nA113356.PNG|A mermaid resembling [[Lyla Lolliberry]]\nSilver 2.jpg|[[Silver]]\nDecerto7.png|[[Dolores Derceto]]\nAquarianne.png|[[Aquarianne]] (''[[Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]'')\nSofia's Mermaid Form 1.png|Sofia as a Mermaid\nEmmaline.png|[[Queen Emmaline]]\nMermaid Oona.png|[[Oona]]\nCora Pose.png|[[Cora]]\nNerissa.JPG|[[Nerissa]]\nHaakon.png|[[Plank]]\nnarnia1-disneyscreencaps.com-13794.jpg|Mermaids in ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]''\nStar apologizes to her mermaid friend.png|A mermaid in ''[[Star vs. the Forces of Evil]]''\nS3E3 Ludo laughing with mermaids and half-fish.png|[[Ludo]] with merpeoples\nFishy Biz.png|[[Pickle]] and [[Peanut]] discover that Sadie is a mermaid\nThere's Something About Hook Foot 1.png|[[Seraphina (Tangled)|Seraphina]] in ''[[Tangled: The Series]]''\nSong of the Sirenas 2.png|[[Princess Marisa]], [[King Pescoro]], [[Queen Camila]], and [[Prince Marzel]] (Sirenas)\nMadison.jpg|[[Madison]]\nAlex TLM II.jpg|[[Alex]]\nStevie-1.png|[[Stevie]]\nDuckTales - Season 3 Sneak Peek!

This has some basis in various real-life myths on Merpeople, with the original Hans Christian Andersen tale indicating that merpeople were capable of living for three centuries.\n*In real life, the classification of merpeople is debatable due to possessing fish-like traits (namely fish-tails). However, the presence of mammary glands implies that they are mammals. In addition, their tails are patterned in a horizontal manner, more akin to marine mammals than true fish, whose fishtails are patterned vertically.\n*A common claim was that merpeople were actually manatees or dugongs that were surfacing and had seaweed on top, causing them to be mistaken for them. The first part of the Disney Comics story \"Serpent-Teen\" alludes to this claim by having a manatee named Eddie pose as Ariel, implying that they have frequently used manatees as decoys to ensure they weren't discovered.\n*The [[Aladdin (TV series)|TV series]] adaptation of the film ''[[Aladdin (1992 film)|Aladdin]]'' features a siren water elemental named [[Saleen]], which is similar to a mermaid. However, her fish features resemble that of a lionfish, and she possesses the power to manipulate water.\n*[[Miss Piggy]] appears as a mermaid while she, Kermit and Robin performed \"Octopus' Garden\" in the episode of ''The Muppet Show'' James Coco hosted.\n\n==External links==\n*{{WP|Merfolk}}\n*[[w:c:non-aliencreatures:Mermaid|Mermaid at Non-Alien Creatures Wiki]]\n*{{OUAT|Mermaids|Mermaids}}\n\n{{The Little Mermaid}}\n{{Peter Pan}}\n{{The Chronicles of Narnia}}\n{{Sofia the First}}\n{{American Dragon: Jake Long}}\n{{Phineas and Ferb}}\n{{Gravity Falls}}\n{{Star vs. the Forces of Evil}}\n{{Adventures of the Gummi Bears}}\n{{Once Upon a Time}}\n{{Penn Zero: Part-Time Hero}}\n{{Pickle and Peanut}}\n{{Elena of Avalor}}\n{{DuckTales}}\n{{Mickey Mouse Funhouse}}\n[[Category:The Little Mermaid characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Gravity Falls characters]]\n[[Category:Mermaids]]\n[[Category:American Dragon: Jake Long characters]]\n[[Category:Penn Zero: Part-Time Hero characters]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]\n[[Category:Once Upon a Time characters]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts characters]]\n[[Category:Sofia the First characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Mermen]]\n[[Category:The Chronicles of Narnia characters]]\n[[Category:Hybrids]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Adventures of the Gummi Bears characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Star vs. the Forces of Evil characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Pickle and Peanut characters]]\n[[Category:Tangled characters]]\n[[Category:Elena of Avalor characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Touchstone characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Descendants characters]]\n[[Category:DuckTales characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:The Thirteenth Year characters]]\n[[Category:Dumbo characters]]\n[[Category:Silly Symphonies characters]]\n[[Category:Pair of Kings characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Aladdin characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Sorcerer's Arena Characters]]\n[[Category:Scandinavian characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse Funhouse characters]]\n[[Category:Phineas and Ferb characters]]"
