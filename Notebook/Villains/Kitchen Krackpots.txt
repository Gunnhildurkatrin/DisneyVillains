"{{Infobox character\n|name = Kitchen Krackpots\n|image = Kitchenkrackpots.jpg\n|rides = [[Kitchen Kabaret]]\n|appearance = Various anthropomorphic Kraft-brand condiment packages}}The '''Kitchen Krackpots''' was a jazz band comprised of anthropomorphic oversized Kraft-brand condiment packages. They served as the house band in the former [[Kitchen Kabaret]] show at [[Epcot]]. These animatronics were the first food products to come. \n\nThe 5 members of this band included:\n*A Mayonnaise jar, leading the group on beet and tuna can drums\n*A Barbecue Sauce bottle, playing an egg-beater like a bass\n*A Parmesan Cheese container, playing a banjo made out of a measuring cup\n*A Mustard bottle, playing a saxophone made with a drinking straw\n*A Salsa jar, playing a matchstick piano\n\n==Role in the Show==\n===Act 1===\nThe Band first played a ragtime intro, before [[Bonnie Appetite]] appeared to sing. The Kitchen Krackpots came out of the floor and reappeared in the ending of the show.\n\n===Finale===\nThe Kitchen Krackpots, along with the rest of the cast, sang a medley of each of their songs. All of the cast came back out and Bonnie said good bye before the curtains with the Kraft logo covered the stage.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The only member of the band that actually spoke in the show was the group's leader, the Mayonnaise jar. He said two lines during the show: \"Okay, Krackpots. Let's get cooking!\" and \"All right, gang, take it on home!\". However, since none of their mouths moved, it's not entirely certain which member actually said those lines.\n*In [[1993]], when Nestle replaced Kraft as the sponsor of [[The Land]] pavilion (where Kitchen Kabaret was located), some of the Krackpots were redesigned, presumably to reflect Nestle-brand packaging. The Mayonnaise jar was changed into a Spaghetti Sauce jar, the Barbecue Sauce bottle became a Salad Dressing bottle, and the Parmesan Cheese container became a Pepper container.\n\n<gallery>\nkrackpots1993.jpg\n400003463503-1.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Bands]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Foods]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Kitchen Kabaret characters]]\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Music groups]]"
