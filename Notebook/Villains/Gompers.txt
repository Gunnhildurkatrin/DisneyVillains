The goat usually finds his way inside the Mystery Shack, and at one point, ate all of the household's tin cans.\n\n==Role in the series==\nGompers first appears in \"[[Tourist Trapped]]\", standing on [[Dipper Pines|Dipper's]] bed and nibbling on [[Mabel Pines|Mabel's]] sweater. Gompers later nibbles on the pages of book ''[[Journal 3|3]]'' at the forest. At the end of the episode, the goat picks up a trapped [[Gnomes (Gravity Falls)|gnome]] in its mouth and runs off with him.\n\nThe goat appears next in \"[[Headhunters]]\", appearing outside the Mystery Shack a couple of times during the time of the murder of [[Grunkle Stan|a wax sculpture]] of Stan. He is also mentioned to be responsible for eating all of the Pines family's tin cans.\n\n[[File:Goat_10_year_ago.png|thumb|250px|Baby Gompers as seen in Blendin's Game]]In \"[[Boss Mabel]]\", Gompers is seen outside of the Mystery Shack when a bus load of tourists arrive. He is also seen in the end credits of the same episode where Stan is being lazy and dancing at the same time, where he attempts to steal Stan's fez, which they have a tug of war over.\n\n==Appearance==\n[[File:Gompers_appearance.png|90px|right]]\nGompers has a dull brown coat, a white stomach, and a dark brown spot on its lower back. It has yellow eyes and horizontal irises. Half of one of Gompers horns is missing.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Gompers is named after English Labor Union leader, [[Wikipedia:Samuel_Gompers|Samuel Gompers]].\n*Gompers has horizontal irises like real life goats, as opposed to most cartoon goats, who are depicted as having normal irises.\n\n{{GFWiki}}\n{{Gravity Falls}}\n[[Category:Gravity Falls characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Goats]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
