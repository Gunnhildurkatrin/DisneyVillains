Prior to this, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] wrote a letter to the mayor about an idea of setting up an alarm for an alien invasion; however, Lilo doubted that the mayor would listen to a kid like her.\n\nAnolo officially appeared\u00a0near the end of the episode when [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] escaped after being surrounded by [[Nicol\u00e9]] and the authorities of the [[Museum of Natural History Kauai]], to which two believed that the city was being attacked by a \"rampaging whale.\" When Lilo, [[Stitch]] and Yaarp appeared before them, Lilo, with the help of Stitch, got the courage to suggest to the mayor about installing an alien alarm system, even revealing that Yaarp himself was the alarm. At first, the mayor, along with Nicol\u00e9, were about to dismiss it, but then [[Charles and Mary]] came over, where they blamed the mayor for ruining their honeymoon by allowing [[Experiments|strange]] [[Wendy Pleakley|creatures]] in his city, and even reported that they were never returning. Afterwards, Lilo came up once again and gave the letter to Anolo, to which the mayor agreed to have Yaarp be the alarm at Lilo's [[Hula School|hula school]] in order to keep tourism.\n\nNicol\u00e9 then asks Anolo if he actually believes in the existence of aliens, to which the mayor replies that he doesn't; however, he does have hope that [[Mertle Edmonds|Mertle]] and [[Elena, Teresa, and Yuki|the hula girls]] will become voters someday, showing that he only agreed to have the alarm installed in order to avoid bad publicity and keep tourism active.\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Polynesian characters]]\n[[Category:Mayors]]\n[[Category:Politicians]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
