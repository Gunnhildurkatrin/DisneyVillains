She also wears an orange suit.\n\n==Personality==\nShe seems gentle and kind, but she is actually only interested in powering her plant, which creates brainwashing spores. She used to dislike her brothers and didn't want them to have fun. She is later revealed to be quite similar to Candace. \n\nShe was finally convinced by Candace to give up her plot by pointing out that taking control of those around her won't make her feel any special than others, though this led to her downfall as she ended up being devoured by Mama by mistake and transported back to Feebla-Oot to be taken to prison.\n\n== History ==\n\n==Trivia==\n*She serves as a dark side to Candace.\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n[[Category:Phineas and Ferb characters]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Character stubs]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]"
