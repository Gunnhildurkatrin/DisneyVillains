She is the younger sister of [[Fa Mulan|Mulan]].\n\n==Role in the film==\nHua Xiu is first seen taking care of [[Fa Mulan|Mulan]]'s hair by taking a spider out of it to which Mulan hears her parents talking about their daughter controlling herself. Years later, Hua Xiu is later present during a meeting with [[the Matchmaker]] just as she and Mulan arrive at another room where the Matchmaker tries to help Mulan be a good wife in the future. While listening to the Matchmaker, Hua Xiu notices a spider crawling on the table just as Mulan gets distracted in trying to rid the spider away. However, the meeting was unsuccessful, due to the spider causing her to dishonor Mulan just as the two sadly leave and return to [[Fa Zhou|Hua Zhou]].\n\nAt home, Xiu and her family discuss with each other about anyone who must contribute to the Imperial Army to fight against the Rourans as Hua Zhou refuses to let Mulan leave, trying to keep her safe from the invaders, much to her sadness and fear that Hua Zhou will not return from battle. Hua Xiu later remains with the Hua family as Mulan has left the Hua family household to save China due to the fact that according to [[Chi-Fu|the Chancellor]], every man must contribute to fight.\n\nWhen Mulan returns home from battle after saving the Imperial City from the Rourans, Hua Xiu happily reunites with Hua Mulan as the rest of Mulan's family members reunite with her while Mulan asks her father for forgiveness to which he accepts. Later when [[Commander Tung]], Sergeant Qiang, and the rest of the Imperial Army arrive to the Hua family, Qiang announces that Hua Zhou's sword is presented to Mulan for saving the dynasty and her family just as Hua Xiu happily praises Mulan for bringing honor to her family, bringing honor to her family once and for all.\n\n==Differences from the Source Material==\nBoth the Ming dynasty play ''Mulan Joins the Army ''and in the Qing dynasty novel ''Fierce and Filial'' mention that Mulan has a sister by the name of Hua Munan.<ref>[https://mulanbook.com/pages/overview/questions_about_mulans_legend_and_history Questions about Mulan's Legend and History, Answered]\n</ref> However, the pronunciation and spelling of \"Munan\" is very similar to \"Mulan,\" which may have caused confusion.\n\n==Trivia==\n*She is one of the several brand-new characters created for the live-action film.\n*Hua Xiu is younger than Mulan.\n*Hua Xiu is one of the Disney characters to have arachnophobia.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nMulan (2020 film) (36).png\nMulan (2020) - Matchmakers.png\nMulan (2020 film) (57).png\nMulan (2020 film) (60).png\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Mulan}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Character stubs]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in remakes]]\n[[Category:Chinese characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Mulan characters]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]"
