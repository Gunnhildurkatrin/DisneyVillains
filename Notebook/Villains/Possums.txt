"[[File:Possums.png|thumb|250px|Good morning, young prince!]]\nThe '''Possums''' are a group of minor characters from the film ''[[Bambi (film)|Bambi]]''. They first appeared in [[Bambi's mother]]'s thicket, gathering around with other animals to see the new prince that had been born. When [[Bambi (character)|Bambi]] and his mother explored the woods, the Possum family are seen again, hanging upside down by their tails. Bambi was puzzled, turning his head around trying to get a proper look at them. Mother Possum said good morning to Bambi and so did her children. In the final scene, they can be seen gathering around with the animals to see [[Faline]] in the thicket with her newborn twins.\n\n{{Bambi}}\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Bambi characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Opossums]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]"
