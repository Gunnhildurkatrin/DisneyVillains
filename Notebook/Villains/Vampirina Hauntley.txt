She is a young vampire whose family moved from Transylvania, [[Romania]] to [[Pennsylvania]] to open a local Scare Bed n' Breakfast.\n\n==Background==\nVampirina used to live in Transylvania with [[Boris Hauntley|her]] [[Oxana Hauntley|parents]], [[Demi]], and [[Gregoria]], where she lived a comfortable life and was popular at school. However, things changed when she and her family moved to Pennsylvania so her mother could achieve her dream of opening a B&B for traveling ghouls and monsters. While Vee was excited about the move, she also felt nervous about fitting in with humans, especially after the B&B scares away the first human they meet, [[Edna Peepleson]]. Luckily, she managed to befriend her new neighbors [[Poppy Peepleson]], [[Edgar Peepleson]], and [[Bridget (Vampirina)|Bridget]]. Poppy soon finds out about her identity as a vampire, but accepts her for her differences, and they become best friends. Bridget later finds out too, and while scared at first, also learns to accept her. Vee keeps her identity a secret from Edgar, however, since he likes to film supernatural things and upload it to his web show, which could prevent Vee and her family from living a quiet life.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nVampirina is a young vampire with periwinkle skin, pointy ears and fangs. Her hair is black with bat wing pigtails and has violet eyes. She dresses in a light magenta top and black dress with a spider web pattern, wears two blue fingerless gloves, and black boots. Even though she appears 8 years old, she is actually 200 years old.\n\nWhen she is being a Woodchuck Woodsie, she formerly wore her Ghoul Guide uniform although a blue sash was worn to put some badges in \"Woodchuck Woodsies\". But in \"The Woodsie Way\", she wore a new, more accurate uniform.\n\nAt bedtime, she wears two-tone purple pajamas with a blue ghost on the front. Her sleeves and pajama pants have blue bat patterns all over, and wears purple bat slippers.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nLike all vampires, Vee is very playful and can transform into a bat. However, when she gets shy and nervous she gets a case of the Battys, which is transforming back and forth into a bat uncontrollably. Also like all vampires, Vee can move very fast. She can instantly zoom from one place to another in a second without needing to speed up or slow down. She also has super hearing that makes things far away sound loud and clear. As seen in \"[[Vampire Weekend]]\", mastering all the abilities of a vampire is challenging, and requires a lot of concentration.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Vampirina is based on the titular character from the books by Anne Marie Pace.\n*In the episode \"[[Two Heads Are Better Than One]]\", Vampirina is revealed to be left-handed.\n**However, she plays the spookylele right-handed, suggesting she's ambidextrous.\n*She is afraid of baby cows and cute things as revealed in \"[[Hiccupire]]\".\n*[[Whoopi Goldberg]] dressed as Vampirina for the Halloween segment of her talk show, ''The View'', in [[2018]].\n\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nGoing Batty-Scare B&B 8.jpg\nGoing Batty-Scare B&B 7.jpg\nGoing Batty-Scare B&B 5.jpg\nGoing Batty-Scare B&B 4.jpg\nGoing Batty-Scare B&B 2.jpg\nGoing Batty-Scare B&B 3.jpg\nThe Sleepover-Portrait of a Vampire 1.jpg\nThe Sleepover-Portrait of a Vampire 2.jpg\nThe Sleepover-Portrait of a Vampire 4.jpg\nThe Sleepover-Portrait of a Vampire 3.jpg\nThe Sleepover-Portrait of a Vampire 5.jpg\nLittle-Terror-2.jpg\nLittle-Terror-4.jpg|Vampirina holding her baby cousin\nLittle-Terror-7.jpg|\"Peekaboo.\"\nLittle-Terror-8.jpg\nThe Woodchuck Woodsie Way.png\nVampire Weekend 1.png\nVampire Weekend 2.png|Vee and Poppy switch places by accident.\nVampire Weekend 3.png\nVampire Weekend 4.png\nVampire Weekend 5.png\nVampire Weekend 6.png\nThe Ghoul Girls 1.jpg\nThe Ghoul Girls 2.jpg\nBatty Fever 4.jpeg\nCountess Vee 1.jpg\nVampirina vee and poppy.jpg\nVampirina 435354.jpg\nVampirina 21332132.jpg\nDisney's vampirina vee 234423.jpg\nVampirina reading her book.jpg\nVampirina 3252552.jpg\nvampirina vee bridget and poppy.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nVampirina.jpg\nVampirina and Family.png|Vampirina and her family\nVampirina and Gregoria promo.png\nVampirina - Vee's Slumber Party.png\nVampirina - Vee's Fangtastic World.png\nVampirina - Meet Vampirina.png\nVampirina - Going Batty.png\nVampirina - Vee's First Day of School.jpg\nDisney-press-disney-vampirina-vees-monster-bash.jpg\nVampirina Poster.png\nVampirina Poster 2.png\nVampirina plush.jpg|Vampirina plush\nVampirina bat plush.jpg|Vampirina bat plush\nVampire Bat Vampirina.png|Vampirina's bat form\nVampirina Hauntley 1.png\nVampirina and Gregoria.png\nVampirina With Guitar.png\nWolfie on Vampirina's head.png\nVampirina and Doc McStuffins.png\n2D Poppy, Vee & Bridget.png\n2D Vee & Demi.png\nVee's emoji.PNG\n</gallery>\n\n===Stock Art===\n<gallery>\nvampirina.png\nvampirina2.png\nvampirina3.png\nvampirina4.png\nvampirina5.png\nvampirina6.png\nvampirina-gregoria.png\nvampirina-gregoria2.png\npoppy-vampirina.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Vampirina}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hauntley, Vampirina}}\n[[pt-br:Vampirina Sangueson]]\n[[Category:Vampirina characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Vampires]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Bats]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:European characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Dancers]]\n[[Category:Scouts]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Immortal]]\n[[Category:Nieces]]\n[[Category:Cousins]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Time travelers]]\n[[Category:Frogs]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]"
