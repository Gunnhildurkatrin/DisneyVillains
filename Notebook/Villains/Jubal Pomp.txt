His main ambition is to become as rich as [[Scrooge McDuck]]. His attempts at gaining wealth tend to be disastrous. When he tries to compete with Scrooge, he markets eccentric products (firefly-powered mood lights, for instance) that meet with varied success at best. When he tries to convince Scrooge to become partners in some project, the result is Jubal being kicked out of Scrooge's office.\n\nJubal sometimes helps [[Brigitta MacBridge]] try to get back at Scrooge by setting up businesses to rival his. On these occasions Jubal is more successful.\n\nHe first appeared in \"Zio Paperone e il ratto di Brigitta\" (free translation: \"Brigitta Kidnapped\"), Topolino #272 (February. 12, 1961). He appears as an upstart businessman who happens to overhear Scrooge mentioning his \"Secret of Prosperity\". Convinced that the contents of the Secret would open his path to true wealth, he sought to blackmail Scrooge. He abducted Brigitta McBridge, Scrooge's stalker/love interest and asked the contents of the Secret as ransom. Scrooge was at first reluctant if he should rescue her or take the opportunity to be free of her obsessive pursuit. However he finally decided on retrieving his lady and managed to locate Jubal's hiding place and launch a successful rescue operation. He also took the opportunity to explain that his \"Secret of Prosperity\" were the virtues which led him to wealth, not some kind of shortcut.\n\nJubal is bright and creative but his money making schemes are at times both clumsy and impractical. On his own Jubal is more of a nuisance than an actual threat. However Brigitta has decided that one way to impress Scrooge is prove her own worth as a businesswoman. Pooling her resources with Jubal, the duo have been able to launch a number of locally successful business operations in Duckburg. Providing true competition to Scrooge and often breaking his hold on a certain market. It helps that Brigitta appears to be equally resourceful to Scrooge in launching out new operations and surpasses him in the marketing and advertisement process. With her as a partner, Jubal enjoys much more success. There are a few stories that hint to him seeing Brigitta as more than a business partner and friend but they are not really romantically involved.<ref>http://www.comicvine.com/jubal-pomp/29-57828/</ref>\n\n==References==\n<references />\n{{Wikipedia|List of Donald Duck characters}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pomp, Jubal}}\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Chickens]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
