They run a lemonade stand at the bottom of the hill with a well. They realized that [[Goldie (Goldie & Bear)|Goldie]] and [[Bear (Goldie & Bear)|Bear]] were a cool pair of kids, so they decided to follow and imitate them. Unfortunately, they destroyed the play set [[Father Bear]] made. In the end, they realized that [[Big Bad]] was the cool one for being able to get so many lemons from the lemon tree. Most of the time they are background characters. Jack, without his sister, was part of an all Jack club. Both of them have a tendency to trip over their feet and fall down a lot.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nJill.png\nLittle Jack (Jack and Jill).png\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Goldie & Bear}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:Twins and Triplets]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Goldie & Bear characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]"
