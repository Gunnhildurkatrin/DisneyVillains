[[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]], however, refused with a diva tantrum, saying that they weren't interested in \"obscene amounts of cash\". They all left, saying that \"The Phineas and the Ferb-Tones is strictly a one-hit-wonder! Good day to you, sir!\" Once PFT was gone, Baxter said that it didn't matter, because they still had a tape of their song. The tape, however, vanished, thanks to [[Heinz Doofenshmirtz|Dr. Doofenshmirtz]]'s robot building which, thanks to [[Perry the Platypus|Agent P]], sneezed, causing the tape to fall out of Ben Baxter's hands and into Perry's hand. Agent P instantly used the tape to grab onto a flagpole, destroying it and preventing Baxter from making two decades of entertainment out of it (\"[[Flop Starz]]\").\n==Background Information==\n\nThe conference room where Ben Baxter meets with Phineas and the Ferb-Tones to discuss a recording contract has several awards visible on the walls. Among them is an award for Lindana that was received in 1985. However, when Dr. Doofenshmirtz and Agent P crash through the wall, the awards are missing on that wall.\n==Appearances==\n\n*\"[[Flop Starz]]\"\n*\"[[Run Away Runway]]\" (Cameo)\n*\"[[Finding Mary McGuffin]]\"\n*\"[[The Lemonade Stand]]\" (Cameo)\n*\"[[Rollercoaster: The Musical!]]\" (Cameo)\n*\"[[Meatloaf Surprise]]\" (Cameo)\n*\"[[Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension]]\" (Cameo)\n*\"[[Ferb Latin]]\" (Cameo)\n*\"[[The Mom Attractor]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n==References==\n<references/>{{DEFAULTSORT:Baxter, Ben}}\n\n{{PF-Wiki}}\n{{Phineas and Ferb}}\n[[Category:Phineas and Ferb characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
