She is very nice, but strict when it comes to homework. A group of activists known as the \"Earth Protectors\" have been giving out CDs about the environment to Scott's classmates, however the antagonist, Malcolm re-designs the CD-ROM program to brainwash whoever watches it for them to do what ever he wants. After many copies are made, Ms Parker distributes them to her students as homework. Oblivious to what the discs actually contain assuming its from the legit 'Earth Protectors'. Later in the film, Ms Parker becomes very confused with the odd behavior her students return to class in after being brainwashed from the 'homework'.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nVideoCapture_20200329-141447.jpg\nVideoCapture_20200329-141529.jpg\nVideoCapture_20200329-141613.jpg\nVideoCapture_20200329-141620.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Schoolteachers]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]"
