For example, even the kids with the best aim can't knock over the bottles in Joe's game because the bottles are taped to the back of the wall. Later with, the Penguin Man ([[Heinz Doofenshmirtz|Doofenshmirtz]]), Shady Joe makes it sound real, even though it's really only Doofenshmirtz wearing the head of a penguin costume with ripped out eyes. His ability to trick people this way might be how he earned the name \"Shady\" Joe.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nShadyJoe.png\n</gallery>{{PF-Wiki}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Joe}}\n{{Phineas and Ferb}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Phineas and Ferb characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
