Oh yeah, have a nice flight.|Safety spiel}}\n\n'''Patrick''' is a character from ''[[Soarin']]'' in ''[[Epcot|EPCOT]]'' and ''[[Disney's California Adventure]]''.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Background ===\nPatrick was the chief flight-attendant for ''Soarin''', an airline based in [[Grizzly Peak]], [[California]] and [[EPCOT (concept)|EPCOT]], [[Florida]] around the 2000s-2020s.  Patrick was involved in running Soarin's departures from these locations, having also seemingly lived in EPCOT.\n\n=== Development history ===\nThe role of Patrick was originally intended to be a character named '''Sandy''', portrayed by [[John Travolta]].  This would have been an allusion to the character of Sandy Olsson from the [[1978]] musical ''Grease'' which Travolta starred in.  However, issues arose due to shooting-schedules and imagineers not wanting the character to have Travolta's beard.   Following a screening of ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]'', imagineers found actor [[Patrick Warburton]]'s performance as [[Kronk]] so funny that they asked him to do Soarin' in Travolta's place.<ref>https://wdwnt.com/2020/12/imagineer-shares-how-patrick-warburton-was-cast-in-soarin-pre-show/</ref>  The character was named Patrick as an allusion to his actor.\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n=== Soarin' ===\nPatrick appears in the safety videos for Soarin'.  At the beginning of the ride, he can be heard saying, \"Soarin\u2019 to Tower.  We are ready for takeoff\" and at the end of the attraction he informs guests on how to disembark and in Florida, tells them to enjoy their stay in EPCOT.\n\n== Trivia ==\n\n* In ''Soaring: Fantastic Flight'', Patrick's role is assumed by the ghost of [[Camellia Falco]] while in ''Soaring Over the Horizon'' it is by an [[Arbori]] shaman.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Soarin' characters]]\n[[Category:Soarin']]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
