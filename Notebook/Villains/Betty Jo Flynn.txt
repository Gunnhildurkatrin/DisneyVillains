Her first appearance was \"[[Get That Bigfoot Outta My Face!]]\"\n\n==Biography==\nBetty Jo Flynn is old, but still a child at heart. Even though she is elderly, she is still very athletic and a great rollerskater. It is possible that she is very competitive.\n\n==Life==\n===Early life===\nBetty Jo Flynn was born with her identical twin, Lorraine. They were most likely born in Danville.\n===Early Adult Years===\nBetty Jo was part of the rollerskating derby early in her adult life. Her team, the Tri-State Bombers, almost won, but Hildegard Johnson cheated at last minute causing their team to lose. Ever since then, Betty Jo and Hildegard have been enemies.\n\n===Middle Life===\nWhen she was a little older she married [[Clyde Flynn]]. She gave birth to two young girls, [[Linda Flynn-Fletcher]], and Tiana Weber (n\u00e9e Flynn).\n\n===Later Years===\nWhen she became older, her daughter was married to [[Lawrence Fletcher]], and she had three grandchildren: Candace, Phineas, and Ferb. Every year, she invites her grandchildren and their friends to their cabin in the Danville Woods. Once, she visited the Flynn-Fletcher family along with her husband, Clyde. Once Phineas learned about her being in the rollerskating derby, they decided to build a rollerskating rink for a rematch with Betty Jo, Candace, and Ferb against Hildegard, [[Jeremy Johnson|Jeremy]], and [[Suzy Johnson]]. The results were a tie. They had another rematch, but the results were unseen.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Phineas Flynn and Ferb Fletcher===\nPhineas Flynn and Ferb Fletcher are Betty Jo's grandsons. They are nice to each other, and she knows about their Big Ideas.\n\n===Candace Flynn===\nCandace is Betty's granddaughter, and she is very helpful. She tried to give Candace advice on enjoying the woods once. When they had the skating rematch, Betty made Candace the lead skater.\n\n===Hildegard Johnson===\nEver since they were young, they were enemies. Betty Jo described Hildegard as a \"cheater\" while Hildegard called her a \"loser\". Around 50 years later, they instantly recognized each other. They still hated each other, and had two rematches. The first rematch was a tie, while the second is unknown.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Her name is listed incorrectly as \"Betty Joe\" in the credits of many episodes.\n*She has been a rival of Hildegard Johnson, specifically in roller derby.\n*She has been shown to be a bit sarcastic to [[Candace Flynn|Candace]].\n*She made an appearance in only one episode of Season 2, but it was confirmed that she would appear in Season 3.<ref>http://phineasandferb.wikia.com/wiki/User:Marekos1996/Jeff_Marsh_Correspondence#Season_2</ref> She would have 3 speaking roles in that season, but just a cameo and was pictured once in Season 4.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nBettyJo.jpg\nTri-State Bombers 2.jpg|Young Betty Jo Flynn\nBetty_Jo_sees_Hildegard.jpg|Betty Jo Flynn with her glasses off\nchar 45900.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Phineas and Ferb}}\n{{PF-Wiki}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Flynn, Betty Jo}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Phineas and Ferb characters]]\n[[Category:Grandparents]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
