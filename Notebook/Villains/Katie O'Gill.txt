She enjoys caring for her elderly father, but still finds time to enjoy herself at dances in town at night. She is tough and no-nonsense with Darby and brave enough to stand up to the bullying [[Pony Sugrue]], but she understands her father's unique relationship with the Leprechauns. As Darby puts it, 'she has a tongue would clip a hedge.'\n\nWhen Michael MacBride comes to replace Darby as a caretaker on [[Lord Fitzpatrick]]'s order, Katie runs into town to fetch Darby at the pub and he leads her to believe he is merely hired help. Michael and Katie soon warm to each other, and Darby and [[King Brian]] decide to encourage their love. King Brian visits Katie and Michael in their dreams. Though Katie insists she has no interest in a husband, King Brian convinces her to go with Michael on a visit to the ruins of Knocknasheega outside of town the next day. When Pony arrives and tries to pick a fight with Michael, Katie intervenes and orders Pony off. Nevertheless, she and Michael share their first kiss.\n\nWhen Pony's mother, [[Sheelah Sugrue|Sheelah]], tells her the truth about Michael, she is furious with him, believing he lied to her and came to take Darby's job away. When he tries to ask her to marry him, she refuses to listen and leaves to fetch Darby at the pub. At night, when Michael stops her from finding Darby horse, Cleopatra, she slaps him; telling him she does not love him. However, she has a dangerous fall and is later found by Darby in a coma with a fever when trying to catch Cleopatra at Knocknasheega.\n\nBy that night, she is in danger of dying as the Death Coach, summoned by the [[Banshee (Darby O'Gill and the Little People)|Banshee]], comes to claim her soul. Fortunately, she is saved by the intervention of Darby and King Brian. On recovering, she and Michael makeup and admit their love for one another.\n\nThe film ends with Darby driving his cart with Michael and Katie in the back, singing \"[[Pretty Irish Girl]]\" reprise and sharing a kiss as they ride off.\n{{Stubsection}}\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*The song \"Pretty Irish Girl\", apparently sung by [[Sean Connery]] and Janet Munro, has been alleged to feature dubbed vocals by Irish singers, Brendan O'Dowda and Ruby Murray.\n*The lines of poetry quoted by Katie and Michael which include \"The hills of old Ireland, how wondrously they stand\" are from the poem \"The Pillar Towers of Ireland\" by Denis Florence MacCarthy (1817-1882).\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:O'Gill, Katie}}\n{{Darby O'Gill and the Little People}}\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Darby O'Gill and the Little People characters]]\n[[Category:Stub]]\n[[Category:Character stubs]]\n[[Category:Deuteragonists]]\n[[Category:Irish characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]"
