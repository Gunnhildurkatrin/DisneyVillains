They are a pair of Italian culinary artists that run [[Tony's Restaurant|Tony's]] and are longtime friends of the [[Tramp]], whom they affectionately refer to as \"Butch\".\n\n==Background==\n<tabber>Tony=\n'''Tony''' (voiced by George Givot) the owner, waiter, and namesake of the restaurant. He is a lovable man with a larger-than-life personality. Like Joe, is an unabashed lover of dogs, especially the Tramp. In fact, he is one of the very few people in the town that actually sees the Tramp as his friend, rather than a mangy pest. Though generally friendly, Tony can sometimes be a little short-tempered, especially with Joe.\n\nTony carries a plump figure. He has black hair, but he is half bald. He also possesses both black eyes and thick matching Italian-style mustache, medium skin, thick black eyebrows, and lavender circles. He wears a teal vest, a pink long-sleeved shirt with a brief V-cut neckline, collar, and each gold cufflink on both sides of his cuffs, both black string tie and armbands, a white apron, a pair of navy pants, and a pair of brown low-heeled shoes. On their romantic evening, he plays his accordion when he sings ''Bella Notte'' to Lady and the Tramp with Joe, who plays his mandolin.\n|-|Joe=\n'''Joe''' (voiced by [[Bill Thompson]]) works at the restaurant as a chef. While Joe is a loyal employee and just as jolly as his boss, he can be annoyed by Tony's short temperament, being that he usually finds himself at the other end of Tony's outbursts.\n\nJoe carries a slender figure. He has both black curly hair and eyes, medium skin, lavender circles, thick black Italian-style mustache and thick matching eyebrows. He wears a white elbow-length shirt with each couple light gray horizontal buttons vertically on his chest, a white bandanna, a light gray apron, a pair of olive pants, a pair of brown low-heeled shoes, and a white chef hat. On their romantic evening, he plays his mandolin when he sings ''Bella Notte'' to Lady and the Tramp with his boss Tony, who plays his accordion.\n</tabber>\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lady and the Tramp]]''===\nIn ''Lady and the Tramp'', Joe is first seen when the [[Tramp]], or \"Butch\" as nicknamed by both him and Tony, stops by Tony's to get a bite of breakfast. Later on in the film, the Tramp brings his latest girlfriend [[Lady]] to the restaurant for dinner. Tony tells Joe to get the Tramp some bones. Then, when Tony sees Lady, he knocks the plate of bones off of Joe's hand in a terrible fury and orders him to cook Lady and the Tramp a fancy dinner, instead. When the Tramp tells Tony in dog language what he wants, Tony tells Joe that the Tramp has said that he would like spaghetti for dinner, to which Joe replies, \"Tony, dogs don't talk.\" But when Tony says that the Tramp is talking to him, Joe says, \"OK, he's-a talking-a to you! You the boss-a!\" Joe then gives his boss the food, while muttering \"Mamma Mia\" in Italian. To further the romantic evening, Tony and Joe perform the song \"[[Bella Notte]]\" for the couple. Joe plays the mandolin while Tony plays the accordion.\n\n===''[[Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure]]''===\nTony and Joe (voiced here by [[Jim Cummings]] and [[Michael Gough]]) are first seen early in the film, serving [[Jim Dear]], [[Darling]], [[Jim Jr.|Junior]], Lady, the Tramp, and their puppies a plate of spaghetti. [[Scamp]] barks and jumps up excitedly when he sees the spaghetti, which causes Joe to lose his balance and dump the spaghetti in Tony's face. Later on in the movie, Scamp brings [[Angel]] to Tony's where Tony and Joe present them with spaghetti, just as they did with Scamp's parents in the past.\n\n===Other appearances===\nIn the ''[[House of Mouse]]'' episode \"[[Max's Embarrassing Date]]\", Tony and Joe were booked to set up a romantic date for [[Max Goof]] and [[Roxanne]].\n\n==Live-action appearances==\n===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===\nTony, portrayed by Emanuel Fappas, appears in the episode \"The Apprentice\", as the owner of the Italian restaurant where [[Emma Swan]] and [[Captain Hook|Killian]] share a romantic dinner.\n\n===[[Lady and the Tramp (2019 film)|''Lady and the Tramp'' (2019)]]===\nTony (portrayed by F Murray Abraham) and Joe (portrayed by Arturo Castro) appear in the [[2019]] [[Disney +]] live-action adaptation of the animated film.\n\n==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==\n===[[Walt Disney World]]===\nTony and Joe have made occasional appearances as face characters at the [[Magic Kingdom]] park at [[Tony's Town Square Restaurant]] on [[Main Street, U.S.A.]], an Italian dining location inspired by the film. Tony and Joe also appear during the bubble sequence in [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] version of [[Fantasmic!]].\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the Italian translation, their nickname for Tramp is Biagio il Randagio (meaning Biagio the stray dog).\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nTramp-disneyscreencaps com-5166.jpg|Tony\nTramp-disneyscreencaps com-5180.jpg|Joe\nHouse Of Mouse - Max's Embarrassing Date1.jpg|Tony and Joe in the ''House of Mouse'' episode, \"Max's Embarrassing Date\"\nTonyjoe.jpg|Tony and Joe at the Disney Parks\nOctober15th.png|his [[Disneystrology]] page\nLady Tramp Tony Joe Rinaldi (2).jpg|Tony with [[Lady]] and Tramp by Joe Rinaldi\nTony Tramp Concept Art.jpg\nLadytramp2artjoetony.jpeg\nLTspaghettetisceneWDCC.png\nLady and tramp poster.jpeg\nLady and tramp UK poster.jpeg\nTony Production CEL.jpg\nLadyandtramp2-disneyscreencaps.com-23.jpg\nLady-tramp-2-disneyscreencaps.com-121.jpg\nLady-tramp-2-disneyscreencaps.com-130.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Lady and the Tramp}}\n[[es:Tony y Joe]]\n[[fr:Tony et Joe]]\n[[ja:\u30c8\u30cb\u30fc\u3068\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc]]\n[[pt-br:Tony e Joe]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Lady and the Tramp characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Fantasmic characters]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Italian characters]]\n[[Category:Chefs]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Once Upon a Time characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Magic Kingdoms characters]]"
