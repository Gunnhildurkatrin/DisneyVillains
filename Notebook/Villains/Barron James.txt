We can see that he thinks singer [[Lola Scott]] is very pretty. We first see him come up on stage at the first day behind De La Duke with Sander and rap a song about Camp Rock; obviously very confident and funny. He also raps and sings at Final Jam with Sander and\u00a0Ella.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:James, Barron}}\n[[Category:Camp Rock characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Dancers]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
