He is a sutior for [[Jasmine|Princess Jasmine]] and attempts to marry her, despite her engagement to [[Aladdin (character)|Aladdin]].\n\n==Role in the episode==\nIn \"[[Do the Rat Thing]]\", Wazoo is first trying to get Jasmine to marry him, despite her repeatedly telling him that she's already engaged to Aladdin. When the prince feels Jasmine's hair, a rat shows up and grabs his nose. Terrified of the rat, Wazoo pulls out a dagger, but Aladdin shows up and removes the rat from Wazoo's nose and the prince thanks Aladdin, revealing his fear of rats.\n\nWazoo reappears with [[the Sultan]], who says that he's going to show him the marketplace. Everyone goes to the marketplace so Wazoo can buy things for Jasmine, treating Aladdin like a servant, the Prince spends time thinking of what to buy. The prince eventually gets bored and makes Aladdin put him on a camel. He then sees a rat version of Jasmine, whom he mistakes for a real rat.\n\nCome nighttime and everyone is having a feast, but they're waiting for Jasmine to show up. Wazoo sees Jasmine, who is still a rat, again and gets scared. After Jasmine returns to normal, she goes to the palace with the Sultan. When Aladdin and Wazoo see that Jasmine still has a rat tail, the prince realizes that the princess is more of Aladdin's type than his and gives up.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The character shares an analogous role to [[Prince Achmed]] from the first ''[[Aladdin (film)|Aladdin]]'' movie. They're both snooty mustachioed suitors of [[Jasmine]] and get their pants ripped off by [[Rajah]]. But in comparison to Achmed, Wazoo appears less hostile to Aladdin and more clumsy.\n*The name, Wazoo, is slang term for buttocks.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\">\nDtrt02.jpg\nDtrt03.jpg|Prince Wazoo attacked by a rat\nDtrt04.jpg\nDtrt05.jpg\nDtrt36.jpg\nDtrt37.jpg\nDtrt38.jpg|\"I could hate you.\"\nDtrt39.jpg\ndtrt55.jpg|Prince Wazoo falling into the fountain\ndtrt66.jpg|Prince Wazoo shocked by Jasmine's tail.\ndtrt67.jpg|Prince Wazoo admits Jasmine is more Aladdin's type.\nPrince Wazoo - Do the Rat Thing (10).png\nPrince Wazoo - Do the Rat Thing (9).png\nPrince Wazoo - Do the Rat Thing (8).png\nPrince Wazoo - Do the Rat Thing (7).png\nPrince Wazoo - Do the Rat Thing (6).png\nPrince Wazoo - Do the Rat Thing (5).png\nPrince Wazoo - Do the Rat Thing (4).png\nPrince Wazoo - Do the Rat Thing (3).png\nPrince Wazoo - Do the Rat Thing (2).png\nPrince Wazoo - Do the Rat Thing (1).png\nAladdin and Prince Wazoo - Do the Rat Thing (3).png\nAladdin and Prince Wazoo - Do the Rat Thing (2).png\nAladdin and Prince Wazoo - Do the Rat Thing (1).png\nRajah and Prince Wazoo - Do the Rat Thing.png\nAladdin and Prince Wazoo - Do the Rat Thing.png\nAladdin, the Sultan and Prince Wazoo - Do the Rat Thing.png\nThe Sultan and Prince Wazoo - Do the Rat Thing.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Aladdin}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wazoo, Prince}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Princes]]\n[[Category:Aladdin characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Middle Eastern characters]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
