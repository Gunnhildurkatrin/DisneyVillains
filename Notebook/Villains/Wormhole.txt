'''Experiment 272''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]]. He is designed to generate portals to parallel universes. He also has advanced language programming to assist him as he traverses alternate realities. Jumba implanted a tracking device so that he would be able to locate Wormhole in whatever universe the experiment travels to. Once a transdimensional portal is created, it only lasts for a short period of time. Luckily, Wormhole has the ability to locate any portal he creates so he can leave before it closes. He appears in ''[[Stitch!]]''.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nWormhole is generally nice, rather than the standard evil programming, and his feelings can get easily hurt. He has a deep respect for [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], his creator, and if he holds a grudge against him, Wormhole will spend every moment possible searching for a way for his creator to like him again. Also, if he lost something of Jumba's, he will search every corner of every universe to find it. He can be quite oblivious, but he is actually helpful if he can finish whatever he was doing (or looking for) before.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nWormhole is a purple and cyan caterpillar-like experiment with black eyes, two dark purple-tipped antennae, eight dark purple-tipped legs, and a blue inner mouth. His antennae also flicker and light up.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nWormhole creates portals to other dimensions by jumping up in the air and folding himself into a ball then spinning. This opens up a wormhole directly behind him. These portals only last for a few days, and Wormhole can locate any one of them which is open. While he can create one at any time, he has absolutely no power over which universe the portal may lead to.\n\nWormhole has advanced language programming, and his ability to speak fluently helps him as he traverses alternate realities.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment 272 was the 272nd genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to create a wormhole to parallel universes.\u00a0Jumba got angry at 272 for being too nice and threw his favorite slipper at the experiment, but it unfortunately went into one of 272's wormholes and became trapped in another dimension. 272 was deactivated at some point and, along with the other 624 experiments, smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his\u00a0mission to capture\u00a0[[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\nAll the experiments were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.\n\nAt an unknown point, 272 was activated and named Wormhole, who then continued on his quest to find Jumba's slipper that he had lost long ago.\n\n===''[[Stitch!]]''===\nApproximately 25 years later, prior to Wormhole's eponymous debut, [[Stitch]] had left [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and found a new owner, [[Yuna Kamihara|Yuna]], who came across Wormhole when she was upset at her cousin, [[Tigerlily]].\n\nWormhole explains his backstory to Yuna while informing her that he was about to set out to another dimension, and she quickly asks if she could tag along. Wormhole warns Yuna that it would be drastically different than her current dimension, though she chimes that \"it couldn't be worse than this one.\" As Yuna\u00a0is entering, Stitch spots her going into Wormhole's portal and tries to stop her, but\u00a0ends up getting dragged along himself.\n\nFrom there, Wormhole sets off to find [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]]'s slipper, exclaiming he could sense it was near and being oblivious to Yuna and Stitch's predicament. Wormhole also ignores Yuna and Stitch's pleading\u00a0to go back\u00a0because he is so sure the slipper ended up in some dimension.\n\nBy the end of the episode, Wormhole finds the alternate dimension and\u00a0Jumba's slipper\u00a0in his closet, and the alternate Jumba watches confusedly as Wormhole drags it out. He then agrees to find his previous wormhole \u2013 but there wasn't much time until it closed. They barely make it through the portal, and Wormhole delightedly returns the slipper to his creator, who is surprised to see it again.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Wormhole's number was listed as 275 in the end credits of ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]'', which is [[Tickle-Tummy]]'s number in the ''[[Stitch!]]'' anime. Tickle-Tummy does not appear in the end credits of ''Leroy & Stitch'', while 272 is listed as Mamf.\n*Wormhole is one of the few known experiments that can speak fluently.\n*Wormhole is the only known experiment with eight legs. [[Shortstuff]] has eight limbs, but only uses four for locomotion.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nscreenCapture 30.03.13 10-59-31.jpg\nscreenCapture 30.03.13 11-06-28.jpg\nscreenCapture 30.03.13 11-13-29.jpg\nscreenCapture 30.03.13 11-13-58.jpg\nscreenCapture 30.03.13 11-14-25.jpg\nscreenCapture 30.03.13 11-14-54.jpg|\u8a66\u4f5c\u54c1272\u53f7 \u30ef\u30fc\u30e0\u30db\u30fc\u30eb translates to \"Prototype 272 Wormhole\"\nscreenCapture 30.03.13 11-15-24.jpg\nscreenCapture 30.03.13 11-15-56.jpg\nscreenCapture 30.03.13 12-32-02.jpg\nscreenCapture 30.03.13 12-32-42.jpg\nscreenCapture 30.03.13 16-14-46.jpg\nscreenCapture 30.03.13 16-19-39.jpg\nscreenCapture 30.03.13 16-20-00.jpg\nscreenCapture 30.03.13 16-35-15.jpg\nscreenCapture 30.03.13 16-45-40.jpg\nscreenCapture 30.03.13 17-04-46.jpg\nscreenCapture 30.03.13 17-06-57.jpg\nscreenCapture 30.03.13 17-08-18.jpg\nscreenCapture 30.03.13 17-12-38.jpg\nscreenCapture 30.03.13 17-13-01.jpg\nscreenCapture 30.03.13 17-13-21.jpg\nscreenCapture 30.03.13 17-20-20.jpg\nscreenCapture 30.03.13 17-26-30.jpg\nscreenCapture 30.03.13 17-29-19.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Bugs]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"
