Although she does not believe in giving animals ridiculous names, Miss Price calls him Cosmic Creepers because that's the name he came with. He's sensitive about new people, and will hiss at them.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]''===\nAs [[Miss Eglantine Price]] takes the children home, Cosmic Creepers hisses at the family, just as Price explains to them about the cat's name, just as Price takes the children to the new bedroom at the house. As Price gets her broom out, Cosmic later hears his owner reading that she would now be an apprentice witch just as she continues reading, Cosmic feels bored about what Price is doing. He then notices Price is flying on the Magic broomstick just as she practices on flying her broomstick like what a witch does to which her plan was unsuccessful. Later when Price turns Charlie into a rabbit, Cosmic starts chasing him across the living room, trying to eat him. However, as the spell is temporary, Charlie transforms back into a human, causing the cat to run away. Later, Miss Price teaches the children to recite the spell of what [[Professor Emelius Browne]] taught her to which Cosmic notices the magic being cast on the bed as Price and the children travel out of the bedroom via magic. Later on, as he was seen napping in the bedroom where the bed took off, he heard and sensed the bed returning and runs off frighted, almost getting run over. He was seen again in Miss Price's workroom with her, the children and Mr. Brown while Miss Price was testing the [[Substitutiary Locomotion]] Spell on her Teacher's shoes, before more objects came to life. While the five were feasting, he was fed a sausage and mash by Mr. Brown as a treat, because he wanted some while the children are full, before his tail got stepped on accidentally by Mr. Brown while he was showing off his juggling. In the end, he watches outside the window where Mr. Brown being escorted to the train station by the [[The Soldiers of the Old Home Guard|Soldiers of the Old Home Guard]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"180\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nCC.jpg|Cosmic Creepers while Miss Price and the children leave on the bed\nbedknobs-broomsticks-disneyscreencaps.com-1104.jpg|Cosmic Creepers hisses.\nbedknobs-broomsticks-disneyscreencaps.com-1535.jpg\nbedknobs-broomsticks-disneyscreencaps.com-1620.jpg\nbedknobs-broomsticks-disneyscreencaps.com-1646.jpg\nbedknobs-broomsticks-disneyscreencaps.com-1914.jpg|Watches Miss Price fly away\nbedknobs-broomsticks-disneyscreencaps.com-15932.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Template: Bedknobs and Broomsticks}}\n[[Category:Bedknobs and Broomsticks characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]"
