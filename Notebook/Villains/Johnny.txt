You're not supposed to think my dad is cool!|Vanessa to Johnny|Brain Drain}}\n'''Johnny''' is [[Vanessa Doofenshmirtz]]'s boyfriend during much of the first three seasons of ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]''. [[Heinz Doofenshmirtz]] calls him a nice fellow. He told Vanessa that her dad \"did a good job with this party\" (\"[[Dude, We're Getting the Band Back Together]]\"). He also told Vanessa that her dad was \"cool\" (\"[[Brain Drain]]\"). Vanessa later breaks up with Johnny on the phone because she felt that he thought a video game was more important then her (\"[[Minor Monogram]]\"). He is still dejected and irritated about the break-up by the start of the school year. On the first day of school, Johnny was accidentally but temporarily transformed into a part-ape, part-reptilian creature as the result on an experiment by Vanessa's father (who had just become a science teacher at their school and now considered the teen to be \"whiny\") and went on a rampage, taking Vanessa hostage before she managed to inject him with an antidote. Despite her audible warnings to the contrary, he took this as a sign that she was still romantically interested in him (\"[[Doof 101]]\").\n\n==Background Information==\n*His name and connection to Vanessa are possibly in reference to [[wikipedia:Johnny Depp|Johnny Depp]] and [[wikipedia:Vanessa Paradis|Vanessa Paradis]].\n*He is typically seen with his hair covering one of his eyes.\n*Johnny is a Punk, while Vanessa is a Goth.\n*His initial relationship to Vanessa appears to be similar to [[Candace Flynn]]'s relationship with [[Jeremy Johnson]] (in Vanessa's address book, she drew little hearts around his name.)\n*He knows how to play guitar (\"[[Skiddley Whiffers]]\").\n*He's allergic to bee stings (\"Skiddley Whiffers\").\n\n==Appearances==\n*\"[[Dude, We're Getting the Band Back Together]]\"\n*\"[[Brain Drain]]\"\n*\"[[Candace Gets Busted]]\" {{Cameo}}\n*\"[[Skiddley Whiffers]]\"\n*\"[[Doof 101]]\"\n\n{{PF-Wiki}}\n{{Phineas and Ferb}}\n[[Category:Phineas and Ferb characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
