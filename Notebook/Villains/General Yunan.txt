She is a female warrior newt who is from [[Newtopia]] and the youngest newt to achieve the rank of general in the Newtopian Army.\n\n==Background==\nGeneral Yunan achieved the rank of general among the Newtopian army at the youngest age ever, of which she boasts about regularly when introducing herself. \n\n===Personality===\nGeneral Yunan is very prideful and repeatedly boasts about her achievements, which she quotes a lot. She is psychotic and vicious to her enemies, being quite intelligent too as she was able to trick Percy and Braddock into revealing Grime's location.\n\n== Role in series ==\nIn \"[[Toadcatcher]]\", she was sent by Newtopia to capture [[Captain Grime|Grime]] for military failure in the Valley, however being defeated by him and [[Sasha Waybright|Sasha]] when they decided to work together.\n\nIn \"[[The First Temple]]\", she reported to [[King Andrias|Andrias]] about the continued civil disorder in the kingdom but their meeting was cut short when the king got a message from Marcy about her progress.\n\nIn \"[[True Colors (Amphibia)|True Colors]]\", she helped save [[Anne Boonchuy|Anne]] and her allies from the toad guards when Grime and his toad army invaded Newtopia. She later helped [[Polly Plantar|Polly]] and [[Frobo]] fight the toad soldiers in the city and distract them so Anne and [[Sprig Plantar|Sprig]] shut the city gates to prevent more toads from entering, also helping to remove a doorstop on the gate so it can be closed. They all succeed in stopping the invasion, but when they learned about Andrias' true sinister motivations, Yunnan protected [[Lady Olivia]] from [[Frog-Bot Army|Frog-Bots]] after both defected from him.\n\nIn \"[[Turning Point]]\", which continues where \"True Colors\" left off, it is revealed that Lady Olivia and Yunan were still around after the battle concluded, having likely hidden themselves throughout the fight. When Andrias recovered the [[Calamity Box]] after stabbing Marcy and transporting Anne and the Planters to Earth, the two make an attempt to flee the scene but Andrias spots them, with the King questioning if the two were with him or not. The two now afraid of King Andrias true nature and the power he now commands, Yunan swears fealty to him alongside Olivia. Andrias then instructed Olivia and Yunan to put Marcy in a  rejuvenation tank to save the girl's life.\n\nIn \"[[Olivia & Yunan]]\", Yunan continues to serve Andrias as he turns Amphibia into a wasteland.\n\n==Trivia==\n*[[Zehra Fazal]] said she drew inspiration from characters such as [[Darkwing Duck (character)|Darkwing Duck]] for her performance as Yunan.\n*Her name is probably a reference to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunnan_lake_newt Yunnan lake newt] (''Cynops wolterstorffi'').\n*Her retractable claws are similar to Marvel superhero [[Wolverine]].\n*When the episode \"[[True Colors (Amphibia)|True Colors]]\" was leaked online, a personal message from Yunan was released asking fans to wait for the official release of the episode and demands that the viewers remain strong and vigilant until the premiere.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Radrappy/status/1390785339577421830|title=Yunan Leak Post|website=Twitter|date=May 7, 2021}}</ref>\n*General Yunan is afraid of grubhogs when one seemingly almost ate her arm off as a little girl and was made fun of it.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"170\">\nAmphibia Season 2 poster 2.jpg\nGeneral_Yunnan_render.png|Render\nToadcatcher still 1.png\nToadcatcher (193).png\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[[w:c:amphibiapedia:General Yunan|General Yunan]]  at the [[w:c:amphibiapedia|Amphibia Wiki]]\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Amphibia}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Amphibia characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Warriors]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Urodela]]\n[[Category:Generals]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
