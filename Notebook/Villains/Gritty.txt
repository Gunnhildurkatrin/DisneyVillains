He is also proud of the fact that he does not need any machinery to accomplish his goals; his brute strength and muscles are all he needs to do his work.\n\nGritty doesn't like to use [[Gummiberry Juice]] (due to his first time using it, he didn't know how to stop, and just bounced uncontrollably until it wore off) but he does see a need for it on occasion. He's quite fond of [[Cubbi Gummi|Cubbi]], who idolizes Gritty. Despite his rough exterior, Gritty is often jolly and friendly around other Gummies.\n\nGritty initially hates humans due to them destroying his tribe's home, Barbic Woods, forcing them to move to [[Ursalia]]. In the episode \"[[True Gritty]]\", his hatred gets the better of him in harassing some shepherds, which leads to trouble for him and Cubbi, as well as Gruffi, Ursa, and [[Sir Thornberry]]. He learns his lesson when witnessing the consequences that his misdeeds have on others, after acting on hatred and secretly herding the shepherds' sheep away; he kindly returns them in the night.\n\n==Appearances==\n*\"[[Return to Ursalia]]\"\n*\"[[True Gritty]]\"\n*\"[[The Rite Stuff]]\"\n*\"[[King Igthorn|King Igthorn, Part 2]]\"\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=180 spacing=small position=center captionalign=center>\nGritty Gummi.jpg\nAdventuresOfTheGummiBears-ReturnToUrsalia-RoundTable.png\nE2 20.jpg\ne2_18.jpg\nE2 55.jpg\nE2 57.jpg\nGummi Bears KIng Igthorn Screenshot 49.JPG\n</gallery>\n\n{{Adventures of the Gummi Bears}}\n[[Category:Adventures of the Gummi Bears characters]]\n[[Category:Bears]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Gummi bears]]"
