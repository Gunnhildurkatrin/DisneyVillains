She is a basilisk who came to the human realm and took Luz's place.\n\n==Background==\nVee's kind had long been extinct until [[Emperor Belos]] somehow brought them back to life. Vee, along with other Basilisks, spent her whole life in captivity, forced to go through endless experiments to satisfy Belos' curiosity about their ability to extract magic. Eventually, Vee and several others managed to escape, but it was only a matter of time before Emperor Belos recaptured them. On the day she saw [[Luz Noceda|Luz]] arrive, Vee went through the same [[Portal (The Owl House)|Portal]] to escape. Upon arrival, she met Luz's mother, [[Camila Noceda]]. She took on Luz's form to hide her true appearance. She never intended to stay with Camila, but she quickly grew close to her. She showed her the only kindness she had ever known all her life. Since then, she has been living with Camila, pretending to be Luz.\n\nBy \"[[Yesterday's Lie]]\", her secret was eventually exposed when Luz managed to regain contact with the Human realm. Despite Camila knowing the truth, she still managed to see was not a nasty creature, but an innocent child who is frightened, alone, and seeks a place of belonging. After saving her from a witch obsessed curator, Camila welcomed Vee to continue living with her, which she happily accept.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nLike all Basilisks, Vee has the ability to extract magic, which gives her powers, such as the ability to shapeshift.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Prior to her name being revealed, fans gave her the nickname \"Creepy Luz\". The name derived from an interview with [[Sarah-Nicole Robles]], the voice actor of them and the real Luz, when she described voicing \"Creepy Luz\" as her favorite moment in the studio.\n**The description led fans to believe that the term referred to the existence of Luz's doppelg\u00e4nger, until [[Dana Terrace]] clarified that this was a joke response to the line \"''Maybe I'll meet a hot yet vulnerable upperclassman''\" from \"[[The First Day]]\". In the same post, she acknowledged (though did not necessarily confirm) the possibility of the doppelg\u00e4nger theory.\n*Vee's name being derived from \"Number 5\", \"V\" in Roman numerals, seems to be an homage to ''V for Vendetta'', in which the main character is an escaped test subject turned terrorist who calls himself \"V\", with the later revelation that it's not actually a letter, but the Roman numeral on her cell, room number five.\n*She is the second basilisk to appear in the show, followed by The Inspector from \"[[The First Day]]\".\n**Unlike the Inspector, however, Vee is kind and doesn't want to harm others. Even though it is a basilisk's nature to drain magic while the harming the one they take it from.\n**According to European bestiaries and legends, a basilisk is a legendary reptile reputed to be a serpent king, who can cause death with a single glance.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Concept art===\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nYesterday's Lie concept 8.jpg\nYesterday's Lie concept 9.jpg\nVee color design 1.jpg\nVee color design 2.jpg\nVee color design 3.jpg\nVee by mike austin.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nKeeping Up A-fear-ances (151).jpg|An imposter holding a tissue box\nYesterday's Lie (4).jpg\nYesterday's Lie (23).jpg|Vee as Luz\nYesterday's Lie (25).jpg|Meeting the real Luz\nYesterday's Lie (27).jpg\nYesterday's Lie (31).jpg\nYesterday's Lie (33).jpg\nYesterday's Lie (37).jpg\nYesterday's Lie (45).jpg\nYesterday's Lie (48).jpg\nYesterday's Lie (60).jpg\nYesterday's Lie (62).jpg\nYesterday's Lie (63).jpg\nYesterday's Lie (64).jpg\nYesterday's Lie (65).jpg\nYesterday's Lie (70).jpg|Vee sneaks to the portal\nYesterday's Lie (73).jpg|Meeting Camila\nYesterday's Lie (75).jpg\nYesterday's Lie (77).jpg\nYesterday's Lie (90).jpg|Trapped in a cage\nYesterday's Lie (99).jpg\nYesterday's Lie (130).jpg\nYesterday's Lie (140).jpg\nYesterday's Lie (144).jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*[[w:c:theowlhouse:Vee|Vee]] on [[w:c:theowlhouse|The Owl House Wiki]]\n\n{{The Owl House}}\n[[Category:The Owl House characters]]\n[[Category:Demons]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
