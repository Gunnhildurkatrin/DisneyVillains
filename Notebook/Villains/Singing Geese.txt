The characters were created for the [[Tomorrowland (Disneyland)|Tomorrowland]] attraction [[America Sings]] to be amongst the singing animatronic anthropomorphic animals.  Said attraction would close down in the 1980s.\n\nThe goose animatronics (along with the other animatronics of America Sings) were repurposed for the newly developed attraction, [[Splash Mountain]].  In said attraction, the geese would no-longer be presented as a musical quartet but rather simple ensembles in the musical sequences.\n\nTwo of the geese were also removed to be repurposed for yet another attraction in the form of [[Star Tours]].  These geese would be removed of their synthetic skins and turned into droids named [[G2-9T]] and [[G2-4T]].  As homages to the origins of their animatronics, the G2 droids were given the nickname of, \"Goose-Droids\"\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n=== America Sings ===\nThe Geese appeared in America Sings as a singing quartet.  The geese were amongst Ollie Owl and [[Sam the Eagle (America Sings)|Sam the Eagle]] in being the only characters who appeared in each of the era-based show-scenes of the attraction.  The geese would open up every different show-scene's era by performing a song while dressed in the wardrobe of the time.\n\n=== Splash Mountain ===\nIn Splash Mountain, the geese are encountered in the ''[[How Do You Do?]]'' song-number when guests first enter the animal world of the mountain.  Rather than appearing as a quartet, they are singing fishermen who attempt to catch fish.  Another one of the geese appears behind a tree, holding a pocket-watch and cane while wearing a top-hat.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* G2-9T sings the songs, \"''I've Been Working on the Same Droid, all the livelong day\"'' in ''Star Tours'' and ''\"I've Been Looking at the Same Bag, all the livelong day''\" in [[Star Tours: The Adventures Continue|''Star Tours: The Adventures Continue'']].  Both of these songs are parodies of, \"''I've been working on the railroad''\" which was sung by the geese in America Sings' old south sequence.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nGeeseQuartet.jpg\nKSKPBK 12 77 N03R.jpg\nAmersings 2.jpg\n2012americasings2.jpg\nGeese&frogs.jpg\nLaughingplaceband.JPG\nGeesefishing.jpg.JPG\n</gallery>\n\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Splash Mountain characters]]\n[[Category:Geese]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:America Sings]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
