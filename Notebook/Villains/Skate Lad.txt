He is a young Mexican kid who lives with his unnamed mom and dad (who runs the sporting goods store) and his two infant sisters known only as \"The Twins\". He was recruited to the team due to his superb skateboarding skills. Prior to his recruitment, he had been the state's skateboarding champion for three years running and was up for a new challenge. As Skate Lad, he uses a special jet-propelled skateboard to outrun his opponents.\n\nAt times, Hector can be a little stubborn. In the episode \"[[Something Cheesy Comes This Way!]]\", he initially refused to help because the villain of the day was a cheese cook he was a big fan of, and he did not want to accept that she had turned to a life of crime. He also once got upset when it seemed like his teammates were preferring the skills of [[Scooter Lad]] (who turned out to be a crook) over his. However, he is loyal to the cause and always comes to the team's aid in the end.\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"209\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nSkateLad01.jpg\nHectorPatDuckie.jpg|Hector patting his toy duck, Mr. Paddle.\nHectorArcade.jpg|Hector playing an arcade game while Crandall watches.\nHectorSkateboarding.jpg|Hector skateboarding.\nSkateLadGoggles.jpg|Skate Lad putting on his goggles.\nLordDruidTiedUp.jpg\nBeholdTheAwesomePowerOfMyStonehenge.jpg\nDrDroid19.jpg\n250px-Teamosupremo.jpg|Skate Lad with [[Captain Crandall]] and [[Rope Girl]]\nSkate Lad's Alternative Outfit.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Teamo Supremo}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Teamo Supremo characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]\n[[Category:Superheroes]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
