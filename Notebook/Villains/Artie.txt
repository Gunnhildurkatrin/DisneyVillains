He is the owner of a vintage clothing store who admires [[Cruella De Vil|Cruella]]'s sense of fashion.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Cruella]]''===\nArtie is the owner of a small vintage fashion clothing store called ''2nd Time Around'', who immediately takes a liking to [[Cruella De Vil|Estella Miller]] when she enters his shop. She comments on his flamboyant fashion sense which includes sheer tops, lightning bolt makeup, and bold pieces, to which he admits that while he does get insults, the biggest one of all would be normal - which he never gets. \n\nDue to his own love of fashion, as well as his interest in causing an uproar, Estella, now known as Cruella, offers him the chance to design and create a line of clothes to help overshadow [[Baroness Von Hellman]]'s own clothing line. He graciously accepts and moves into the home she shares with [[Jasper and Horace]]. When Cruella is believed to have been killed, Artie mourns her loss by looking at a newspaper. He is delighted when she returns to his store in disguise to ask for his help in one final scheme against Baroness. \n\nHe's fine with helping her as long as he doesn't have to die, which is a concern of his. He asks if she really killed the Dalmatians to turn them into coats, as the media speculates, but Cruella admits that she didn't, though she likes that everyone thinks she did. He helps [[Jasper and Horace]] create \"Cruella\" wigs for Baroness's guests and directs guests outside so they can witness Baroness \"kill\" Estella. Once Baroness is arrested, Artie moves into [[Hell Hall]] alongside Cruella, Jasper, Horace, and their dogs.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Artie was created specifically for ''[[Cruella]]'' and has no animated counterpart.\n*When the character was first announced, critics and journalists labeled him as Disney's first live-action gay character, though this was incorrect as he follows in the footsteps of [[LeFou]] in the 2017 remake of ''[[Beauty and the Beast (2017 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]''.\n*He has similar role with [[Lars]] as both of them are eccentric and help Cruella with her plan.\n\n{{101 Dalmatians}}\n[[Category:English characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:101 Dalmatians characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]"
