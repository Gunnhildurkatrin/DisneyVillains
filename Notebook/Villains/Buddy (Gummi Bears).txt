"{{Infobox character\n|image = Buddy.jpg\n|name = Buddy\n|shows = ''[[Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]''\n|voice = [[Dana Hill]]\n|home = [[Ursalia]]\n|family = Unknown\n|likes = To succeed the big Bear consecration, having fun with Cavin, whistling his flute\n|dislikes = Gobbas, being clumsy on his own }}\n'''Buddy''' is a young [[Gummi Bears|Gummi Bear]], around [[Sunni Gummi|Sunni's]] age. He is a member of the Barbic tribe of Gummi bears and is [[Ursa (Gummi Bear)|Ursa]]'s protege.\n\nDespite being a Barbic, Buddy's personality is the most laid back and gentle of the tribe, as he prefers practicing his flute and generally having fun with developing his skills as a warrior. This puts him at constant odds with Ursa, who is adamant that he put away what she believes to be \"childish\" pastimes and develop in the true Barbic tradition.\n\nHe first appears in episode 47 (\"[[Return to Ursalia]]\") when the [[Gummi Glen]] Gummies take a trip to [[Ursalia]] and meet the Barbics who now live there. Buddy quickly develops a friendship with [[Sunni Gummi|Sunni]] and the two play a small, but vital role in the episode, as they narrowly escape capture by [[Duke Igthorn]], and discover the [[Ursalia Horn|Ultimate Gummi Weapon]] hidden in the heart of Ursalia.\n\nEpisode 67 (\"[[The Rite Stuff]]\") is all about him, and his Test of Bear-hood, as he prepares to come of age as a Barbic. Buddy is initially depressed over the added pressure from Ursa of competing against [[Cavin]], which worsens after he loses the first challenge of the test to the young human. After Cavin saves his life in Gordian Gulch, Buddy angrily quits the test, believing that he will never live up to Ursa's standards and become a true Barbic.\n\nHowever, Buddy saves Cavin from a monster moments later and the two become friends as Cavin quits the test himself for the same reason as Buddy. Buddy ultimately gains his bear-hood, and Ursa's respect, along with Cavin, as they work together to rescue Ursa, [[Gruffi Gummi|Gruffi]] and [[Sir Thornberry]] from a pair of satyr-like Gobbers.\n\n==Appearances==\n*\"[[Return to Ursalia]]\"\n*\"[[True Gritty]]\" (briefly, silent)\n*\"[[The Rite Stuff]]\"\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=180 spacing=small position=center captionalign=center>\nAdventuresOfTheGummiBears-ReturnToUrsalia-SunniAndBuddy.png\nAdventuresOfTheGummiBears-TheRiteStuff-BarbicTraditionInUrsalia.png\nAdventuresOfTheGummiBears-Ursalia-Buddy.png\nBuddi.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Adventures of the Gummi Bears}}\n[[Category:Adventures of the Gummi Bears characters]]\n[[Category:Bears]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Gummi bears]]"
