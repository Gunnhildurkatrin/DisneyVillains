Despite [[Zummi Gummi]]'s warning that Tummi acted carelessly in constructing the device, using the wrong wood, drilling too few holes, on the wrong side, and using a rope that is too long, he goes on using it anyway.\n\nZummi's warning holds true, and instead of honey bees, Tummi attracts the voracious Beevilweevils. Nothing that the [[Gummi Bears|Gummies]] attempt to stop the greedy bugs is successful, and all that ends up being left of the Gummiberry bushes are bare branches (and unbeknownst to them, some still-fertile roots).\n\nThe bears eventually travel to the deserted Gummi colony of [[South Gumton]] in order to find a sapling to replace the bushes.\n\n{{Adventures of the Gummi Bears}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Adventures of the Gummi Bears characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Insects]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]"
