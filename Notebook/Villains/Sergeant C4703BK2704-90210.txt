Featured in the pre-show, this animatronic is highly active with visitors, regarding the fact that he directly talks to them and provides directions and safety instructions. His comedic timidness makes the pre-show more welcoming and sets the attraction in a more light-hearted family environment, much opposed to S.I.R. in Alien Encounter.\n\nSgt. 90210 also makes a cameo in the mobile game ''[[Disney Magic Kingdoms]]'' as part of the game's representation of Stitch's Great Escape!.\n\n<gallery>\nBa-stitches great escape.png\n</gallery>\n\n==Notes==\n*His identity number has the numbers 90210. This is a homage to the American drama show, ''Beverly Hills 90210''.\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Police officers]]\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Magic Kingdoms characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]"
