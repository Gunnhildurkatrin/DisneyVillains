She is a white female cat who lives in the [[King's Castle]], with [[The King (Cinderella)|him]] as\u00a0her owner. She is the minor character in Disney's [[2007]] animated film ''[[Cinderella III: A Twist in Time]]''.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nPom-Pom is an arrogant, snobbish, and rude cat. She has no feelings towards anyone except herself. On the other hand, she was shown briefly attracted to [[Lucifer]] when the latter became sophisticated in an attempt to impress her, hinting she can be loving, but only when it benefits her.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nLike Lucifer, Pom-Pom is chubby. She has pure white fur as well as yellow sclerae with black pupils and purple irises. She wears a pink ribbon around her neck tied into a bow faced to the front (although in \"An Uncommon Romance\" the bow was turned to behind the neck). Pom-Pom also has a tuft of curly fur above her forehead and the tip of her tail has a similar curl. Her whiskers are curled up.\n\nIn ''[[Cinderella III: A Twist in Time]]'', Pom-Pom's fur fluffed up and wears the yellow bow on her head.\n\n==Role in the film==\nAt the beginning of the movie, Pom-Pom is asleep when [[Jaq and Gus]] pass by her to go to [[Fairy Godmother]] to read the story of Cinderella in the library. In the end, the mice carry the book to [[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]], they sneak past the female cat till she wakes up and sees them. She is about to give chase when a pie that was dropped by [[Beatrice and Daphne|Daphne]] lands on her head.\n\nIn one of the three stories, \"Tall Tail\", Pom-Pom tries to catch both Jaq and Gus whom were collecting flowers in the castle garden. Her appetite towards mice is fueled even further once [[Jaq and Gus|Jaq]] is turned into a human for a day by [[Fairy Godmother]], assuming that Jaq's new human form is made up of seven mice.\n\nIn \"An Uncommon Romance,\" she and Lucifer get together and she helps him catch the mice, but their relationship is short-lived when Pom-Pom dumps Lucifer out of spite after Jaq dumps water on her.\n\nIn ''Cinderella III: A Twist in Time'', she is seen in the portrait with the King and [[The Queen (Cinderella)|Queen]].\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Pom-Pom only chases mice, unlike Lucifer who chases ''both'' mice and birds.\n* She is named after decorative balls or tufts of fibrous material which is often used by cheerleaders.\n* Pom-Pom eating a human Jaq in \"Tall Tail\" is only a silly joke used in this film, as in real life domestic cats do not eat humans or view humans as a part of their food chain or prey in any way; only the closely-related big cats in the wild such as {{WikipediaLink|Bengal tiger}}s, Tsavo maneater {{WikipediaLink|lion}}s and {{WikipediaLink|Indian leopard}}s are known to have tried to eat humans.\n\n{{Cinderella}}\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Cinderella characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
