He is the chief of one of the departments in the police station, where the [[Rescue Rangers]] like to watch for cases.\u00a0They enjoy his office, likely because Spinelli eats a lot and likes cheese dishes (which primarily attracts [[Monterey Jack]]). As the chief of the department (which, probably investigates all kinds of loss, thefts, etc.), Spinelli has two patrol cops: [[Officer Kirby and Officer Muldoon|Muldoon and Kirby]].\n\nHe appears in the episodes \"[[Catteries Not Included]]\", \"[[The Carpetsnaggers]]\", \"[[To the Rescue]]\", \"[[Battle of the Bulge]]\", \"[[Seer No Evil]]\", \"[[Mind Your Cheese and Q's]]\", \"[[Out of Scale (Rescue Rangers episode)|Out of Scale]]\" and \"[[Dirty Rotten Diapers]].\"\n\n==Trivia==\n* [[Jim Cummings]] based Spinelli's voice on his aunt.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=180 spacing=small position=center captionalign=center>\nWallPaper1_yes.jpg\nvlcsnap-2015-08-10-12h49m12s784.png\nvlcsnap-2015-08-10-13h03m16s821.png\nvlcsnap-2015-08-10-13h03m24s721.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n{{Rescue Rangers}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Spinelli, Sergeant}}\n[[Category:Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers characters]]\n[[Category:Police officers]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
