She is married to [[Joe Robinson]] and spends her time controlling her full-sized model trains throughout the [[Anderson Observatory]]. She is voiced by Kelly Hoover.\n\n==Personality==\nLike the rest of the Robinsons, Billie is energetic and eccentric and cares deeply about her family. She likes challenging [[Gaston Framagucci]] to race her trains whenever they have spare time.\n\n==Appearances==\n===[[Meet the Robinsons]]===\nBillie first appears when [[Lewis Robinson|Lewis]] and [[Bud Robinson|Bud]] arrive to find her and [[Gaston Framagucci|Gaston]] about to race. Gaston asks Lewis to time the race, which he manages to win. Besides her full scale model train utilized in the race, Billie also has a small train used to pass trays around the dinner table. When [[Tiny the T-Rex|Tiny]] is on the attack, she utilizes her train to ram the dinosaur back outside.\n\n===[[Meet the Robinsons (video game)]]===\nIn the video game, [[Wilbur Robinson|Wilbur]] is charged early on with helping Billie restore the power-charger for her large trains. Billie also operates a monorail line that allows Wilbur to travel to different parts of the city that has a station right inside the foyer of the house.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Billie originally switched her accents constantly, before Lewis finally asks where she comes from: Cleveland.\n*It was Billie who told Lewis (and the audience) that \"from failing you learn, from success not so much.\" This may also imply to the fact that many famous people, including [[Walt Disney]], came across even many failures before they became successful.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nBillieGame.jpg|Billie in the video game\nBillie Robinson Concept Art.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Meet-the-Robinsons}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Robinson, Billie}}\n[[Category:Meet the Robinsons characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Aunts]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]"
