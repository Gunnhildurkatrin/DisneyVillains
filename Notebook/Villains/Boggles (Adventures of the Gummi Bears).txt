The boggle humors her by turning into rocks mushrooms, scarves, and jewelry in order to be kept safe. In fact, it begins to feel so safe in [[Gummi Glen]], that it sneaks out over night, in order to call for and bring its family to safety.\n\nThe small creatures make use of their powers in order to steal food from the [[Gummi Bears]], resulting not only in irritation from the Gummis, but also a far greater threat for the bears, when the wolf finds its way into Gummi Glen.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In Scottish mythology, the Boggle is a ghost or folkloric being that is the equivalent of the boogie man, or bogart in England.\n*According to Northern English mythology, the Boggle could be a derivation of the Barghest, a dog-like creature with the power of shapeshifting.\n*The Boggles bear resemblance to [[Crazy Edie]]'s gerbil-like gremlins from the ''[[TaleSpin]]'' episode \"[[The Sound and the Furry]]\", that aired a little over three years later.\n\n{{Adventures of the Gummi Bears}}\n[[Category:Adventures of the Gummi Bears characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Mystical animals]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]"
