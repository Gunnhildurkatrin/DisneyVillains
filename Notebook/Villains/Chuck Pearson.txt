"[[File:Chuck_Pearson.jpg|thumb]]\n'''Chuck Pearson''' is the father of [[Pepper Ann Pearson|Pepper Ann]] and [[Moose Pearson]] who was in a relationship with [[Lydia Pearson]] for an unspecified amount of time. He was voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]].\n\nHe is seen only in a few episodes in his entirety (\"[[Thanksgiving Dad]]\"). We know, however, that he was English, and divorced Lydia (although the two remain on good terms) when the girls were young.\n\nLydia, in turn, embraces her divorc\u00e9e, single-mom identity with great gusto, and encourages Pepper Ann to be as proudly independent as she is, although she does keep a curfew on Pepper Ann.\n\n==Episode Appearances==\n*\"[[Thanksgiving Dad]]\"\n\n{{Pepper Ann}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pearson, Chuck}}\n[[Category:Pepper Ann characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Uncles]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
