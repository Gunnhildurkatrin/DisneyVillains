The main difference is they seem to be devoted to their virility and are summoned by beef jerky. They live in the caverns of [[Gravity Falls, Oregon|Gravity Falls]] which they call the \"man caves\". They appear in the ''[[Gravity Falls]]'' episode \"[[Dipper vs. Manliness]]\".\n\n==Background==\n===Behavior===\nDue to high levels of testosterone, manotaurs are known to be stubborn, aggressive, and easy to disagree. They are easily offended by remarks regarding their manliness and will do anything to prove themselves worthy. They are feared by most of the animals of the forest and even by [[Manly Dan]].\n\nThey show carelessness towards other creatures as Chutzpar uses a buck to scratch his back hair. They tend to dislike creatures who don't act manly. Their enemy is the [[Multi-Bear]] and they seem to laugh at him because he listens to BABBA. Also they apparently can smell if you have \"emotional issues\".\n\n===Abilities===\nOther than their superhuman strength, manotaurs have a keen sense of smell. They are able to smell beef jerky and the emotional issues of young boys.\n\n==Known Manotaurs==\n<tabber>Chutzpar=\n[[File:gravityfalls_chutzpar.png|right|200px]]\n'''Chutzpar''' is the manotaur who first meets Dipper.
