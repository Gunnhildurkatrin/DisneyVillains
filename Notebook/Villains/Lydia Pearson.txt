"{{Infobox character|image=Lydia_Pearson.jpg|voice=[[April Winchell]]|children=Pepper Ann (daughter)|siblings=Janie Diggety (sister)|shows=''[[Pepper Ann]]''<br>''[[House of Mouse]]'' (cameo)}}\n'''Lydia Pearson (n\u00e9e Lilly)''' (voiced by [[April Winchell]]) is [[Pepper Ann Pearson|Pepper Ann's]] mom. Lydia is a beautiful, divorced, single working mother. She works at a fashion boutique, and makes pretty good money. Pepper Ann is usually embarrassed by her, but she sometimes surprises Peppie (as she calls her), like her connection with Mick Snot. Lydia has a sister named [[Janie Diggety]].\n\n==Trivia==\n* In \"[[P.A.'s Life in a Nutshell]]\", Lydia is revealed to have been roughly Pepper Ann's age on March 28, 1968 (12-13). Seeing as how the series is supposed to take place in 1997-98, that would mean that Lydia is roughly 41-42 years old.\n* Despite being called Lydia throughout the series, she is always listed as simply \"Mom\" in the credits.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nchar_30371_thumb.jpg\nchar_30307_thumb.jpg|\"Don't touch the [[Pete|villain]], [[Pepper Ann Pearson|dear]].\"\nPepperAnn HoM.png|Lydia Pearson and Pepper Ann with [[Pete]] in \"[[The Stolen Cartoons]]\".\nLydia.jpg\nDHOM 1x01 PetePepperLydia.png\nlydiapepperann2001.jpg\nlydiapep.jpeg\npepandlydia.jpeg\nlydia2.0.jpg|stock art\n</gallery>\n\n{{Pepper Ann}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pearson, Lydia}}\n[[Category:Pepper Ann characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Twins and Triplets]]\n[[Category:Jewish characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
