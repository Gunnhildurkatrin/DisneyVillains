"\n[[File:Drummer.png|thumb|250px|The band's drummer.]]\n'''Jeremy's unnamed drummer''' is a friend of [[Jeremy Johnson]]. He is the drummer in Jeremy's band, [[Jeremy and the Incidentals]]. He was first seen when he, along with Jeremy and the bass player, performed at the Summer Festival, during which they were briefly transformed into a punk rock version of themselves by [[Heinz Doofenshmirtz|Dr. Doofenshmirtz]]'s Ugly-inator. (\"[[The Best Lazy Day Ever]]\")\n\nHe was later seen in Candace's dream. He is at the mall with Jeremy and some friends when Jeremy laughs at Candace when she asks to go to the dance (\"[[Out to Launch (Phineas and Ferb)|Out to Launch]]\"). He is also seen in the audience of the HaHaHut, on the day Phineas and Ferb help Candace feel better. (\"[[Cheer Up Candace]]\")\n\nHe is then seen dancing in the background in \"[[Phineas and Ferb Summer Belongs to You!]]\".\n\n==Relationships==\n===Jeremy Johnson===\nHe is possibly great friends with Jeremy because he is in the same band and they have been seen at the mall hanging out together.\n\n===Coltrane===\nIt is unknown if they are friends, but they are in the same band together along with Jeremy.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In \"[[Candace Gets Busted]]\", a different drummer appears. It couldn't have been the same person because he shows up later, walking through the door.\n*He has his first speaking appearance in \"[[Does This Duckbill Make Me Look Fat?]]\".\n*In \"[[Cheer Up Candace]]\", he flips over a table because he thinks Ferb's joke is funny.\n\n==Appearances==\n*\"[[The Best Lazy Day Ever]]\" (first appearance)\n*\"[[Does This Duckbill Make Me Look Fat?]]\" (speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Out of Toon]]\"\n*\"[[Out to Launch (Phineas and Ferb)|Out to Launch]]\" (nonspeaking cameo)\n*\"[[Unfair Science Fair]]\" (nonspeaking cameo)\n*\"[[Cheer Up Candace]]\" (nonspeaking cameo)\n*\"[[Phineas and Ferb Summer Belongs to You!]]\" (nonspeaking cameo)\n*\"[[Rollercoaster: The Musical!]]\" (nonspeaking cameo)\n*\"[[Make Play]]\" (nonspeaking cameo)\n*\"[[Candace Gets Busted]]\" (nonspeaking cameo)\n*\"[[Run, Candace, Run]]\"\n*\"[[Phineas' Birthday Clip-O-Rama!]]\" (nonspeaking cameo)\n*\"[[Ferb Latin]]\" (nonspeaking cameo)\n\n{{Phineas and Ferb}}\n{{PF-Wiki}}\n[[Category:Phineas and Ferb characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
