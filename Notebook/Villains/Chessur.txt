He is a cheshire cat with evaporating and shapeshifting skills, a sarcastic and slightly dark personality, and a stealthy attitude.\n\n==Background==\nChessur is a Cheshire cat who possesses the ability to freely appear and disappear. He is always calm, with a seductive grin. It is his disembodied head that first appears to [[Alice Kingsleigh]] in the Tulgey Wood after she's been attacked by the vicious [[Bandersnatch]]. He offers to purify the gashes on her arm by licking them. Alice declines, although she allows him to lead her to [[Thackery Earwicket|Thackery]], [[Mallymkun|Mally]] and [[Tarrant Hightopp|Tarrant]]'s tea party. However, the Hatter is not happy to see him because he blames Chessur for deserting them on the day the [[Red Queen]] seized control of [[Underland]]. Using his skills and the Hatter's coveted top hat, the Cheshire Cat later finds a way to redeem himself.\n\n===Personality===\nChessur is a witty, sometimes smug and sarcastic, cheshire cat with a slightly dark, grim and creepy personality, and a stealthy attitude. He is also slightly coward: When a situation turns bad or dangerous, he has the habit of evaporating away. That personality trait, in particular, created a rift between him and Tarrant. However, it also should be noted that Chessur can be compassionate and helpful if he wants to. He helped Alice many times and even saved Tarrant's life by shapeshifting into him once.\n\n===Physical Appearance===\nChessur is a cheshire cat with a long grey fur with light blue stripes, big turquoise eyes and razor sharp pointy teeth. \n\n===Powers and Abilities===\nChessur's skills of evaporating, floating and shapeshifting are his most well-known characteristics. He is able to completely dissolve his body, or just a part of it, when he wants to. Indeed, one of his most common poses is making just his head appear, like there is no body, or making just his eyes and teeth appear, like there is no head. He is also able to freely float in the air, a skill he is particularly fond of given that he uses it almost every time and everywhere. Even when there is no need to float, like when he is close to a chair or a bench, Chessur prefers to do it instead of sitting. Last but not least, he has the ability to shapeshift his body to any form he wants to, no matter the size of his new shape. This was very utile, for example, when he saved the life of Tarrant Hightopp in [[The Red Queen's Castle|Salazen Grum]] by shapeshifting into him, even being able to create his clothes and perfectly imitating his walk.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''===\nAfter Alice gets lost in the forest because of the Bandersnatch attack, Chessur finds her and offers to purify the claw marks on her arm, but she declines, allowing him to just wrap it with a piece of cloth. He then helps Alice by guiding her to Tarrant, Mally and Thackery's tea party. Tarrant is not happy to see him, accusing him of betraying them by evaporating away during the attack of [[Underland#Witzend|Witzend]] during the Horunvendush Day (the day the Red Queen took control of Underland using the [[Jabberwocky (2010)|Jabberwocky]]). Chessur denies that the tragedy caused by the Jabberwocky was his fault, but he is yelled at and insulted by the Hatter, until Mally intervenes. When the [[Knave of Hearts|the Knave of Hearts]], [[Bayard]], and the [[Armoured Cards]] approach, he evaporates away. Later on, he helps Tarrant during his execution by sparing his life, taking his place while wearing the Mad Hatter's hat and vanishing before he is executed. Although he had always wanted Tarrant's hat, he appears later in [[The White Queen's Castle|the White Queen's Castle]] and returns it to its owner. He is later seen in the Frabjous Day, witnessing the final battle between Alice and the Jabberwocky. He is last seen grinning at Alice before she drinks the Jabberwocky blood to return to [[London]].\n\n===''[[Alice Through the Looking Glass]]''===\nChessur returns in this sequel.\n\nAfter Alice returns to Underland, Chessur informs her about the situation with Tarrant. Later, he accompanies her with the others to the clock which leads Alice to [[Time]]. After Alice goes back in time, she encounters Chessur as a kitten, at this point still learning how to evaporate. Later, when time starts to rust, Chessur joins the others for their eventual death. When time goes back to normal after Alice returns the [[Chronosphere]] to the clock, he is seen with the others as Alice returns to London as a farewell.\n\n==Video games==\n===''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 video game)|Alice in Wonderland]]''===\nChessur appears in the video game adaptations of the film. He is a playable character in all the three versions of the game, the Wii, PC and DS. His main ability is invisibility, in which he makes targeted objects hidden or reveals invisible objects. [[Stephen Fry]] reprises his role from the film.\n\n===''[[Disney Universe]]''===\n[[File:Chessur DU Render.png|150px|right]]\nChessur appears as a costume in ''Disney Universe''. His costume is automatically unlocked and purchased right at the very start of the game, so it can be worn by the players immediately upon the beginning of the gameplay. That also makes him the first costume to be unlocked in the ''Alice in Wonderland'' pack. When using the Chessur costume, players can use mushrooms to strike enemies. He begins with a brown mushroom and changes to a blue mushroom upon upgrade. After a subsequent upgrade, he fights with a fiddlehead fern. Finally, when fully upgraded, he uses a red mushroom with white spots.\n\n===''[[Disney Infinity (series)|Disney Infinity]]''===\n{{Quote|Chessur, now!|Alice summoning Chessur in her combo finisher}}\nChessur makes a cameo in ''[[Disney Infinity: 3.0 Edition|Disney Infinity 3.0]]'', appearing in Alice's combo finisher. He can suck enemies in her range and blast them away.\n\n==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==\n===[[Shanghai Disneyland]]===\n[[File:Alice in wonderland maze shanghai 03.jpg|thumb|200px|Art from the Alice in Wonderland Maze attraction.]]\nChessur appears in the attraction [[Alice in Wonderland Maze]] in Shanghai Disneyland, [[China]]. Guests are able to find him in the maze if they choose the right path, and then witness him floating before their eyes, then disappearing in clouds of smoke\u2014all while he offers amusing advice.\n\n==Relationships==\n===[[Alice Kingsleigh]]===\n{{Q|I'll take you to the Hare and the Hatter, but that's the end of it.|Chessur after finding Alice in the forest}}\nDuring Alice's first trip to Underland, when she was only six years old, Chessur found her in the forest and took her to Tarrant, Thackery and Mally's tea party. The exact same situation happened during Alice's second trip to Underland, when she was 19 years old.\n\n===[[Tarrant Hightopp]]===\n{{Q|You ran out on them to save your own skin, you guddler's scuttish pilgar lickering shukm juggling sluking urpal.|The Hatter insulting Chessur for disappearing during the invasion of Witzend}}\n[[File:Tim Burtons Alice in Wonderland 44.jpg|thumb|200px|Chessur and Tarrant in Salazen Grum's dungeon.]]\nChessur and Tarrant relationship was shattered on the Horunvendush Day (the day the Red Queen took control of Underland using the Jabberwocky), due to Chessur evaporating away from the destruction of [[Underland#Witzend|Witzend]] and thus not helping Tarrant's family, the Hightopps, resulting in their supposed death. Chessur maintained that his actions were not responsible for the demise of the Hightopps, as the only ones to blame were the Red Queen and the Jabberwocky themselves, but Tarrant took a hard time in accepting this. Eventually, however, they were able to make amends when Chessur saved Tarrant's life in Salazen Grum by shapeshifting into him, thus avoiding the real Tarrant of being beheaded.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nCheshireCat.jpg\nCheshire Cat Tim Burton.jpg\n'Alice_in_Wonderland'_Trailer_5_0021.jpg\nChes1.jpg\nChes2.jpg\nChes4.jpg\nChes5.jpg\nAlice-disneyscreencaps.com-3399.jpg\nChessur DU Render.png|Chessur costume in [[Disney Universe]]\nChessur.png\nAlice in wonderland finale.jpg\nAlice Through the Looking Glass replicas.png\n_7d198f90-83d9-11e5-8fe0-54c761f0e0c7.jpg\nAlice Through The Looking Glass! 113.png\nAlice Through The Looking Glass! 118.png\nCheshire-Cat-POP.jpg|Chessur [[Funko|Funko POP!]] figure\nKittenChessurFunko.jpg|Kitten Chessur Funko POP! figure\nChessur dorbz.jpg\nChessur dorbz chase variant.jpg\nFunko Pop Books a Million Exclusive Glow in the Dark Chessur.jpg\ncat Cheshire.jpg\nkitty Cheshire.jpg\nMad Hatter and cat.jpg\nAlice in Wonderland - Table.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Alice in Wonderland}}\n{{Disney Infinity}}\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Disney Universe Suits]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Disney Infinity characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Crossy Road characters]]"
