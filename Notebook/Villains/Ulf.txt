He dreams of becoming a professional mime.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Tangled]]''===\nUlf is first seen at the Snuggly Duckling pub during the song \"I've Got a Dream\". Later on, Ulf assists some of the other major thugs in their mission to rescue Flynn Rider from prison so that he may rescue Rapunzel from the villain Mother Gothel. Ulf is last seen at the end of the film acting as a mime in front of the crowd (although everyone is bewildered by the act); Flynn remarks that he assumes that Ulf is happy, as he never told him otherwise.\n===''[[Tangled Ever After]]''===\nIn ''Tangled Ever After'', Ulf can be seen at the wedding ceremony sitting alongside the other thugs.\n===''[[Tangled: Before Ever After]]''===\nUlf is seen in [[Corona Castle]] during Eugene's verse of \"[[Life After Happily Ever After]]. He, along with most of the main thugs, appears to have become one of Eugene's closest companions outside of Rapunzel and Maximus.\n\n===''[[Tangled: The Series]]''===\nIn \"[[What the Hair?!]]\", Ulf appears in the castle after Eugene explains that one of the guards is terrified of mimes (as they see things that aren't there). He later shows up at the Snuggly Duckling eating an invisible sandwich.\n\nIn \"[[Painter's Block]]\", Ulf was one of many of Corona's local artists to fall victim to [[Mrs. Sugarby]]'s plot to free her master, Zhan Tiri. Fortunately, he and the others were saved by Rapunzel, Eugene, and [[Cassandra (Tangled)|Cassandra]].\n\nIn \"[[Rapunzel's Return]]\", Ulf arrives at [[the Dark Kingdom]] via hot air balloon, locating Rapunzel and her party. With Shorty translating for him, Ulf explains that Corona had been taken over by foreign invaders, so he followed the trail of the [[Black Rocks|black rocks]] to find his friends. Immediately, they set off for Corona.\n\nUpon their arrival, they find the kingdom deserted, save for [[Feldspar]], who claimed the people were forced to slave in the quarries to mine green crystals. It turned out that Shorty omitted this crucial piece of information from Ulf's story.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Ulf is the only one of the major [[Pub Thugs]] without a speaking role.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\">\n9 67.0034small.jpg\nUlfTangled.png\nPubThugTangled.png\nThe-Wrath-of-Ruthless-Ruth-3.png\nRapunzel's Return 01.jpg\nThe King and Queen of Hearts (43).jpg\nFlynnpostor (9).jpg\nRapunzel's Return (95).jpg\nDVG Ulf.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Tangled}}\n{{Disney Crossy Road}}\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Tangled characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Crossy Road characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
