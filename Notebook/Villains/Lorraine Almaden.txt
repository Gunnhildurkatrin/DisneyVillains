She wears an olive green shirt with a blue collar, three horizontal stripes that extended around the shirt, from front to back, on top of one another in colors that are in order of blue-white-blue, jeans, and red, and white sneakers.\n\n\n== Nappers Never Sleep ==\n\nShe has a stand-out role in\u00a0Nappers Never Sleep. In this, she befriended a boy from X named\u00a0[[Everett Konquist]], who also happens to be her neighbor. Everett gradually works his way to opening up to making friends and spending more time with real people instead of always playing with his digital pet,\u00a0Duappy. When Duappy goes missing, [[Cornelius Fillmore|Fillmore]]\u00a0and\u00a0[http://disneyfillmore.wikia.com/wiki/Ingrid_Third Ingrid]\u00a0look into it. When they head to Lorraine's house looking for her, her father,\u00a0Mr. Almaden, tells them that she's not there at the moment, so they ask him some questions. When the two Safety Patrollers go to her place again after learning that she's the first of the two suspects who kidnapped Duappy and Lorraine returns, they chase after her as she flees. When she is caught, the three of them are in her room and she explains her reasons for doing what she did. She tells them about how she used to be close to another schoolmate,\u00a0[[Biana Bully]], even joining her on the cheerleading squad for a while. After quitting the squad and since spending more time with Everett, she hints at how she's developed feelings for him. It seems that she and Biana drifted apart. Lorraine talks about how he was doing so well socializing with someone real rather than using an electronic device and figures that he could do so much better than that. When she's brought in for questioning once again, this time into the school's interrogation room, she feels sorry about what she'd done, regrets it and is remorseful. When Everett finds out that it was her who took Duappy, he isn't so forgiving nor charitable. But Fillmore tells him that she made a mistake and everyone deserves a second chance. Near the end of the episode, Everett has made up with Lorraine, they're now on good terms and he tries to offer Duappy to Fillmore.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n{{Fillmore!}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Almaden, Lorraine}}\n[[Category:Fillmore characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Cheerleaders]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]"
