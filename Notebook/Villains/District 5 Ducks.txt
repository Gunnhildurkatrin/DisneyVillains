"[[File:Mighty_Ducks_Logo.jpg|thumb|275px]]The '''District 5 Ducks''' are a Minneapolis PeeWee hockey team. They are featured in the movies ''[[The Mighty Ducks]]'' and ''[[D2: The Mighty Ducks]]''.\n==History==\nThey are a team with no coach or structure and they have little equipment. When [[Gordon Bombay]] is arrested for drunk driving, he is sentenced to 500 hours of community service by coaching the ragtag team. When Bombay meets the team, he realizes the kids have no practice facility, equipment, or ability to go with it.\n\nThe team's first game with Bombay at the helm is against Bombay's old team: the Hawks. Reilly is still head coach and remains bitter about Gordon's shortcoming in that fateful game. District 5 gets pummeled and after Bombay berates the team for not listening to him, the players challenge his authority.\n\nBombay approaches his boss, [[Gerald Ducksworth]], to sponsor the team, which Ducksworth reluctantly agrees. The result is a complete makeover for the team, both in look (as they can now buy professional equipment) and in skill (as Bombay has more time to teach the kids hockey fundamentals). Now playing as the \"Ducks\", they fight to a tie in the next game and recruit three new players: figure-skating siblings [[Tommy Duncan|Tommy]] and [[Tammy Duncan]] and slap shot specialist and enforcer [[Fulton Reed]]. The potential of Ducks player [[Charlie Conway]] catches Bombay's eye and he takes him under his wing.\n\nBombay learns that star player for the Hawks, [[Adam Banks]], actually resides in the Ducks' district boundaries and threatens Reilly into transferring Banks to the Ducks. Ducksworth makes a deal with Reilly about the Hawks keeping Banks, however, Bombay refuses since it would be against fair-play, which Ducksworth berated him about when he started his community service. Left with either the choice of letting his team down or get fired from his job, Bombay takes the latter.\n\nAdam Banks proves to be a valuable asset. The Ducks manage to make it to the championship against the Hawks. Despite the Hawks' heavy attacks taking Banks out of the game, the Ducks manage to score a tie and earn a penalty shot in the final seconds of the game. Bombay encourages Charlie to take the shot, reassuring him that even if he fails it will be alright. Charlie manages to score a goal using a technique Gordon taught him.\n\n==Roster==\n\n\n*00 - [[Guy Germaine]]\n*01 - [[Terry Hall]]\n*02 - [[Tommy Duncan]]\n*04 - [[Lester Averman]]\n*05 - [[Tammy Duncan]]\n*09 - [[Jesse Hall]]\n*11 - [[Dave Karp]]\n*18 - [[Connie Moreau]]\n*24 - [[Peter Mark]]\n*33 - [[Greg Goldberg]]\n*44 - [[Fulton Reed]]\n*96 - [[Charlie Conway]]\n*99 - [[Adam Banks]]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery captionalign=\"left\">\nDucks Jersy.jpg|Jersey\n</gallery>\n{{The Mighty Ducks}}\n[[Category:Sports teams]]\n[[Category:The Mighty Ducks]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:The Mighty Ducks characters]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]"
