'''Experiment 007''' and '''Yapper''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]]. She is designed to sit, lie down, fetch, and annoy Jumba's neighbors with her shrill bark. Her one true place is with [[Mertle Edmonds|Mertle]]\u00a0as her pet.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nWhile Gigi fulfills the purpose she was programmed for, which was to annoy people with her constant barking, this is not a defining feature of herself. Most of the time, she is well-behaved and\u00a0appears to look and act like a normal dog: barking, fetching, and listening to orders. She can be distinguished from a real dog by her ability to talk. She is quite affectionate to those she likes, licking Mertle's face and complimenting [[Clip]] on cutting a [[Leroy]]\u00a0[[Leroy Clones|clone]]'s fur off. She is also loyal and brave, pushing Mertle out of the way of a plasma blast. She holds the ideal of family and [[Pelekai \u02bbohana|''\u02bbohana'']]\u00a0very close, having convinced Mertle (albeit somewhat reluctantly) to join [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]]'s ''\u02bbohana'' because she wanted to be in it as well, and seems to get along well with her cousins.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nGigi is a quadrupedal, white Shih Tzu-like experiment with a purple bow, solid black eyes, and a little black nose. Jumba, however, mentions that she is hard to recognize after \"so many groomings and much ribbons,\" implying that her natural appearance is somewhat different, which may also explain why she looks less alien-like than most of the other known experiments.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nGigi has an annoying shrill bark and the typical abilities of a common dog, such as sitting, fetching, and licking her owner's face. She can also speak fluently\u00a0very well as seen in ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment 007 was the 7th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Jacques von H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. She was designed to behave like a typical \"good dog\" and annoy Jumba's neighbors with her constant yapping. 007 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.\n\nAt an unknown point, Experiment 007 was activated and then later found by [[Mertle Edmonds|Mertle]], who named her Gigi.\n\nIn \"[[Yapper]]\", Mertle showed Gigi off to [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Stitch]], and then revealed that she was entering her in a dog show contest in [[Honolulu]]. However, when Gigi's yapping began to annoy Stitch, the latter swallowed her whole. Mertle screamed in horror until Lilo pulled Gigi out of Stitch's stomach and gave her back. Enraged, Mertle called\u00a0Lilo and Stitch \"riffraff\" and took Gigi, now covered in slobber, to a pet salon to get her cleaned up.\n\nWanting to win Mertle's friendship by beating her Gigi in a sensible contest, Lilo traveled via limousine to Honolulu with [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] and [[Pleakley]]. There, she entered Stitch in the same dog show, claiming he was a rare blue-furred ectoplasmic detection dog to impress [[Mitzi Suzuki and Kato Stewart|the judges]].\n\nLilo and Mertle engaged in an unfriendly rivalry then\u00a0entered their \"dogs\" into all the competitions, which took place the next day. However, both Stitch's temper (when he fought with a contestant's dog after the latter sniffed him) and overconfidence caused him to lose the first two rounds. In the final competition, Mertle secretly gave Stitch extra strong coffee to make the latter go crazy so that Gigi would win.\n\nMertle's plan was successful at first, but then\u00a0[[Captain Gantu|Gantu]]\u00a0suddenly burst into the premises searching for her \"dog\". Stitch impulsively attacked Gantu, who fired his plasma gun uncontrollably, but a stray plasma blast caused the ceiling to collapse on top of Stitch. Gantu then took Gigi from a terrified Mertle, after which she complained to Lilo.\n\nBecause Gigi was Stitch's cousin, Lilo promised to save her from Gantu. She then gave Stitch more coffee intentionally, enabling the latter to defeat Gantu and get Gigi back safe and sound.\n\nGrateful but indignant, Mertle gave the \"Best in Show\" trophy to Lilo. However, when\u00a0Lilo\u00a0saw how much Mertle truly cared for Gigi, the former decided to leave Gigi with Mertle.\n\nGigi reappeared in \"[[Amnesio (episode)|Amnesio]]\", being accompanied by Mertle and [[Elena, Teresa, and Yuki|the hula girls]] while Lilo attempted to invite them to her birthday party.\n\nIn \"[[PJ (episode)|PJ]]\", Gigi and a couple of regular dogs attacked Lilo's substitute teacher wearing squeaky shoes shaped like dog biscuits, which was one of [[PJ (Lilo & Stitch)|PJ]]'s many pranks.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nGigi was seen being walked by [[Mertle Edmonds|Mertle]], the latter stopping to taunt Lilo before moving on.\n\nLater, the first 624 experiments, including Gigi along with Mertle, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]], and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nDuring the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]], Mertle with Gigi tried to avoid attacking Leroys. When Mertle and Gigi were both saved from a Leroy clone by [[Clip]], Gigi revealed her ability to speak (surprising Mertle) and her status as an experiment, then pushed Mertle out of the way of a Leroy's plasma blast.\n\nThe Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle\u00a0but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.\n\nFollowing the battle, Gigi declared that she wanted to be part of Lilo's ''\u02bbohana'', convincing Mertle to join it with Gigi.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink|Gigi/Gallery}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Gigi was first revealed in a DVD bonus feature of ''[[Stitch! The Movie]]'' in the experiment gallery.\n*Gigi was activated off-screen.\n*Gigi, along with [[Nosox]], [[Richter]], Butter, [[Splodyhead]], [[Tank (Lilo & Stitch)|Tank]], [[Shortstuff]], [[Yang]], [[Spike (Lilo & Stitch)|Spike]], [[Phoon]], and one unconfirmed experiment, are the only known experiments that are primarily quadrupeds.\n*Gigi is one of the ten known experiments named by someone other than Lilo, the other nine being [[Elastico]], [[Yaarp]], [[Hammerface]], [[Heat]], [[Thresher]], [[Plasmoid]], [[Morpholomew]], [[Shrink]], and [[Leroy]].\n**She is also one of the six known experiments to be rehabilitated by someone other than Lilo and Stitch, the other five being Elastico, Yaarp, Spike, [[Frenchfry]], and [[Snooty]].\n*Her episode is named \"[[Yapper]]\" after the nickname Lilo gave her, but \"Gigi\", the name Mertle gave her, is her official name on the experiment name list in ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''.\n*Her number is a reference to the code number of the legendary {{WikipediaLink|James Bond (literary character)|James Bond}}. This could very well be a coincidence, though Gigi does share one similarity with James Bond: she is an alien undercover as a dog.\n*Gigi never spoke in ''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''. However, during the climax of ''Leroy & Stitch'', it is revealed that she can speak fluently very well and says to [[Clip]], \"Nice one, cousin,\" after seeing Clip cut a Leroy clone's fur off. She then says to Mertle, \"Look out!\" and pushes her out of the way of another Leroy clone's plasma blast.\n*Mertle adopting Gigi at the animal shelter mirrors the relationship between Lilo and Stitch, as Mertle didn't know Gigi is a genetic experiment until she found in ''Leroy & Stitch''.\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
