Skeeter is [[Doug Funnie|Doug]]'s lanky best friend. He is famous in both series for the honking sounds he frequently makes. Skeeter's family has lived in Bluffington for some time. Skeeter initially helps Doug order food from the popular Bluffington restaurant Honker Burger (sold and converted into a French restaurant in the second series) in the series premiere (resulting in their friendship), and later helps Doug learn how to dance. He had dated [[Beebe Bluff]], [[Muffy Silverson]], and Loretta. Skeeter also seems to be more down to earth and has more common sense than Doug or any of the other characters and is usually the voice of reason. He has a superhero alter-ego, whom he calls \"The Silver Skeeter\".\u00a0Skeeter's voice and noises are provided by [[Fred Newman]] of ''Between the Lions''.\n\n==Appearance==\n\nSkeeter is blue-skinned and has a few hairs on his scalp. In Nickelodeon's ''Doug'', he wore a T-shirt with a lightning bolt and yellow shorts with red spots. In ''Disney's Doug'', he wore a purple open vest, a long sleeve shirt with a yellow zero, and the same shorts and red sneakers.\n\n==Trivia==\n* In \"Oh Baby\", ''Doug Live!'', and ''[[Doug's 1st Movie]]'' (as well as the original series episode \"Doug's Worst Nightmare\"), the characters refer to him being blue. He is also the only character to be referred to being technicolored.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nDoug's Last Birthday (3).jpg|Skeeter in his original outfit in \"Doug's Last Birthday\"\nSilverSkeeter.jpg|Skeeter as \"Silver Skeeter\"\nchar_33051_thumb.jpg\nSkeeter.png\nDoug's Big Comeback.jpg\nDoug's Chubby Buddy (4).jpg\nDoug Cut School (6).jpg\nSkeeter_and_Doug_05.jpg\nDoug_and_skeeter_handshake.jpg\nDoug's Last Birthday (20).jpg|Skeeter in his original design.\nDoug and the Bluffington 5 (12).jpg\nDisney Adventure -Doug.jpg\nChar 30562.jpg\nDoug's Older Woman (12).jpg\nDoug's First Movie (5).jpg\nDoug's Chubby Buddy (15).jpg\nDoug Skeeter high five Disney intro.jpg\nBeebe Skeeter ready dance.jpg\nSkeeter Valentine POP.png\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n<references />{{DEFAULTSORT:Valentine, Skeeter}}\n\n{{Doug}}\n[[Category:Doug characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Superheroes]]\n[[Category:Scouts]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
