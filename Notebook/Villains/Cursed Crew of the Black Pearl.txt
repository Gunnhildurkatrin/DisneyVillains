They tried to take over the HMS ''Dauntless'' ship but after [[Jack Sparrow]] used his blood via cutting his hand and the last piece of the Aztec gold to lift the curse. The cursed crew became mortal again and arrested by [[James Norrington]] and his men. Most of Barbossa's crewmen were presumably hung at the gallows. However, only Pintel and Ragetti had survived and escaped.\n\n===Members===\n*[[Hector Barbossa]] (captain)\n**[[Jack the Monkey]] (Barbossa's pet)\n*[[Bootstrap Bill Turner]]\n*[[Pintel and Ragetti]]\n*[[Bo'sun]]\n*[[Jacoby]]\n*[[Koehler]]\n*[[Twigg]]\n*[[Weatherby]]\n*Grapple\n*Mallot\n*Scratch\n*Monk\n*Clubba\n*Maximo\n*Dog Ear\n*Nipperkin\n*Simbakka\n*Scarus\n*Hawksmoor\n*Katracho\n*Ketchum\n\n==Disney Parks==\n\n===[[Pirate's Lair on Tom Sawyer Island]]===\nThree cursed crew-mates appear in this attraction at [[Disneyland]] within Dead Man's Grotto. Firstly, an undead Pintel and Ragetti can be found within a treasure alcove where they protect their treasure. They can be heard talking with one another about scaring off guests with Pintel popping his head out and Ragetti' arm popping down to use his eyeball to spy on guests. Near the end of the grotto, another cursed pirate can be seen in shackles within a cell where he pleads with guests to free him. When the moon comes out in this scene, it reveals his cursed form.\n\n===[[Fantasmic!]]===\nThe crew appears as minor antagonists in a Curse of the Black Pearl inspired scene found in Disneyland's Fantasmic!. They sail the Black Pearl ([[Sailing Ship Columbia]]) and fight Jack Sparrow while having [[Elizabeth Swann]] captive. They are ultimately defeated by the pair who commander the Pearl for themselves.\n\n==Gallery==\n<Gallery>\nPirates1-disneyscreencaps.com-7149.jpg|<br>The Black Pearl crew members under the curse of the Aztec gold.\n</Gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*[http://pirates.fandom.com/wiki/Cursed_crew Cursed Crew] on [http://pirates.fandom.com/wiki/ Pirates of the Caribbean Wiki].\n\n{{Pirates of the Caribbean}}\n[[Category:Skeletons]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Curses]]\n[[Category:Immortal]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Pirates of the Caribbean characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Sailors]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Fantasmic characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Presumably Deceased characters]]"
