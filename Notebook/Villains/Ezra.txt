He was the mansion's footman prior to his death.\n\n==Personality==\nEzra is a cowardly and neurotic, but still loyal, yet bumbling ghost footman who worries about getting into trouble and facing Ramsley's wrath.\n\n==Role in the film==\nIn the film, Ezra is one of the minor characters who help out [[Jim Evers]] to dispel the mansion's curse. He first happens upon [[Michael Evers|Michael]] and [[Megan Evers|Megan]] after they follow a ghostly orb up to the attic. He tells them they aren't supposed to be in the attic when Emma comes along carrying a tray of cookies.\n\n==Trivia==\n*His line \"there's always...my way,\" comes from [[The Haunted Mansion (Disneyland)|the Haunted Mansion ride]] when the narrator points out there's no way out of the gallery room, except for his way.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nInconceivable-hm.jpg|\"What are you doing here?
