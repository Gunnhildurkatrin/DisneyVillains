He's made only one animated appearance from [[1935]]'s ''[[The Golden Touch]].''\n\n==Movie appearances==\n===''[[The Golden Touch]]''===\nKing Midas was counting his gold coins until he notices the audience and told them that he wishes that everything he touches would turn into gold because he loves gold. After he made the wish, Goldy, a little elf, appeared. Seeing how Goldy can turn his cat into gold, King Midas excitedly offered to trade his gold and his kingdom for the golden touch. Goldy, however, turned down the offer and warned King Midas that the golden touch is also a golden curse. King Midas laughed at Goldy and kept demanding for the golden touch. Goldy reluctantly bestowed the gift to him and left. King Midas enjoyed the gift at first by turning flowers, fountains, statues, and one of his teeth into gold. However, when he tried to enjoy his meal, every food he touched turned into gold. Fearing that he'll starve to death, he called for Goldy to take back the golden touch. Goldy appeared and made fun of the king for being greedy. Midas offered to trade his gold, the golden touch, and his kingdom for a hamburger sandwich. Goldy agreed to the deal and took everything from King Midas (except his undergarments). A can replaced the crown on Midas' head. A hamburger with onions appeared in front of him and, after checking if it doesn't turn to gold by touching it, he ate it wholeheartedly.\n\n===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===\nAt some point in his life, King Midas acquires the ability to turn anything he touches with his right hand into gold. It is currently unknown how he came to possess this\u00a0power. To keep himself from turning people into gold, he wears special gloves that suppress his golden touch. An unknown amount of time after he acquires this power, Midas is attacked by thieves while traveling. He is saved by a knight,\u00a0[[Frederick]], to whom his daughter\u00a0[[Princess Abigail|Abigail]]\u00a0is betrothed. Unfortunately, Midas accidentally touches Frederick during the encounter, turning the young man into gold.\n\nSometime later, when\u00a0[[King George]]'s kingdom is in need of gold, he seeks to make a deal with King Midas. George has his son,\u00a0[[Prince James (Once Upon a Time)|Prince James]], duel a tough\u00a0opponent, whom he apparently slays. Pleased, Midas strikes a deal with George; if James can defeat the\u00a0dragon\u00a0plaguing his kingdom, Midas will bestow riches upon theirs. Once James agrees to fight a dragon for him, Midas turns his sword into gold and departs. Unknown to Midas, James is then killed and his\u00a0[[The Prince#Once Upon a Time|twin]],\u00a0takes his place. After the twin slays the dragon, Midas collects the dragon's head and offers the Prince his daughter's hand in marriage. King George and the prince accept, and Midas is pleased with the joining of the two kingdoms.\n\n==Printed material==\n===''Disney [[Donald Duck|Duck]] comics in general (Magica De Spell's obsession)''===\nIn her original version as created by [[Carl Barks]]<span style=\"font-size:13px;line-height:1.5em;\">, the witch\u00a0</span>[[Magica De Spell]]\u00a0wants to steal\u00a0[[Scrooge McDuck]]'s lucky n\u00b01 dime because she discovered a spell that would allow her to gain the Midas touch, using the first coin ever earned by the richest person of all times.\u00a0Author [[Don Rosa|Keno Don Rosa]]\u00a0created a story entitled\u00a0''The Treasury of Cr\u0153sus'', in which Scrooge discovers that the same spell was already purchased in ancient times by\u00a0[[Circe (DuckTales)|Circe]], who wanted to steal Cr\u0153sus's first coin for the same purpose. This motivation remained unchanged in the comics to this day, but\u00a0''[[DuckTales]]'' changed Magica's motivation, by saying that owning Scrooge's first dime would allow her to cast a spell on herself that would give her phenomenal powers, making her the most powerful sorceress in the world (that would also make her able to turn back into a duck her brother\u00a0[[Poe De Spell|Poe]], accidentally turned into a raven).\n\n===''Uncle Scrooge and King Midas's goldmaking ram''===\nIn the Italian comic story ''Zio Paperone e il caprone aurifero di Re Mida\u00a0'' (''Uncle Scrooge and King Midas's goldmaking ram,'' I.N.D.U.C.K.S. code [http://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=I+TL+1839-A I TL 1839-A]), Scrooge is told in a dream by King Midas's ghost a way to gain his power: to be hit by the magical ram on which, a long time ago, grew the Golden Fleecing. Whether King Midas is meant to have won ''his'' golden touch that way or in the classical mythological way, though, is left unconfirmed\n\n\n[[File:Hr-3..jpeg|right|120px]]\n\n===''A Very Goofy King Midas''===\nIn this 1980 comic story written for the Disney Foreign Market but eventually published back in the U.S. in the twentieth issue\u00a0''Donald and Mickey,\u00a0''in 1993,\u00a0[[Goofy]]\u00a0is featured as King Midas in a nonsensical, surrealistic version of the myth in which the fourth wall is broken so many times that you come to wonder if there is one at all.\u00a0[[Mickey Mouse]]\u00a0serves as his advisor, and his golden-touch gift is given to him by Olympian god\u00a0[[Bacchus (Fantasia)|Bacchus]], here played by\u00a0[[Pete|Peg-Leg Pete]].\u00a0\n\n== Gallery ==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n{{Once Upon a Time}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Midas, King}}\n[[Category:Silly Symphonies characters]]\n[[Category:Kings]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Once Upon a Time characters]]\n[[Category:Greek Mythology]]\n[[Category:Greek characters]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:The Three Caballeros characters]]"
