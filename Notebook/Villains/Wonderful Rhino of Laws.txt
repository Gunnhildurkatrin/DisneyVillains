He appeared in the episode \"[[The Law of the Jungle]]\".\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nBeing a judge, the rhino is very strict, serious, and judgmental. As he is in absolute power, he likes to make up new laws for the jungle anytime he feels like (which may explain why the stick [[Timon]] used to scratch his back is forbidden), making the [[The Vulture Police|vulture police]] find his way with the law funny.\n\nThe rhino gives Timon various tests in order to prove his guilt or innocence. Each time Timon succeeds in a certain test, he comes up with another one in order to know for sure if the meerkat is innocent.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nThe Wonderful Rhino of Laws is green skinned rhino with a grayish-black horn. He has black eyes with yellow sclerae. Additionally, he wears a black robe. \n\n==Role in the series==\nAfter catching Timon touching the Forbidden Stick, the Vulture Police take Timon to a the Wonderful Rhino of Laws. The vultures tell the rhino that Timon used the Forbidden Stick to scratch his back and the rhino throws the Book of Laws to throw at the meerkat for him to read.\n\nWhen [[Pumbaa]] tells Timon that he has no respect for the law, Timon then complains to everyone about the law of touching the stick, saying that it is a mockery of justice. The meerkat then breaks the stick, much to Pumbaa and the vulture police's shock and the rhino judge's anger, with Timon suggesting that he needs a lawyer. Pumbaa becomes Timon's lawyer, but Timon says that he objects to what the warthog says and that he needs a real lawyer.\n\nThe Wonderful Rhino of Laws grabs his book and makes up an article that will give Timon a series of tests to prove if the meerkat is innocent or guilty. The rhino gives Timon five tests: surviving a snake pit, walking on hot coals, catching a huge rock labeled \"Justice\", entering the cave of pain, and the written test.\n\nAfter Timon takes the written test, the meerkat finally admits that he used the Forbidden Stick scratch his back. Timon is therefore proved to be guilty and the vultures and the rhino take him to see the different kinds of punishments that he deserves. However, the punishment is merely a slap on the wrist and that the objects the police and judge showed him were a lesson to teach him what would happen if he breaks the law.\n\nTimon learns his lesson about touching the Forbidden Stick and gets a snail to eat. When Timon has trouble chewing on the snail, he asks Pumbaa to bring him a rock to break the snail's shell. Pumbaa says that it's a Forbidden Rock and no one is allowed to touch it under the penalty of law, but Timon believes that nothing bad will happen. However, when Timon touches the rock, he is put in a guillotine, with Pumbaa and the vulture police hoping that Timon would completely learn his lesson about breaking the law.\n\nThe Wonderful Rhino of Laws also makes a cameo in Pumbaa's nightmare in \"[[New Guinea Pig]]\".\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nWRL 1.png\nWRL 2.png\nWRL 3.png\nWRL 4.png\nWRL 5.png\nWRL 6.png\nWRL 7.png\nWRL 8.png\nWRL 9.png\nWRL 10.png\nWRL 11.png\nWRL 12.png\nWRL 13.png\nWRL 14.png\nWRL 15.png\nWRL 16.png\nWRL 17.png\nWRL 18.png\nWRL cameo.png|The rhino judge's cameo in Pumbaa's nightmare in \"New Guinea Pig\"\n</gallery>\n\n{{TheLionKingWiki}}\n{{The Lion King}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Timon & Pumbaa characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Rhinoceroses]]\n[[Category:Judges]]"
