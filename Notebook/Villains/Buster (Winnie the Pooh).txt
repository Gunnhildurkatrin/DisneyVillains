Buster is not of any recognized breed of dog and is likely a mutt.\n\nBuster is part of the problem-solving group known as the Super Sleuths along with Darby, Pooh and [[Tigger]]. Though oftentimes he seems to be only tagging along, his nose and his curiosity have proven an asset in many of the groups' cases. Darby also loves him as a loyal companion who is fun to play with. Buster wears a red collar with a golden-colored medallion hanging off of it. When starting a case, he flips it to the other side to reveal the green question mark that is the emblem of the Sleuths.\n\n==Notable Buster Stories==\n*\"[[Buster's Ruff Day]]\" - Buster leads the Sleuths to the Sleuther Siren, apparently trying to indicate a mystery, but the others are uncertain what the problem is.\n*\"[[Buster's Bath]]\" - The Sleuths have trouble getting Buster to take a bath after he gets muddy from chasing squirrels.\n*\"[[Lumpy's Alvin Goes to Pieces]]\" - Buster unwittingly shreds [[Lumpy]]'s favorite stuffed toy, Alvin\n*\"[[Doggone Buster]]\" - [[Roo]] and Lumpy take Buster to their secret fort to play, leading the Sleuths to think that he's gone missing.\n*\"[[Buster's Buried Treasure]]\" - Buster has lost his Super Sleuth medallion.\n*\"[[Sleuth Buster]]\" - When Pooh, Tigger and Darby search for Pooh's honey in a dark cave, Buster is the only one who hears the Sleuther Siren.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nMy-friends-tigger-pooh.jpg\nDARBY-et-BUSTER.jpg\nTigger-winnie-buster-y-darby.jpg\nTigger poohfriends.jpg\nMyfrtigg6.jpg\nDarby busterscooter.gif\nMYFRIENDSTIGGERANDPOOH.jpg\nMy Friends Tigger and Pooh.jpg\nBusterhugdarby.gif\nBuster darby.png\nMy firends tigger and pooh by AZNbebop.jpg\nMy_Friends_Tigger_&amp;_Pooh_-_Buster_as_a_Super_Sleuth.jpg\napril82.gif\napril83.gif\njune2511.gif\n</gallery>\n\n{{Winnie the Pooh}}\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Winnie the Pooh characters]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Playhouse Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:My Friends Tigger and Pooh characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
