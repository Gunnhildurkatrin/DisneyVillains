While he too can be annoyed at the antics of the Plantars, he is less likely to lash out at them. He is a lot more concerned with the well being of his daughters whom he loves dearly. However, he does seem to acknowledge that they can handle themselves as he was unfazed at Maddie threatening harm on her younger sisters. It could be that he is simply used to their unusual hobbies. He was insistent on Sprig getting married to his daughter, but upon the two of them breaking it off, showed no ill will towards the matter, nor did he seem to remember or bring it up.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nHe is a blue, short frog, with a deep brow line and yellow eyes with purple pupils. He has purple stripes and dots along his back and a light-sky-blue underbelly. He often wears an apron, with several stains, dark grey pants, light brown shirt and a baker's hat.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Mr. Flour is the second character on ''[[Amphibia]]'' to have his voice actor replaced, albeit for one episode. The first one being [[Braddock]].\n\n==External links==\n*[[w:c:Amphibiapedia:Mr. Flour|Mr. Flour]] at the [[w:c:Amphibiapedia:Main Page|Amphibia Wiki]]\n{{Amphibia}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Amphibia characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Chefs]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Males]]"
