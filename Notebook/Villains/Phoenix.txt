She is the Green family dog who is loyal to [[Cricket Green]].\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nFrom the outside, Phoenix looks lazy and lethargic, but like any loyal dog, Phoenix has an obedient side. She can actually be very brave and protective of her owners who she claims (with the help of subtitles) are her own pets. While she claims to be a \"chaser of squirrels, and eater of poop\", this trait is hardly ever shown (except in \"[[Tilly's Goat]]\", when Cricket dresses up as a squirrel to distract the other dogs, Phoenix chases him, mistaking him for an actual squirrel). When something catches her fancy, she will go after it to the point of ignoring her owners. By the end of the day however, she will always come back to her owners.\n\nHowever in \"[[Animal Farm]]\", it's show that she is rather intelligent and acts as \"queen\" for the other farm animals while the Greens are away. She is shown to be a kind, fair and dedicated leader who always thinks about the wellbeing and happiness of her subjects.\n\n===Appearance===\nPhoenix is a mangy dog of unknown species who has reddish-brown fur that is scraggly. She has some loose hairs on her head and her eyes are unusually yellow.\n\n==Trivia==\n* Phoenix was given to Cricket by his mother Nancy Green and thus has a special connection to her as well.\n* Phoenix might actually be smarter than she lets on.\n\n==External links==\n*{{Interwiki|https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/countryclub9732/images/6/64/Favicon.ico|bigcitygreens|Phoenix|Big City Greens Wiki}}\n\n{{Big City Greens}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Big City Greens characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
