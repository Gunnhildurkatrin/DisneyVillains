"[[File:Avalon2.jpg|thumb|300px|Left to Right: Boudicca, Gabriel, and Ophelia]]\nThe '''Avalon Clan''' is a [[Gargoyle (creature)|gargoyle]] clan that resides on the mythical Isle of [[Avalon]], where an hour spent on the island equates to a day in the \"real\" world. It is notable that the clan includes three human members who protected the clan while still unhatched.\n\n==Background==\n===History===\nMuch like the related [[Manhattan Clan]], the Avalon Clan is an offshoot of a gargoyle clan from [[Castle Wyvern]] in [[Scotland]]. When the majority of the clan was destroyed by Vikings, the 36 gargoyle eggs in the rookery were taken away by four humans - [[Princess Katharine]], the [[Magus]], and the peasant woman Mary and her son [[Tom]]. The eggs remained protected by these humans and brought to Avalon (only Mary remained behind), where they remained and grew to adulthood. They were raised by the humans that had protected them as eggs, and were largely untouched by the outside world.\n\nTom, now the elderly Guardian of the Eggs, arrived in [[Manhattan]] searching for [[Goliath]] to see if he had been woken from his stone slumber, only to find himself arrested by officer Morgan after defeating some \"lawless ruffians\". Goliath, along with [[Elisa Maza]] and [[Bronx]], traveled with him to Avalon and helped save the clan from attack by the [[Archmage]].\n\nUnlike traditional gargoyle clans, all members of the Avalon Clan were raised by humans. Notably due to this is the fact that each member was given a name at birth, unlike most gargoyles, as naming was a human custom. Katharine gave many of the gargoyles names with angelic themes; for example, [[Gabriel (Gargoyles)|Gabriel]] and [[Angela]].\n\n==Known Members==\n===Gargoyle Members===\n*[[Angela]] (left to join the [[Manhattan Clan]])\n*[[Boudicca]]\n*[[Gabriel (Gargoyles)|Gabriel]]\n*Ophelia\n*14 unnamed, female gargoyles\n*16 unnamed, male gargoyles\n*2 unnamed, gargoyle beasts\n\n===Human Members===\n*[[Princess Katharine]]\n*[[Magus]]\n*[[Tom]]\n\n{{Gargoyles}}\n[[Category:Gargoyles clans]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Gargoyles characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Gargoyles]]"
