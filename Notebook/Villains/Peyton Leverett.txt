He finds her interesting to his filming subject and offers her a place to stay, and records in her experiences for his school project about finding a unique story in New York City.\n\nAs the film progresses, they become closer to each other. He is the one who encourages Sharpay to pursue her dreams no matter the obstacles. They initially believed that she was in turn of starring a role on Broadway, until they find out that the agents really wanted to cast her dog, Boi. Peyton encourages her to be happy for her dog.\n\nWhen Sharpay lands a job as assistant for the famous actress\u00a0[[Amber Lee Adams]], she begins to distance herself from everyone, including Peyton, whom she had promised to schedule a time for his project. Eventually, they get into an argument which ends with Peyton leaving her apartment saying he couldn't find the confident girl who knew she didn't need to work to accomplish her goals.\n\nThe night after their argument, Sharpay finds out about Amber Lee's true face and seeks comfort in Peyton. After exposing the actress's true face to the world, the agents are forced to cancel the show.\n\nHowever, just as the performers are about to leave, Peyton shows them a video of Sharpay's secret stage singing to show them what she is truly made of. After hearing her amazing voice, the agents decide to re-hire her and save the show, under the condition of Boi and\u00a0Countess\u00a0(Roger Elliston's dog) starring as Shelby on the show. Peyton encourages Sharpay to be brave and confident with her show, and they share a kiss.\n\nHe is present during the show, sitting behind Sharpay's parents.\n\n{{High School Musical}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Leverett, Peyton}}\n[[Category:High School Musical characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]"
