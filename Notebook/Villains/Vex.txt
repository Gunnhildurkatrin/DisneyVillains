She is a no-nonsense teenager living in the streets of [[Vardaros]].\n\n==Background==\n===Physical Appearance===\nVex appears to be a slender, teenage girl with black hair, pale skin, and brown eyes. Her attire consisted of long-sleeved, orange shirt, a dark reddish-brown vest over it, black gloves, black belt with a gold buckle, a layered skirt in dark red, brown, and mahogany, black leggings and black calf-high boots. Her hair is parted into two braids and she has on gold hoop earrings. After helping Quaid back on his feet, she now has a deputy badge on her vest.\n\n===Personality===\nVex doesn't appear to have a family and was born during a time in which Vardaros had been corrupted by the crime lord known as the [[The Baron|Baron]]. To get by, Vex spent the first of her teenage years operating as a loner and running an illegitimate business that specialized in blades and other weapons called \"Knives & Such\". On the surface, she is extremely antisocial and unapproachable, though she is willing to work with anyone for the sake of money. Despite her shrewd behavior, she has an untapped sense of justice\u2014which she finally embraces upon meeting Vardaros' legendary sheriff, Quaid.\n\n==Role in the [[Tangled: The Series|series]]==\nVex first appeared in \"[[Beyond the Corona Walls]]\", where she is paid by the [[The Baron|Baron]]'s henchmen to lure [[Flynn Rider|Eugene]] and his friends into a trap. Later on, Rapunzel enters the city in search of Eugene, to which Vex notices. The teenager taunts Rapunzel on her loss, angering the latter to the point of interrogation. Despite Rapunzel's threats, Vex refuses to talk. In truth, Eugene had been kidnapped by the Baron and forced into marriage with his daughter, [[Stalyan]]. Vex gets roped into catering flowers for the event and encounters Rapunzel while doing so. The princess pays Vex to sneak [[Cassandra (Tangled)|Cassandra]] and [[Hook Foot]] into the wedding, which Vex goes about successfully.\n\nIn \"[[The Return of Quaid]]\", Anthony the Weasel takes over Vardaros in place of the fallen Baron and looks to expand his reign by robbing the people for all they're worth, including Vex. This motivates Rapunzel to start an uprising, but the princess has difficulty rallying the townsfolk to fight alongside her. According to Vex, this is because Rapunzel represents everything the people in Vardaros hate. However, Eugene and [[Lance Strongbow|Lance]] note that the city was once protected by its local sheriff, [[Captain Quaid]], though he quit the job before Vex's time, leaving the Baron to rule unconditionally. This gives Rapunzel the idea to bring Quaid out of retirement. Vex\u2014knowing his whereabouts\u2014is paid to lead Rapunzel and her friends to Quaid's cottage.\n\nUpon meeting Quaid, they learn that he left his position due to the people of Vardaros refusing to help him fight against the Baron's tyranny\u2014Vex's jaded nature only reaffirms Quaid's fear that the people of Vardaros are just as cynical and uncaring as they've always been. This prompts Rapunzel to stage a robbery, orchestrated in such a way that it reestablishes Quaid as the city's hero, and give hope to the people. The mission is a success, and with Vex by his side, Quaid regains the people's trust. A celebration is later held at Quaid's cottage, where the sheriff enlists Vex to work alongside him as his deputy. Vex accepts, though she coyly tries to hide her enthusiasm.\n\nUnfortunately, Quaid comes to realize that the first robbery was merely a ruse conducted by Vex and Rapunzel, tarnishing his confidence. Quaid quits once more, leaving Vex to face the Weasel and his goons without him. Rapunzel, Eugene, Lance, Cassandra, [[Maximus]], and Hook Foot stand by her side, but they meet their match in the form of the Collector, a bounty hunter. Before the Collector can eliminate Vex, Quaid returns. He and Vex work together to defeat the Collector, forcing Weasel to retreat, and placing the city back into their hands.\n\nIn \"[[Goodbye and Goodwill]]\", Rapunzel and her friends finally make their leave of Vardaros. Vex and Quaid are there to see them off, and although Vex is seemingly apathetic about Rapunzel's departure, Quaid urges Vex to at least thank the princess for all she's done for the city. Vex does so, and upon Rapunzel's departure, she raises the new city banner created by Rapunzel.\n\nVex is last seen in a group shot at the towards the end of \"[[Plus Est En Vous]]\".\n\n==Gallery==\n===Concept art===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nThe Return of Quaid storyboards 7.png\nThe Return of Quaid storyboards 1.png\nThe Return of Quaid storyboards 2.png\n</gallery>\n\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nBeyond the Corona Walls 1.png\nBeyond the Corona Walls 4.png\nBeyond the Corona Walls 32.png\nBeyond_the_Corona_Walls_10.jpg\nThe Return of Quaid 14.jpg\nThe Return of Quaid 5.png\nThe Return of Quaid 30.jpeg\nThe Return of Quaid 6.png\nThe Return of Quaid 18.jpg\nThe Return of Quaid 7.png\nThe Return of Quaid 23.jpg\nThe Return of Quaid 20.jpg\nThe Return of Quaid 36.png\nThe Return of Quaid 22.jpg\nGoodbye and Goodwill 21.png\nGoodbye and Goodwill 22.png\nGoodbye and Goodwill 8.jpg\nGoodbye and Goodwill 32.png\nGoodbye and Goodwill 34.png\nGoodbye and Goodwill 12.jpg\nGoodbye and Goodwill 13.jpg\nGoodbye and Goodwill 74.png\nGoodbye and Goodwill 77.png\nGoodbye and Goodwill 90.png\nGoodbye and Goodwill 92.png\nGoodbye and Goodwill 94.png\nGoodbye and Goodwill 113.png\nGoodbye and Goodwill 2.png\nGoodbye and Goodwill 3.png\nGoodbye and Goodwill 21.jpg\nGoodbye and Goodwill 4.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Tangled}}\n[[Category:Tangled characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
