In \"[[Ghoul Guides Save the Day!]]\", he becomes the third human to learn about Vee's true nature and the existence of monsters after [[Bridget (Vampirina)|Bridget]].\n\nHe is interested in all things supernatural, and uses his smartphone to film anything potentially interesting onto his web show \"Weekly Weirdness\". As a result, Vampirina and her parents try their best to keep their true identity as a vampire a secret so they can continue to live a normal life.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nEdgar is a friendly boy who is in love with anything weird such as monsters like Bigfoot.
