After the original, miniature model was destroyed by [[Megabot]], Yama creates a modified version as a superweapon known as '''Mega Yama'''.\n\n== Appearances ==\n===''[[Big Hero 6]]''===\nDuring Yama's bot-fighting, he fought a robot made by a girl with pink hair, and easily defeats her and destroy her own bot with Little Yama. After that, Hiro Hamada comes over and asks if he can fight Little Yama. Hiro purposely allows his robot, Megabot, to be defeated on his first attempt. This amuses Yama and he tells Hiro to go home, but Hiro bets more money. In this second fight, Megabot wins with sudden movements and manages to decapitate Little Yama. After the fight, Hiro says, \"no more Little Yama\", implying that Little Yama is beyond the point of repair and is permanently destroyed.\n\n===''[[Big Hero 6: The Series]]''===\nIn the follow-up series, Yama has since become a supervillain and recurring adversary of [[Big Hero 6 (team)|Big Hero 6]]. In \"[[Small Hiro One]]\", Yama creates a modified larger version of Little Yama under the new name, Mega Yama. Now giant and with the purpose to kill, Yama uses his new bot to fight against Big Hero 6 but is defeated. He later forces [[Trevor Trengrove]] to lure in students of the [[San Fransokyo Institute of Technology]], so that they would unknowingly lend their genius to modifying Mega Yama and make him impervious to Big Hero 6's attacks. The plan is a success, and Mega Yama greatly overpowers Big Hero 6. Unfortunately for Yama, Hiro uses the properties used for baking soda volcanos to override Mega Yama's system, causing it to erupt.\n\nIn \"[[The Bot Fighter]]\", Little Yama and Megabot have an official rematch that draws in a big crowd, but Yama once again meets his defeat at the hands of Hiro.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nBh6 0022.png\nSmall Hiro One 10.png\nSmall Hiro One 13.png\nSmall Hiro One 14.png\nSmall Hiro One 32.png\nSmall Hiro One 19.png\nTumblr nfoyd6qjin1sxz68do7 500.jpg\nTumblr nfoyd6qjin1sxz68do8 500.jpg\nBig-Hero-6-Bot-Fight-game.png\n</gallery>\n\n== Trivia ==\n\n*Little Yama is one of the first robot opponent in the app game ''[[Big Hero 6: Bot Fight]]'', as it start it off and helps players know how to attack with the robots in their team.\n**Little Yama is also given an second form to upgrade into and players can even try to win and place Little Yama in their own team.\n\n{{Big Hero 6}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n\n[[Category:Those destroyed]]\n[[Category:Weapons]]\n[[Category:Big Hero 6 objects]]"
