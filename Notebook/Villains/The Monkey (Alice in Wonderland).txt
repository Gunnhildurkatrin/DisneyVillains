Presently, the [[White Rabbit]] came riding up on a high-wheeled bicycle and crashed into the monkey, sending him flying into a vegetable frame. Upon hearing his [[White Rabbit|master]] fret over his glasses, which broke when the bicycle hit the ground, the monkey would have stood up, helped the [[White Rabbit]] into a wheelbarrow and proceeded to wheel it toward the [[White Rabbit's House|house]].\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nAliceMonkey (2).jpg|[[Alice]] meeting the Monkey\nAliceMonkey (3).jpg\nAliceMonkey (4).jpg\nAliceMonkey (5).jpg\nAliceMonkey (6).jpg\nAliceMonkey (7).jpg\nAliceMonkey (8).jpg\nAliceMonkey (9).jpg\nAliceMonkey (10).jpg\nAliceMonkey (11).jpg\nAliceMonkey (12).jpg\nAliceMonkey (13).jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Alice in Wonderland}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Monkey, The}}\n[[Category:Alice in Wonderland characters]]\n[[Category:Deleted characters]]\n[[Category:Monkeys]]\n[[Category:Servants]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
