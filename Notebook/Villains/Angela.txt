Appearing in the second season's Avalon arc, she was one of the surviving eggs of the [[Wyvern Castle]] massacre before being taken by [[Princess Katharine]] and the [[Magus]] to the magical kingdom of [[Avalon]] for safekeeping. She is later revealed to be [[Goliath]] and [[Demona]]'s biological daughter.\n\n==Background==\n===Physical appearance===\nAngela is a tall, slender [[Gargoyle (creature)|gargoyle]] with long dark brown hair worn in a ponytail and golden earrings. She has inherited her father's lavender skin complexion and hair color, although her features are closer to Demona's (even Elisa has expressed that she looks similar to Demona). When Angela left Avalon, she wore a one-piece conservative outfit but had later changed her outfit to a much more provocative two-piece white loincloth, reminiscent of Demona's typical style. This change on her part was made to express her growing up and pursuing her adult relationship with [[Broadway]].\n\n===Personality===\nAngela is the gentlest and most innocent member of the [[Manhattan Clan]], although she remains somewhat na\u00efve long after coming to [[New York City]]. She views harmony between humans and gargoyles as natural (thanks to her upbringing on the peaceful Isle of Avalon), and thus cannot understand why the humans of New York fear and hate her clan so much; it bewilders and grieves her. She is very trusting and kind and has a good judge of character.\n\nFrom [[Anton Sevarius]], Angela learned that Goliath is her biological father, and the relationship between them changed to uneasy; Angela wanted Goliath to accept her as his daughter, but Goliath stuck to the Gargoyle Way of raising their young and because being a parent was foreign to him until [[Diane Maza]] helped him better understand parenthood and the bond with one's children, and he accepted Angela as his daughter, to her happiness.\n\nShe eventually learned that her mother is [[Demona]], and expressed several times to Goliath she wanted to try and change her. Goliath had tried to keep them apart because he didn't want Angela to be hurt by Demona.\n\nTo Angela's joy, she found her mother did love her, but to her heartbreak, Demona manipulated her in the hopes of eliminating Goliath and swaying Angela to her side. Angela was driven to tears and rejected Demona's apologies.\n\n==History==\nAngela was one of the surviving eggs of the [[Wyvern Castle]] massacre before being taken by [[Princess Katharine]] and the [[Magus]] to the magical kingdom of [[Avalon]] for safekeeping. After some time, the eggs hatched, and Angela was born. Katharine and [[Tom]] raised the newly-born Gargoyles with love and care, but around when Angela reached adulthood, Avalon was attacked by the Archmage, supported by Demona, Macbeth, and the Weird Sisters who had guarded Avalon, but were defeated and chased off by the Magus when he and the others first came to Avalon for sanctuary after Scotland was no longer safe after Katharine's uncle, King Kenneth II, was murdered by Lord Constantine and he took over the kingdom, threatening to destroy Angela and the other eggs if Katharine did not swear fealty to him.\n\nWhen [[Goliath]], [[Elisa Maza]] and [[Bronx]] came to the island of Avalon after Tom came to Manhattan to see if Goliath has awoken from his stone hibernation the Magus placed him under before they fled Castle Wyvern, she helped them battle the [[Archmage]] and when the three left, she left with them, wishing to see the world. It was during the Avalon World Tour that Angela learned of her bloodline with being Goliath and Demona's birth-daughter, and during the journey, Goliath was forced to surrender the Eye of Odin back to its original owner, and cast the Phoenix Gate into the time stream to be lost forever after witnessing a dark future thanks to Puck.\n\nWhen the four finally are released from Avalon's magic to return to Manhattan, they reunite with Hudson and the Trio, and the Trio are formally introduced to Angela. However, they soon learn that Oberon is after David and Fox Xanatos' newborn son [[Alexander Fox Xanatos]], and reluctantly ally with Xanatos to stop Oberon. However, it was all part of an elaborate plan by Titania to get Fox to awaken her dormant Fae magic, thus allowing Alex to stay with his parents with Puck serving as his tutor.\n\nFollowing that, Angela begins to settle into living in Manhattan with the rest of the clan in the clock tower above Elisa's precinct, though she does contend with the Trio trying to quarrel over her affection before she puts them in their place. Later, thanks to Puck and Alexander when dealing with [[Coldstone]] and the three souls within him, Angela finally settles on choosing [[Broadway]] for her mate.\n\nUnfortunately, the return of the Canmore descendants and the Hunter with pursing Demona results in Angela being critically injured when the Hunters attack the clock tower and destroy it, injuring Captain Chavez in the process as well. Now blinded by the same all-consuming rage Demona has towards humanity, Goliath goes after the Hunters in revenge, but when one of them and Elisa apparently drown as a result, Goliath is devastated by it and comes to his senses. Taking the clan to stop Demona as she prepared her endgame to wipe out humanity from the very face of the Earth with a deadly virus she had created, Goliath forces her into a difficult position when he destroys the artifact that would protect Gargoyle kind from the virus' effects, meaning every Gargoyle on Earth would perish as well, including Goliath, Demona, and Angela, and Demona chooses to throw the canister towards them while she escapes. Confronted by the NYPD Anti-Gargoyle Task Force led by Matt Bluestone, Angela and the rest of the clan escape thanks to the surprise arrival of Xanatos with his personal helicopter, and he takes them back to Castle Wyvern and the Eyrie Building, offering their ancestral home back to them as thanks for their help regarding Alexander and to mend any remaining hostility from his previous actions against them. Thanking Xanatos, Goliath, his daughter, and the rest of the Manhattan Clan return to Castle Wyvern to continue protecting Manhattan from any future threats that might endanger it, including the likes of Demona or anyone else that are enemies to the Manhattan Clan.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nAngela 3.jpg\nAngelia Crouching.jpg\nAngela in the Rain.jpg\nAngela 2.jpg\nAngela2.JPG\nShadows of the Past.jpg\nFile:Shadows of the Past (2).jpg\nAngela .png\nAngela Gargoyles.png\nAngela Gargoyles 5.png\nFile:IshimuraClan.jpg\nCoyote 4.0.png\nAngela Gargoyles 2.png\nAngela Gargoyles 3.png\nFile:300px-Labyrinth Cells.jpg\nGoliath and Angela - Hunter's Moon Pt 2 (2).png\nGargoyle Kiss.jpg|Angela and Broadway kiss\nAngela Gargoyles 4.png\nFile:Broadway & Angela - Angels in the Night.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Printed Media==\n<gallery>\nDcm2nue-08e70ee4-b8f7-4828-af46-cfe5881d8237.png\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.gargwiki.net/Angela Angela] at GargWiki\n\n{{Gargoyles}}\n[[Category:Gargoyles characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Mystical animals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]\n[[Category:Scottish characters]]\n[[Category:Gargoyles]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]"
