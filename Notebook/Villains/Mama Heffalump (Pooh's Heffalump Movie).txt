She was introduced in the film ''[[Pooh's Heffalump Movie]]''. She worried over her son and warned him never to leave Heffalump Hollow, as there were scary creatures living outside it, but learned that the other residents of the [[Hundred Acre Wood]] are a lot like her. She and [[Roo]]'s mother, [[Kanga]], have since formed a friendship. Although she appeared in the first heffalump movie, she did not appear in ''[[Pooh's Heffalump Halloween Movie]]'', nor is mentioned although Lumpy does mention some holidays that his mother and he celebrate.\n\nMama Heffalump has been seen on occasion in ''[[My Friends Tigger & Pooh]]'', most notably in the film ''[[Tigger & Pooh and a Musical Too]]''. In all appearances to date, she has been voiced by Brenda Blethyn.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\">\nWinnie_the_Pooh_-_Lumpy_and_Mama_Heffalump.jpg|Lumpy with his Mother\nWinnie-the-Pooh-Wallpaper-winnie-the-pooh-6616070-1024-768.jpg\nlump3.jpg\nDarby Gives Mama Heffalump a Hug.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Winnie the Pooh}}\n[[Category:Winnie the Pooh characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Playhouse Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Toys]]\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Elephants]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:My Friends Tigger and Pooh characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]"
