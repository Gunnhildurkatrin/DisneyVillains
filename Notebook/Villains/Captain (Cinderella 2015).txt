After Kit promises [[Cinderella (character)|Ella]], Kit tries to hide his true identity as the prince from her when the captain is about to call him \"your highness\".\n\nLater, at the palace, the captain supports Kit's idea about inviting maidens besides princesses for the good of the people to the upcoming ball; much to [[The King (Cinderella)|the king]]'s joy and [[the Grand Duke]]'s chagrin. Next, the captain is seen training Kit in a sword fight but Kit has been recently distracted by the thought of Ella.\n\nOn the night of the ball, the captain appears to be happy to see Kit happily dancing with a beautiful, mysterious girl (Ella in disguise) but the Grand Duke is displeased since he had already promised the prince to the Princess Chelina of Zaragoza, a conversation that Lady Termaine overhears. At midnight, when Ella runs away, the captain, his men, and the Duke try to catch and retrieve Ella.\n\nAfter the unfortunate death of the King, Kit is proclaimed the new king of the kingdom and demands to search for Ella, or at the very least, the girl who fits the shoe she left behind; oblivious to the fact that the Grand Duke and Ella's wicked stepmother, [[Lady Tremaine]] know about Ella and have made a deal to make sure they get what they want: the Princess Chelina married to Kit for the Duke, a Countess position for Lady Tremaine, and wealthy lord suitors for her daughters: [[Drizella Tremaine|Drisella]] and [[Anastasia Tremaine|Anastasia]] even if it means manipulating the prince and getting rid of Ella. The Captain, his men, and the Duke search throughout the entire kingdom for the girl who fits the shoe but to no avail.\n\nFinally, they arrive at Lady Tremaine's home and try it on each of her daughters but still no luck. Just as the captain, his men, and the Grand Duke are about to leave, they hear Ella singing [[Cinderella's Mother|her mom]]'s lullaby \"[[Lavender Blue (Dilly, Dilly)|Lavender's Blue]]\", thanks to the [[mice]] who opened the door for the captain to hear her sing. When one of the guards turns out to be Kit in disguise and demands to see the girl, the captain finds Ella in the attic to get her and when her stepmother tries to forbid her from trying on the shoe, the captain defends her by overruling Lady Tremaine and he tells Ella to come with him; leaving the stepmother in the attic.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nCinderell-2015-disneyscreencaps.com-3849.jpg\nCinderell-2015-disneyscreencaps.com-8414.jpg\nCinderell-2015-disneyscreencaps.com-10202.jpg\nCinderell-2015-disneyscreencaps.com-10225.jpg\nCinderell-2015-disneyscreencaps.com-10336.jpg\nCinderell-2015-disneyscreencaps.com-10348.jpg\nCinderell-2015-disneyscreencaps.com-10573.jpg\nCinderell-2015-disneyscreencaps.com-10698.jpg\nCinderell-2015-disneyscreencaps.com-10700.jpg\nCinderell-2015-disneyscreencaps.com-10902.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Cinderella}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Captain}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Captains]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Cinderella characters]]\n[[Category:European characters]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in remakes]]\n[[Category:Horsemen]]\n[[Category:African characters]]"
