A running gag in the series is that he is often mistaken for an alien whenever he gets big or switches bodies with a human.\n\nZipper is introduced together with [[Monterey Jack]] in the five-part origin story \"[[To the Rescue]]\".\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nZipper is a brave, friendly, tough, spunky, and loyal fly. He is shown to be very close best friends with [[Monterey Jack]] most of the time.\n\n==Role in the series==\nZipper spent much of his life traveling the world with Monterey Jack. They are best friends. He joins the [[Rescue Rangers]] after Monterey's home is destroyed by [[Fat Cat]], in an event that gives Monterey a grudge against him that is strangely not brought up again anytime later in the series.\n\nZipper is the only member of the Rangers that doesn't speak, other than to making squeaky bird-like chirps. He is the smallest of the Rangers and laughs similar to the non-Disney character Woody Woodpecker.\n\nDespite the smallest of the group, Zipper serves as a big help to them. He can be quick to anger, often forcing others to keep him out of trouble. He hates seeing his friends in trouble. He is often seen traveling with Monterey Jack and sharing his opinions, facts, ideas, and inexplicably, his pain. Whenever Monterey suffers cheese attacks, Zipper proves to be tougher on him while talking him down. His special talent is mostly flight and lock-picking.\n\n===Other appearances===\n*[[Genie]] from ''[[Aladdin (1992 film)|Aladdin]]'' impersonated Zipper several times in the [[Aladdin (TV series)|TV series spin-off of the same name]].\n*Zipper also had a cameo in ''[[Mighty Ducks (TV series)|Mighty Ducks]]''.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n{{Rescue Rangers}}\n{{DuckTales}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Flies]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:DuckTales characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Mighty Ducks (TV show) characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Sorcerer's Arena Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Bugs]]"
