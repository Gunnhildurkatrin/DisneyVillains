She is Ron's adorable adopted baby sister.\n\n==Role in the [[Kim Possible|series]]==\nHana made her first appearance in the Season 4 episode \"[[Big Bother]]\". When the Stoppables adopted Hana, they had moved [[Ron Stoppable|Ron]] up into the attic and Hana into Ron's old bedroom\u2013after they turned it into a nursery\u2013without Ron's prior consent, input or even awareness, all in one day while Ron was still at school, leading Ron to view her as \"the intruder\" at first. By the episode's end, Ron came to fully accept Hana as his sister. He connects with her better than he does with his own parents and thus Ron became a very devoted big brother to Hana. Later, in \"[[Oh No! Yono!]]\", Ron was able to turn the tables on his parents by informing them\u2013very belatedly\u2013that Hana is a ninja child.\n\nLittle was known about Hana's heritage at first\u2013except that she is linked to the mythology of the [[Yamanouchi Ninja School]] and that she has a great destiny ahead which is tied to both the school and to Ron. She appears to be ethnically Japanese like [[Yori (Kim Possible)|Yori]] and [[Master Sensei]]. Her name is Korean for \"one\" and Japanese for \"flower.\" It was shown that she has incredible power, as she was able to pick up and throw [[Monkey Fist]] with only one hand, and later shows incredible agility and is able to run up walls and ceilings. Perhaps, like her new brother, Hana has mystical monkey powers. It was implied in the episode \"Oh No Yono\" that Yori may be Hana's biological sister and/or was the one who looked after her before Hana's adoption by the Stoppables. Ron's family was given her as Sensei decided that Ron should be the one to train and guard her. During \"Oh, No Yono!\", Hana defeats Monkey Fist by dancing to a song she loved because of Ron which caused her to bounce all over the place and eventually knock him out, defeating Yono as Monkey Fist summoned him, effectively saving the world.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Her name means \"one\" in Korean and \"Flower\" in Japanese.\n*Like Ron, who has at least one prophecy written about him, probably more than one, Hana also has a prophecy written about her.\n*One of Ron's prophecies, refer to him by the complete name of \"Ron Stoppable,\" and her prophecy refers to her as a \"Mystic Secret Weapon\".\n*What became of her biological parents is unknown.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\">\nhana_stoppable.jpg\nBig Bother 1.jpg\nBig Bother (6).png\nBig Bother (8).png\nBig Bother (11).png\nBig Bother (15).png\nBig Bother (16).png\nBig Bother (17).png\nhana-and-ron.jpg\nOh No!
