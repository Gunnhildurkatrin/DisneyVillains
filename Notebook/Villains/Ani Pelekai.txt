It is unknown who her father is.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the anime, when Ani and Stitch are spending time together while enjoying themselves, an instrumental of \"[[He Mele No Lilo]]\" can be heard playing as the background music.\n*Ani's surname is \"Pelekai,\" which is also her mother and aunt's surname. Since her father is not seen, it is unknown what happened to Lilo and her possible husband.  It's possible that Lilo was never married and gave her surname to her daughter Ani.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nKidda0.jpg|Ani meeting [[Stitch]]\nKidda1.png|Ani with Stitch and [[Yuna Kamihara|Yuna]]\nKidda2.png|Ani with an adult [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]]\nKidda4.png|Ani, alongside an adult Lilo and Stitch\nAni.jpg|Ani holding onto Lilo\nED00127846.jpg|Ani hugging Stitch\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pelekai, Ani}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Nieces]]\n[[Category:Polynesian characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
