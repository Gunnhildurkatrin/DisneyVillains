He is voiced by [[Frank Welker]]. \n\n==Background==\n===Physical Description===\nThe panther cub is short and small with black fur on his body, and gray fur in his ears and on his muzzle and underbelly. He has green eyes. He also has a red nose.\n\n===Personality===\nThe panther cub is frisky. He is also inquisitive. This can be seen when the panther cub plays with [[Pumbaa|Pumbaa's]] tail. Additionally, the panther cub is brave, blocking [[Ned the Elephant|Ned's]] way and making him fall into the river to prevent him from embarrassing [[Timon]]. He also has a liking for milk.\n\n==Appearances==\n===\"[[Unlucky in Lesotho]]\"===\nThe panther cub was found by [[Pumbaa]], who was looking for bugs. Pumbaa then took the cub home with him, wanting to surprise [[Timon]]. However, after arriving there, Pumbaa found out that Timon was reading a book that made Timon think black cats are bad luck. \n\nPumbaa then changed his mind about the panther cub and tried to hide him. Although Timon found the cub and made Pumbaa take him back, he appeared just before [[Ned the Elephant|Ned]] was about to humiliate Timon and caused him to fall into the river, thus saving Timon's reputation and becoming his friend.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The panther cub's voice actor Frank Welker voiced various other Timon & Pumbaa characters, including [[Bartholomew (Timon & Pumbaa)|Bartholomew]], [[Claudius]], and [[Uncle Ernie]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nPanther Cub 1.png\nPanther Cub 2.png|Pumbaa hiding the panther cub from Timon\nPanther Cub 3.png|The panther cub scaring Ned\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Lion King}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Timon & Pumbaa characters]]\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]"
