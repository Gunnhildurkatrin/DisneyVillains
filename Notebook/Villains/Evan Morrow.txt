A gifted but struggling hockey player, Evan struggles when he finds himself axed from his local hockey team, The Mighty Ducks, but finds new purpose when his mother, [[Alex Morrow|Alex]], convinces him to form his own hockey team to rival The Mighty Ducks.\n\n==History==\n===Forming the Don't Bothers===\nAfter Evan is dropped from [[the Mighty Ducks]] prior to them entering a new age division, he is saddened at the prospect of never playing hockey again. His mom, [[Alex Morrow|Alex]] suggests that they form their own team, however, but Evan is sceptical at first. After Alex gets things rolling, Evan is eventually able to see the positives in forming their own team, and agrees to lead the team as their captain. \n\nEvan tries to recruit fellow students to join their team, but finds this difficult. Nobody wants to join their team when the Ducks reign supreme. Nonetheless, with help of [[Nick Ganz|Nick]], Evan is able to form a team they begin practicing at the Ice Palace. \n\n===Troubles with Alex===\nThings become difficult for the team, and specifically Evan, when it appears that his mom isn't taking the team seriously. Evan is furious when Alex gives out trophies despite them not having played a single game. Alex tells Evan that the team is having fun, and this should be what hockey is really about, but Evan isn't convinced. Evan wonders if he has lost his chance at playing for a team professionally in the future given Alex's relaxed attitude. \n\nThings become increasingly complex for Evan when his efforts to convince his mom to take the Don't Bothers seriously go too far. Evan finds that Alex becomes driven on winning in an attempt to get to the state championships and beat [[the Mighty Ducks]]. Evan is reluctant to go along with Alex's strict training regime and diet, and tells her that she needs to relax. When she is reluctant, Evan fires her from the team, and [[Gordon Bombay|Coach Bombay]] takes her place instead. \n\n===State Championships===\n[[File:State_of_Play_Promotional_Photos_3.jpeg|250px|thumb|Evan with his mother, [[Alex Morrow|Alex]] at the championships.]]\nEvan is ecstatic when the Don't Bothers make it to the state championships. He is conflicted, however, when [[Sofi Hanson-Bhatt|Sofi]] hurts her knee, but refuses to sit on the sidelines, remarking that if she did so, the Don't Bothers would be disqualified from the championships. Evan is reluctant to allow her to play, however, and tells his mom and [[Gordon Bombay|Bombay]] about Sofi and her knee. She is seen by a medic but is told she can still play.\n\nEvan refuses to allow her to seriously injure herself to play in the championships, and sits out of the game, remarking that he will take responsibility for the team being disqualified instead. The Don't Bothers are therefore disqualified from the game and the championship win goes to Coach T and the Ducks. The Don't Bothers are able to win the following day against the Mighty Ducks, however, and take back the name.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Whilst initially sceptical about forming his own ice hockey team, Evan finds himself more at home as the captain of the team than he did whilst a member of the Mighty Ducks.\n*He and [[Sofi Hanson-Bhatt]] begin a romantic relationship.\n*Evan is responsible for firing, and rehiring, his mom as the coach of the Don't Bothers.\n*He is similar to Charlie Conway.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nThe Mighty Ducks Game Changers - Poster.jpeg\nThe Mighty Ducks Game Changers - Evan the Captain.jpeg\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Mighty Ducks}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:The Mighty Ducks characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Students]]"
