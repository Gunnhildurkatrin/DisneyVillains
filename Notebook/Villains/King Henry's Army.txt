The army was forced to retreat after King Henry was mortally wounded by Maleficent.\n\nAfter King Henry's death, Stefan became the new king of the kingdom and the army is under his control. Over the past 16 years, the army under King Stefan have spent all their efforts and resources in bringing down Maleficent, even tried to burn down the thorn walls over Moors and resorted to use of iron-based weapons and armor as fairies are weak to iron element, only to fail.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nB2A562C7-C506-46C1-A809-B59CCD6EFBB6.jpeg\nMaleficent-disneyscreencaps.com-1118.jpg\nMV5BNWExY2RiN2YtMGNmYy00MDc2LTk2ZjctYTQwZDc3NzQ3YTM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTc5MDI5NjE@.
