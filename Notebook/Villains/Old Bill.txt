Bill partook in the pirate's raiding of Puerto Dorado on the island of [[Isla Tesoro]]. During the raid, Bill was amongst the pirates who got extremely drunk with Bill drinking alone and trying to get alley cats drunk with him for company.\n\n===Development History===\nOld Bill was created for the [[Walt Disney World]] version of Pirates of the Caribbean in the [[Magic Kingdom]]. Following the ride's opening in [[1973]], Old Bill's scene would be integrated into the original [[Disneyland]] version of the ride.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===[[Pirates of the Caribbean (attraction)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]===\nOld Bill appears right before the flaming town scene in this ride, being seen near a bride drinking rum. As he drinks he attempts to give rum to several scared stray-cats while mockingly encouraging them to partake in the drink and laughing to himself.\n\n==Other Appearances==\n\n===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides]]''===\nOld Bill appeared in a deleted scene in this film. He appeared in a pub called the ''Captain's Daughter'', drinking rum while trying to give the drink to a stray cat. His dialogue was very reminiscent of that from the attraction in this unused scene.\n\n==Trivia==\n*A [[vinylmation]] figure would identify him as, \"'''Patches'''\". This figure also put a scar under his eyepatch, implying an ocular wound. While he often is shown with an eyepatch over his right-eye in the ride it is unclear if he wears it to hide a wound or to adjust his eyes for darkness as sailors historically did.\n*A [[2006]] action-figure identified him as being, \"'''The first-mate'''\".\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nPOTCRideOldBill.jpg\nOSTOldBill.jpg|Bill in a deleted scene from ''Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides''\nPatches.jpg|The \"Patches\" vinylmation of Old Bill.\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*[http://pirates.fandom.com/wiki/Old_Bill Old Bill] on [http://pirates.fandom.com/wiki/ Pirates of the Caribbean Wiki].\n\n{{Pirates of the Caribbean}}\n[[Category:Pirates of the Caribbean characters]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
