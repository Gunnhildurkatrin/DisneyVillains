A member of the Don't Bothers, but has trouble skating. He recently moved to [[Minnesota]] from Toronto, [[Canada]] with his dad to live with his aunt.\n\nLogan is the third member to join the Don't Bothers. When [[Evan Morrow|Evan]] and [[Nick Gaines|Nick]] first meet him, they expected that he was a great hockey player because of his expensive skates and equipment. However, when he comes to the first practice, they find out that he is actually terrible at hockey, and can't even skate.\n\nLogan was able to distract the receptionist at the Ducks arena by smooth talking and showing off his hair. This allowed the Don't Bothers to sneak into the lost and found to find proper hockey equipment.\n\nLogan is revealed to be a talented cook, as he made candy pancakes for the Don't Bothers while they watched their first win.\n\nLate in the season, despite receiving attention for his looks, he became frustrated feeling that he was the weak link on the team. This prompted [[Gordon Bombay]] to take him under his wing and teach him how to skate. Logan revealed that his parents are divorced and they bought him the equipment but didn't teach him how to use it. \n\nLater, Bombay noticed Logan making pancakes and decided to teach him how to flip the puck much like a pancake. \n\nNick began feuding with Logan before the Don't Bothers played the Huskies. Logan eventually revealed that he was jealous of the relationship Nick had with his mothers. He said he learned how to cook because his home life was a mess. The two then reconciled.\n\nDespite Bombay's pleading, [[Alex Morrow|Alex]] refused to put Logan in the game. Late in the game, Nick distracted Alex during a timeout so that Logan could take his place. Logan then received a pass from Evan, picked the puck up with his stick, skated behind the net, yelled \"Order up!\" and flipped it in the top corner of the net to win the game and send the Don't Bothers to the state championships.\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"185\">\nThe Mighty Ducks Game Changers - Poster.jpeg\nThe Mighty Ducks Game Changers - Logan the Hair.jpeg\n</gallery>\n{{The Mighty Ducks}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:The Mighty Ducks characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Canadian characters]]"
