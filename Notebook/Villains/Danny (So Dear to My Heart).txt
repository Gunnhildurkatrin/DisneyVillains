He appears in two forms as a live-action black lamb and an animated character in the Kincaid family scrapbooks that comprise the film's animated segments.\n==Appearances==\n===''So Dear to My Heart''===\nDanny is a black lamb born on the Kincaid family farm that was primarily raised by Jeremiah Kincaid when his mother abandoned him. He was named after the famous racehorse, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Patch Dan Patch], who Jeremiah saw when Dan's railway tour stopped in his small town. Wanting everyone to appreciate Danny as much as he did, he sought to enter him in a contest at the Pike County Fair, though his grandmother becomes critical of this ambition, seeing that he might care more about winning then Danny's wellbeing.\n\nJeremiah's hopes for Danny to find success are illustrated in the film's animated sequences, which take the form of scrapbooks and postcards where a wise owl advises the animated Danny in lessons of courage and determination.\n===Disney Park===\n[[File:Danny TDL.jpg|thumb|220x220px]]\nIn [[2015]], for the Chinese Zodiac \"Year of the Lamb\", Danny became the central focus of a plush merchandising line at [[Tokyo Disneyland]]\u00a0similar to [[Duffy the Disney Bear]], with collectible ribbons serving as a means of customizing Danny plush toys. A statue of him in his animated form was installed in [[Westernland]] wearing a prize ribbon as part of that.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"185\">\nSo-Dear-to-My-Heart-1948-Jeremiah-Kincaid-and-Danny-classic-disney-38462272-866-649.jpg|Danny (in live-action form) with Jeremiah Kincaid\nRogerrabbit-disneyscreencaps.com-8024.jpg|Danny's cameo in ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''\n</gallery>\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{So Dear to My Heart}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Who Framed Roger Rabbit cameos]]\n[[Category:Sheep]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:So Dear to My Heart characters]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters in live-action films]]"
