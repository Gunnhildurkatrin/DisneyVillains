I Feel Like a Woman\", which results in most of the restaurant guests staring at her, Scott tells her that it kind of scared him a bit, and he wasn't expecting a performance. She gives him an angry look and gets up to leave after telling him that it was not an easy thing to do and doesn't want to continue the date if he is the kind of man who can't support a woman's ambition.\n\n{{The Santa Clause}}\n[[Category:The Santa Clause characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
