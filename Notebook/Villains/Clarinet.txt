Worried, it then hurries to find the instruments in panic. It then appears again in psychedelic colors as it frantically tries to find the missing instruments part of the orchestra across the sequence. After finding the instruments, it and the rest of the instruments are reunited together, but as the ground morphs into a whirlpool, the Clarinet dives into the closing whirlpool to get reunited back to the instruments again.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The Clarinet has been sporadically featured in the front cover of many VHS and DVD releases of ''Make Mine Music'', despite the limited availability of the film and many merchandise inspired by it.
