They are two of the mice that help [[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]] get ready to go to the ball and are the common Cinderella mice in the [[Disney Parks]].\n\n==Background==\n<tabber>Perla=\n'''Perla''' is a slender brown female mouse that wears purple hat and pink dress with an apron sometimes wearing all pink or purple clothing. She sometimes acts as the leader of Cinderella's [[Mice|mouse]] and [[Birds (Cinderella)|bird]] friends when Cinderella can't finish her ball gown and sends off [[Jaq and Gus]] to get the trimming, since she has sewing experience. Like the other mice, Perla cares for [[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]] and thinks of her as a mother or big sister. She holds a best friend bond with Suzy, whom she is seen with on a regular basis sometimes along side [[Mary (Cinderella)|Mary]]. Perla is very smart and thinks quickly in terrible situations.\n\n|-|Suzy=\n'''Suzy''' is a slender brown female mouse that wears blue hat and blue dress with an apron sometimes wearing all green clothing. She is a friendly mouse that helps the other mice finish [[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella's]] ball gown. Like the other mice, Suzy cares for Cinderella and thinks of her as a mother or big sister. She holds a best friend bond with Perla, whom she is seen with on a regular basis sometimes along side [[Mary (Cinderella)|Mary]]. Suzy is very smart and moves quickly in terrible situations.\n</tabber>\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''===\nPerla and Suzy wake up in the morning listening to Cinderella sing \"[[A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes|A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes]]\" as well as helping her dress up for the day.\n\nLater, Cinderella shows them [[Cinderella's Dress|her mother's old dress]], which she plans to redesign as her dress for the ball. When she is called away by her stepfamily for more work that keeps her occupied for the rest of the day, Perla, Suzy and the others take over the duty of redesigning the dress (\"[[Work Song (Cinderelly, Cinderelly)|Cinderelly, Cinderelly]]\"), which they show to Cinderella at the end of the day.\n\n===''[[Cinderella II: Dreams Come True]]''===\nPerla and Suzy are two of the mice that help with the [[Fairy Godmother]]'s stories that set the plot in motion. Jaq, Gus, and Mary had the most prominent role in this film, while the Perla and Suzy along with the other mice were mainly seen in between each segment, with the exception of them appearing alongside them in the three shorts.\n\n===''[[Cinderella III: A Twist in Time]]''===\n[[Jaq and Gus]] only appear, but the rest of the mice including Perla and Suzy are mentioned by Cinderella, when Cinderella pretends to plan to get rid of them, as part of her strategy to reclaim the [[Magic Wand|Fairy Godmother's wand]].\n\n===Other appearances===\nA female mouse wearing a pink dress possibly Perla or Suzy made a cameo appearances in the ''[[House of Mouse]]'' series and movies. In [[Ralph Breaks the Internet]] one of them possibly Suzy made a cameo with [[Jaq and Gus|Jaq]], [[Jaq and Gus|Gus]], and the [[Birds (Cinderella)|Birds]] when [[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]] said to [[Vanellope von Schweetz|Vanellope]], if animals can talk to her and holds them up. A few moments later, Cinderella asked them and the others seam up comfy clothing for each of the princess (which they do offscreen). In the series finale of ''[[At Home With Olaf]],'' a short clip of ''Cinderella'' featuring Perla and Suzy appears during a montage of heartwarming moments from Disney films playing in [[Olaf]]'s song \"[[I Am with You]]\".\n\n==[[Disney Parks]]==\nPerla and Suzy appear in the parks usually seen with [[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]] or [[Fairy Godmother]] being the common mice of the Cinderella franchise in the parks, appearing in Cinderella parades and shows.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Perla and Suzy do not appear in the third movie, ''[[Cinderella III: A Twist in Time]]'', as the only mice who appear in the film are [[Jaq and Gus]]. They were nevertheless alluded to in the opening when Cinderella asked the Prince what the mice were doing with her shoes.\n*Out of all the mice in ''Cinderella'' Jaq, Gus, Perla and Suzy are the only ones to have made appearances at the [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney theme parks]], due to the success of the original ''Cinderella'' film over the decades.\n\n\n{{Cinderella}}\n{{House of Mouse}}\n{{Wreck-It Ralph}}\n{{DisneyTsumTsum}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Mice]]\n[[Category:Cinderella characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Wreck-It Ralph cameos]]\n[[Category:Raw Toonage Characters]]\n[[Category:Tsum Tsum characters]]\n[[Category:Disney on Ice characters]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]"
