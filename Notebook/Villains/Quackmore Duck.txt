My father, my uncle, my cousin...\"). Donald's father was created by\u00a0[[Carl Barks]], who first mentioned him in the Donald Duck family tree he sketched out for personal use in the 1950s. On this tree, he appeared as [[Grandma Duck]]'s son and [[Scrooge McDuck]]'s brother-in-law. Barks named Donald's father Quackmore Duck, and also mentioned his wife, Donald's mother, and Scrooge's sister, whom he named\u00a0[[Hortense McDuck]].\n\nDonald's parents first appeared in ''[https://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=S+75182 Donald Duck Writes a Book]''. During Donald's flashback, they could be seen dancing to the music of a gramophone in one panel. Donald tells that his parents were not rich, but nonetheless fun-loving people.\n\n[[File:Treeworden735678657.jpg|thumb|left|Donald Duck's parents on Mark Worden's Duck family tree.]]In Mark Worden's illustrated version of Barks' 1950s Duck family tree, Quackmore and Hortense were also given a portrait. On this tree, Quackmore appeared with black hair and a large, curly mustache.\n\nIn the comic book series\u00a0''[[The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck]]'', Quackmore had a supporting role. In the series' 10th chapter\u00a0''[[The Invader of Fort Duckburg]]'', he meets Hortense, who has a temper very similar to his own. At the beginning\u00a0of the following chapter, ''[[The Empire-Builder from Calisota]]'', Hortense and Quackmore are engaged, and Quackmore is said to be Scrooge's bookkeeper. Near the end of the story, he and his family leave [[Duckburg]].\n\n==Television==\n===[[DuckTales (2017 series)|''DuckTales'' (2017)]]===\nPictures of Quackmore appear in [[Woo-oo!]], the premiere of the ''[[DuckTales (2017 series)|Ducktales]]'' reboot, and he is mentioned by name by [[Webby Vanderquack]].  In \"[[The First Adventure!]]\", he is mentioned to be in the hospital as he was in a fire cracker accident started by Donald and Della.\n\n===''[[Legend of the Three Caballeros]]''===\nA picture of Quackmore and Hortense is seen in the episode \"[[Dope-a Cabana]]\".\n\n==Trivia==\n*Quackmore's surname is subject to inconsistency. By [[Walt Disney]] himself, Donald's father is [[Ludwig Von Drake]]'s brother, citing that Donald doesn't share his father's surname because he took his mother's maiden name (\"Duck\") instead.<ref name=\"fact\" /> However, in the Duck family tree notes that Carl Barks made during the 1950s (from which Quackmore's name originates), long before Ludwig was introduced, the \"Ducks\" are the paternal side of Donald's family, and the \"McDucks\" are the maternal side.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nQuackmore and Hortense meet.jpg|Quackmore and Hortense first met each other when Scrooge crashed in the farm.
