He is not to be confused with [[Mayor Turkey Lurkey]] from the [[2005]] movie of the [[Chicken Little (film)|same name]].\n\n==Role in the short==\nHe first appears when [[Foxy Loxy (1943)|Foxy Loxy]] tells a group of turkeys, including Turkey Lurkey, that [[Cocky Locky]] may be dictating situations (as they often discuss the things wrong with the world), as an effort to influence Chicken Little's role as the leader.\n\nHe is later seen being lead by Chicken Little, along with the other farm birds. The birds follow the signs to Foxy's cave, where he now has them trapped.\n\nAfter the narrator reassures the audience that it was a typical \"Happy Ending\" for the turkey and the other birds. However, it is later contracted, as it's revealed that Foxy Loxy had eaten him and the other birds, warning the Narrator that he shouldn't believe everything he reads, all while smoking a cigar and playing with Chicken Little's yo-yo.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nTurkey Lurkey from Chicken Little.jpg|Turkey Lurkey with the other Turkeys\nTumblr nk3a441Knz1r3jmn6o2 1280.png\n124-006smartset.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Turkeys]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:English characters]]\n[[Category:Silly Symphonies characters]]"
