He was a previous love interest of [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim]]'s earlier on in the series.\n==Role in the series==\nJosh is [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim Possible]]'s former love interest. Being an artist, musician, and overall popular student, Kim had a huge crush on him in her early career in [[Middleton High School|Middleton High]].\n\nAccording to [[Ron Stoppable|Ron]], his middle name \"could be\" \"Wendel\", as depicted in Ron's briefing of his moves over the spirit week dance to Kim. Much like Ron, he is an easy-going and kind-hearted person. Unlike Ron, however, he is not a goofball, and is implied to be a well-graded student. He is also incredibly mellow, and has only very mild reactions to the assorted weirdness he witnesses when Kim's missions cut into her civilian life.\n\nJosh is also part of a local band of some sort, as he and his friends were setting up musical equipment during the Centurion Project incident,<ref>[[October 31st]]</ref> and commented on the project being under Kim's costume when she arrived.\n\nKim would typically to turn into a nervous wreck when she was around him, but eventually built up the courage to go on a date with him in one episode.<ref>[[Blush]]</ref> Although the date was regularly interrupted by [[Dr. Drakken|Doctor Drakken]] and his scheme to kill Kim off, it eventually smoothed out into an enjoyable affair, and it seemed like the two would be together afterwards. However, they grew apart later in the series and separated amicably. He briefly dated [[Tara]], one of Kim's fellow cheerleaders, afterwards.<ref>[[Emotion Sickness]]</ref> However, they apparently broke up at some point before ''[[Kim Possible Movie: So the Drama|So the Drama]]'', as [[Bonnie Rockwaller|Bonnie]] comments Tara going out with Jason Morgan.<ref>[[Kim Possible Movie: So the Drama]]</ref>\n\nJosh Mankey has not appeared since the events of \"[[Emotion Sickness]]\", and did not appear in Season 4, meaning he either graduated or transferred or had phased from Kim's life, and little else is known of his home life.\n\n==Relationships==\n===[[Kim Possible (character)|Kim]]===\nDuring Kim's early sophomore year, she would typically turn into a nervous wreck when she was around Josh, but with Ron's help eventually built up the courage to ask Josh to the Spirit Dance.\n\nLater, during Kim's early junior year, Josh called Kim and asked her to go on a date with him in, which Kim did despite the fact that Drakken had sprayed her with a formula that made her vanish when she became embarrassed. Thanks to Ron retrieving the Aurora Orchid, Kim was cured and Kim gave Josh a kiss at the end of the date.\n\nDespite Kim and Josh going on a date during the Aurora Orchid incident Ron's actions when Monkey Fist turned Kim into a monkey point towards Kim and Josh not being a couple immediately following their date.\n\nBy the Middleton Days of their junior year Kim stated that she and Josh had grown apart, moved on, and split up, which implies that they likely became a couple at some point following the full monkey incident.\n\n===[[Tara]]===\nJosh was seen with Tara during the Middleton Days parade preparations of her junior year, and after Tara dated an unnamed boy at some point before Kim had to deal with the team-up of Drakken and Motor Ed.<ref>[[Steal Wheels]]</ref> However, they apparently broke up, as Tara later went to the prom with Jason Morgan, the basketball team star.<ref>[[Kim Possible Movie: So the Drama]]</ref>\n\n==Trivia==\n*His last name is a pun on monkey, an animal that Ron fears. This is commented on in \"Blush\" when Ron says that Mankey is only one vowel away from monkey.\n*Mankey is also the name of a Fighting-type Pok\u00e9mon that first appeared in ''Pok\u00e9mon: Red and Green'' (''Blue'' in the US) ''Versions'' and resembled a fuzzy white monkey with a pig nose. It evolves into Primeape.\n*\"Manky/Mankey\", especially in the UK, is a derogatory term, meaning: \"inferior; worthless; dirty and unpleasant; dirty, unclean\",<ref>http://oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/english/manky</ref> and may be partially why he was removed from the series.\n*Kim mentions him in the [[Rufus (episode)|crossover episode]] of ''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]'', thereby placing the crossover during the second season of ''Kim Possible''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" position=\"center\">\nOctober 31st (4).jpg\nBlush.jpg\nBlush (4).jpg\nOctober 31st (14).jpg\npsstmankey.jpg\nCrush.jpg\nBlush (6).jpg\nBlush (5).jpg\nBlush (7).jpg\nBlush (8).jpg\nBlush (9).jpg\nBlush (10).jpg\nBlush (11).jpg\nBlush (12).jpg\nBlush (13).jpg\nBlush (15).jpg\nFull Monkey (21).jpg\nFull Monkey (22).jpg\nOctober 31st (15).jpg\nOctober 31st (16).jpg\nOctober 31st (17).jpg\nOctober 31st (18).jpg\nOctober 31st (19).jpg\nOctober 31st (20).jpg\nOctober 31st (21).jpg\nOctober 31st (22).jpg\nBlush - Kim and Josh.jpg\nTara and Josh Mankey.png\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Kim Possible}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mankey, Josh}}\n[[Category:Kim Possible characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Artists]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
