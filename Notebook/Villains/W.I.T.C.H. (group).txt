The group's members were chosen to protect [[Kandrakar]] from people and creatures who wish to cause harm to it. Each member controls one of the five elements (fire, water, earth, air and energy) and consists of [[Will Vandom|Will]], [[Irma Lair|Irma]], [[Taranee Cook|Taranee]], [[Cornelia Hale|Cornelia]] and [[Hay Lin]], whose initials form the title acronym '''W.I.T.C.H.'''\n\nIn the comics, Taranee was briefly replaced by [[Orube|Rebecca Ruldoph]] as the guardian of Fire.\n\n==Members==\n*[[Will Vandom]] \u2013 Will is the leader of W.I.T.C.H. and the keeper of the Heart. She has the ability to teleport people wherever she wants and can sense strange phenomena. She can shoot and manipulate large forms of energy (Quintessence) and change her appearance at will. She can also create Astral Drops as well.\n*[[Irma Lair]] \u2013 Irma is the guardian of Water. Her powers include intuition and manipulating water to do her bidding. She has also been known to exhibit light mind control. Her latest power allows her to see visions in the water.\n*[[Taranee Cook]] \u2013 Taranee is the guardian of Fire. Her powers include controlling fire at her will, producing heat waves, reading minds and being able to communicate with people telepathically.\n*[[Cornelia Hale]] \u2013 Cornelia is the guardian of Earth. She can manipulate earth, rocks, metal, and wood and speak with the Earth, make plants and flowers grow big and tall. She can move objects with her mind, and can sometimes experience prophetic visions from the earth.\n*[[Hay Lin]] \u2013 Hay Lin is the guardian of Air. Her powers include the control over air, the ability to fly and being able to recall the past by the use of sound. She can also touch an object and get a complete history of where it's been, and the atmosphere it came from. Hay Lin also has the powers of empathic premonition, and in the show she can become invisible.\n\n==Former Members==\n*[[Orube|Rebecca Rudolph]] \u2013 Orube briefly served as Taranee's replacement, although she was given no elemental powers. She left after the 3rd saga was ended, but continued living in Heatherfield.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Some instances suggested that, even if the guardians have a natural affinity with one element, they can swap them if needed or wanted to do so: this is a central theme in the special issue ''Core of Kandrakar'', which shows them testing other elements, except for Will; Will herself will swap her Quintessence power for the Earth one in the ''Cornelia/Caleb'' special.\n\n{{W.I.T.C.H}}\n[[de:W.I.T.C.H.
