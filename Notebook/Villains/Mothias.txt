[[Nefir Hasenuf|Nefir]] says that Mothias is an imp-eating moth that spreads plague and destruction wherever it goes and tries to run away from him. Once, there were many moths like Mothias according to Nefir, but the imps wiped out all but one; that one being a larval Matthias, whose silk could cure any illness. During the fray Iago is eaten, only for Mothias to spit him out when it realizes the parrot was not an imp. While the moth is after Nefir, [[Iago]] makes the imp free [[Genie]] from a bottle so the djinn can rescue him. Genie builds a web to trap Mothias, but ends up getting himself caught by it. So he makes Nefir build the web. He then ties Nefir up in the center of the web as bait to make Mothias approach the imp. When Mothias dives after Nefir, Genie then completely covers Mothias with his own silk, sealing him in a cocoon once again. \n\n== Trivia ==\n* Mothias vaguely resembles Mothra from the Godzilla film franchise, though more malevolent and nowhere near as large.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n{{Aladdin}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Aladdin characters]]\n\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Butterflies]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]"
