She makes her debut in ''[[The Lion King: Six New Adventures]]''.\n\n==Appearance==\nZuzu is never described in the text, but in the only given picture of her, her appearance is similar to that of Zazu, except her feathers appear more purple.\n\n==Information==\n===''A Tale of Two Brothers''===\nZuzu was just another bird in the [[Pride Lands]] and then [[Ahadi]]\u2019s majordomo. She was a very maternal, pleasant bird, and never passed the chance for some juicy gossip, much like her son, [[Zazu]]. [[Ahadi]] appoints her and her family to be stewards to all the future Lion Kings.\n\n===''How True, Zazu?''===\nIt is revealed she retired and gave the place as majordomo to her son, [[Zazu]].\n\n{{TheLionKingWiki}}\n{{The Lion King}}\n{{stub}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:The Lion King characters]]\n[[Category:Hornbills]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Servants]]\n[[Category:African characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
