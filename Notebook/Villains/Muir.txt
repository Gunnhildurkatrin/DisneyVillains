It is known that he feels sensitive whenever a wildfire occurs, especially when burning trees fall and block his path. Fortunately, thanks to Dusty, he manages to break through the trees blocking his path.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Planes: Fire & Rescue]]''===\nIn ''Planes: Fire & Rescue'', Muir is seen puffing along a train track as [[Dusty Crophopper]] flies past him. He later stops at the Grand Fusel Lodge area, delivering passengers for them to enter, alongside Secretary of the Interior. Later as the fire emerges at [[Piston Peak National Park|Piston Peak]], [[Andr\u00e9 (Planes)|Andr\u00e9]] tells the evacuating guests that Muir's coaches are full, telling the remaining guests to find a staff member who would lead them to safety. As Muir continues leading the lodge guests to safety, he notices a flaming tree blocking his path during a massive wildfire. Later, during a plan to extinguish the fire, Dusty extinguishes the flaming tree going past him while the Smokejumpers work together as Muir clears the extinguished debris blocking his path as the train continues moving safely across it. The wildfire, however, stops.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Unlike the steam locomotive seen in ''[[Planes]]'', Muir's mouth is on the front of his smokebox door instead of his cowcatcher.\n*These types of engines were used most common on American railroads during the 1800s and 1830s until 1928.\n*Muir is likely based on a locomotive that worked on the Virginia & Truckee Railroad which was the [https://locomotive.fandom.com/wiki/Virginia_%26_Truckee_No._13_Empire Virginia and Truckee No. 13 Empire].\n*There are a few shots in the movie where the animation on Muir's running gear is messed up, and his rods move incorrectly. Also, in one of these shots, his front set of drive wheels isn't turning while the other two are.\n*His tender is lettered \"Piston Peak Railway\".\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\n6172036511393.jpg|Disney Store\nPlanes-fire-rescue-disneyscreencaps.com-7717.jpg\nPlanes-fire-rescue-disneyscreencaps.com-7325.jpg\nPlanes-fire-rescue-disneyscreencaps.com-7319.jpg\nPlanes-fire-rescue-disneyscreencaps.com-7310.jpg\nPlanes-fire-rescue-disneyscreencaps.com-6781.jpg\nPlanes-fire-rescue-disneyscreencaps.com-2179.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*[[w:c:worldofcarsdrivein:Muir|World of Cars Wiki: Muir]]\n*[[w:c:disneyplanes:Muir|Planes Wiki: Muir]]\n\n\n{{Planes}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Planes characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Vehicles]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Trains]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Transportation]]"
