Hostile and ravenous, they try to eat [[Tiana]] and [[Prince Naveen|Naveen]] when they arrive in the bayou after being transformed into frogs by a curse of the evil [[Dr. Facilier]]. Only two of their names are revealed which are Ian and Marlon.\n\n==Personalities==\nIan, Marlon, and the rest of the alligators have wild, vicious, hot-tempered, impatient, and temperamental personalities. They are shown to be hungry whenever prey arrives in their territory and they are impatient to get angry easily, when their prey escapes from them.\n\n==Role in the film==\nIan and Marlon and the other three alligators appeared in the swamp and try to eat [[Tiana]] and [[Naveen]] after they were ambushed by a hostile heron. Thinking the hard ground Tiana and Naveen land is a log, a float of alligators approaches the two. Naveen believes them to be moving logs at first, but as they come closer, Tiana claims that they aren\u2019t logs and they soon find out that what they are on isn\u2019t a log either as Ian raises his head out of the water revealing that they are actually on his back. The alligators then attempt to devour Tiana and Naveen. However, Tiana manages to swim into an old hallow tree trunk in order to hide from the alligators and watches them wildly leaping in and out of the water in horror, thinking they might have eaten Naveen. Fortunately, Naveen then reveals himself to be right below Tiana leaning against the trunk as he asks her to lower a vine to help him into the trunk. Tiana refuses at first, but when the vicious alligators spot Naveen and approach him ready to eat him, he hastily promises to grant her [[Tiana's Palace|her dream restaurant]] if she helps him escape the gators so she frantically agrees and helps Naveen into the trunk with her. The alligators then laugh wickedly as they decide to wait all night for Tiana and Naveen to come out. They eventually give up on waiting for Tiana and Naveen to come out and they leave as they were gone the next morning. No alligators besides [[Louis (The Princess and the Frog)|Louis]] (who shows a friendly personality rather than a hostile personality to the frogs) appear for the remainder of the film.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nIan.png|Ian the Gator appears \nMarlon.jpg|Marlon the Gator tries to eat Naveen\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Marlon's voice actor, Emeril Lagasse, also starred in the long-running Food Network show, ''Emeril''.\n\n{{The Princess and the Frog}}\n[[Category:The Princess and the Frog characters]]\n[[Category:Alligators]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]"
