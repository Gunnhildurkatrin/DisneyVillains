She is the Jefferson County Middle School's science teacher.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality and Traits===\nShe seems to be very fond of her desk that she claims to have built herself, in which she talks very fondly of it and starts caressing it in front of the class. Aside for being fond of her desk, she's very responsible and competent when it comes to science assignments and projects, but clearly worries that things could go wrong with or without Milo's EHML around, although she cares for her students sake, even Milo.\n\n===Physical Appearance===\nMrs. Murawski is a slender and a little bit attractive woman in her late thirties or early forties with fair skin, black eyes, brown hair held on a bun, wears earrings and crimson red lipstick. As for her outfit, she is usually seen with a beige blouse and her belt surrounding it from the waist height, a red and brown scarf, light brown skirt and dark brown over-the-knee boots with light brown high heels.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\">\nSunny Side Up 6.jpg\nSunny_Side_Up_2.jpg\nBackward to School Night 1.png|Mrs. Murawski is a toddler\n</gallery>\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Milo Murphy's Law}}\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Schoolteachers]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Milo Murphy's Law characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Teachers]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
