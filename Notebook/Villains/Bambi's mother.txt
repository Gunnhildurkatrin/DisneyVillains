Don't look back! Keep running! Keep running!|Her last words to [[Bambi (character)|Bambi]]|Bambi (film)}} \n\n'''Bambi's mother''' is a major character in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[1942]] animated feature film, ''[[Bambi (film)|Bambi]]''. She was a doe who lived in the forest as the mate of [[the Great Prince of the Forest]], and mother to their son, [[Bambi (character)|Bambi]]. She dedicates the latter half of her life to raising Bambi in preparation for life in the forest. Shortly into her son's childhood, however, she is killed by an unseen hunter known as [[Man]].\n\nThe death of Bambi's mother is widely regarded as one of the most shocking, yet significant moments in cinematic history, as it introduced children to the concept of parental death in a way that had never been seen prior.\n\n==Background==\nLittle is known about the early life of Bambi's mother except that she and her future husband, the Great Prince, met in childhood and that she grew up with another doe named [[Mena]]. It is also known that she was a relative to Ena, who is probably either her cousin or sister (as mentioned in the original novel)\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Bambi (film)|Bambi]]''===\nBambi's mother is introduced after having just given birth to her only son. She is often teaching Bambi about the forest and warning him of the dangers of Man. She and her son endure a harsh winter in which there is little food in the forest.\nWhile out in the meadow, she and Bambi find a small patch of grass to graze, but as they eat, she senses danger and tells Bambi to run back to the den as fast as he can. She sprints after him, continuing to urge him onward. Gunshots are heard in the background, but she tells him to keep running, and not to look back. After another gunshot rings throughout the forest, Bambi makes it safely back to the den, but finding his mother isn't with him, leaves and begins calling for her in vain. The Great Prince finds Bambi, and tells him that she could no longer be with him, and to come with him. This reveals the death of Bambi's mother, and that the Great Prince was his father.\n\n===''[[Bambi II]]''===\nBambi's mother makes a short appearance to Bambi in his dream, telling him that everything would be alright and that she would always be with him in his heart. After waking up, Bambi still hears her voice. He goes to the meadow and discovers she is not there. Her voice still trails out on the meadow, sending Bambi to find her and into what becomes a life and death situation. After being saved from Man's dogs by his father, Bambi learns that it wasn't his mother that he heard, but a tool used by Man to make a deer noise.\n\nOn their way home, Bambi asks his father if his mother is ever coming back, and the Great Prince sadly answers no, meaning that Bambi's mother is dead.\n\nLater in the film, when [[Mena]] was trapped by one of Man\u2019s snares and tells Bambi to run, she inadvertently repeats the last words that Bambi\u2019s mother shouted before she died, which prompts Bambi to lure the dogs away from Mena, so she wouldn\u2019t suffer the same fate that his late mother did.\n\n===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===\nIn the episode \"[[Devil's Due]]\", [[Cruella De Vil]] mentioned one of her furs and says \"I'm not saying it's [[Bambi (character)|Bambi]]'s iconic dead mother, and I'm not saying it's not.\"\n\n===Other appearances===\nIn ''[[The Sword in the Stone]]'', [[Kay]] is hunting a deer who looks very much like her.\n\nIn ''[[The Jungle Book]]'', a deer that strongly resembles her is grazing in a meadow, and being unknowingly stalked by [[Shere Khan]].\n\nShe and Bambi make a cameo in the [[Donald Duck]] cartoon, ''[[No Hunting]]''. When she notices litter going down the stream, she tells Bambi, \"Man is in the forest. Let's dig out.\"\n\nIn ''[[The Rescuers]]'', during the song \"[[Someone's Waiting For You]]\", she and Bambi are seen grazing in [[Devil's Bayou]].\n\nShe, along with many other Disney Characters, made cameo appearances in the film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''.\n\nIn ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', there is a deer grazing in the opening scene that greatly resembles her.\n\n==Trivia==\n*At one point, the film was meant to show her body after she was shot but was later removed as it would be too dark. Despite this, it is considered to be one of the most horrific and graphic deaths in all of Disney history.\n*[[w:c:flintstones:Jean Vander Pyl|Jean Vander Pyl]], who was the original voice of [[w:c:flintstones:Wilma Flintstone|Wilma Flintstone]] in the series, ''[[w:c:flintstones:The Flintstones (TV series)|The Flintstones]]'' and its spin-offs, originally auditioned for the role of Bambi's mother, but the production team later turned her down and stated that her voice sounded \"too young\" for the character.<ref>https://www.upi.com/Archives/1993/12/22/It-makes-74-year-old-show-business-veteran-Jean-VanderPyl-happy/1395756536400/</ref>\n*[[Discarded Fun Meal Toys|Tae-Kwon Doe]]'s head in the ''[[Toy Story Toons]]'' short, ''[[Small Fry]]'' also resembles her.\n*A deer resembling her appears in the ''[[Sofia the First]]'' episode \"[[Holiday in Enchancia]]\" as one of the forest animals who helps [[Sofia the First (character)|Sofia]] track down her father.\n*In ''[[The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse]]'' episode \"[[House of Tomorrow]]\", Mickey attempts to read the ''Bambi'' story. But, the AI controlling the house spoils the death of Bambi\u2019s mother, ruining the story.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Concept Art===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nBambi deadmotherdeleted.jpg|Bambi's mother's dead body in an image for a deleted scene\nBambiModels 4.jpg|Bambi and his mother in a concept sketch/design\nBambiModels 3.jpg|Old Stag, Ronno, Bambi, Bambi's mother, and Faline in a size comparison sheet\n</gallery>\n\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nBambiMother.jpg|Bambi's mother senses Man coming\nBambiandhismother.jpg|Bambi's mother and Bambi in the meadow\nEscaping from Man.jpg|Bambi's mother escaping from Man\nEveryone respects him.jpg|Bambi's mother looking at her mate\nMan is coming.jpg|There is something wrong: Man is coming...\nBambi's-mother.jpg|Bambi's mother running\nBambi's Mother.jpg\nTumblr mwutt0Sux01qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg|Bambi and his mother in a cameo in ''[[No Hunting]]''\nBambi and his mother in winter 2.png\nBambi and mother winter.jpg\nBambi 8.jpg\nBambi 4.jpg\nGreat Prince 7.png\nThumper 2.png\nTumblr n56v0jsUI71r3jmn6o1 1280.png\nTumblr nn9vudigK51r3jmn6o1 1280.png\nBambi's Mother appearing in The Sword in the Stone..jpg|Bambi's mother in ''[[The Sword in the Stone]]'', about to get shot by Kay\nBambi's Mother in her cameo apearance.png|Bambi's mother in ''[[The Jungle Book]]''\nBeauty and the Beast Bambi's mom Cameo.jpg|Bambi's mother in ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]''.\nBambiandhismother.2.png|Bambi's mother appearing to him in his dream in ''Bambi II''\n</gallery>\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nBambi's mother.gif\nBambi-mother-embrace.png\nBambi-Mother-bambi-8246938-904-625.jpg\nBam5.jpg\nAnimaatjes-bambi-04570.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Bambi}}\n[[de:Bambis Mutter]]\n[[es:La Madre de Bambi]]\n[[fr:M\u00e8re de Bambi]]\n[[it:Madre di Bambi]]\n[[nl:Bambi's moeder]]\n[[pl:Matka Bambiego]]\n[[pt:M\u00e3e de Bambi]]\n[[pt-br:M\u00e3e do Bambi]]\n[[ru:\u041c\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0411\u044d\u043c\u0431\u0438]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Bambi characters]]\n[[Category:Deer]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Grandparents]]\n[[Category:Mentors]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Who Framed Roger Rabbit cameos]]\n[[Category:Wonderful World of Color]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Princesses]]"
