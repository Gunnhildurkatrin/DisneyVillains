He has also some graphical similarities to Jolly Jumper, Lucky Luke's talking horse in the eponymous french comic serie, but this is probably fortuitous.\u00a0\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\n1951-dude-1.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Horses]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]"
