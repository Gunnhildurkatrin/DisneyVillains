These seagulls are said to fly around the ''[[Silent Mary]]'' under Salazar's command as the undead crew continued their mission to hunt down Captain Jack Sparrow as they continued to squawk very loudly showing support to Salazar. After the Trident was broken, it is likely that the seagulls have reverted back to their normal forms afterwards.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales|Dead Men Tell No Tales]]''===\nAfter [[Jack Sparrow]] gives his [[Jack Sparrow's compass|compass]] to the innkeeper, a flock of ghost seagulls flies across the Silent Mary sailing past the Devil's Triangle just as [[Captain Salazar]] and his [[Crew of the Silent Mary|undead crew]] celebrate in escaping the Triangle in a plan to hunt down Jack Sparrow who betrayed his compass.\n\nOne seagull lands on the ''Red Dragon'' as one of the ship's crewmen notices it only to find out the bird disappeared. The same bird reappears again and frightens the pirate onboard as it is shown that the seagulls are linked to the ''[[Silent Mary]]'' just as the undead seagulls fly around the ''Mary'' sailing past the ''Dragon'' which was ultimately rammed and destroyed by Salazar's ship.\n\nArriving near Hangman's Bay, [[Lesaro]] told his captain to send in undead sharks to go after Jack Sparrow as a flock of undead seagulls continued flying around the ''Silent Mary'' squawking loudly. During the search for the Trident of Poseidon, a flock of ghost seagulls surrounded both the Black Pearl and the Silent Mary just as Salazar tells [[Henry Turner]] to go after Jack Sparrow who is after the [[Trident (Hercules)|Trident]] just as Salazar and his undead crew travelled to Poseidon's Tomb to go after the pirate.\n\nAs the Trident of Poseidon has been destroyed, all curses are broken, so it is likely that the seagulls have been reverted back to their normal forms as it is shown that the crew of the ''Silent Mary'' returned from their undead forms to their mortal forms.\n\n==Video game appearances==\n===''[[Disney Crossy Road]]''===\nIn the discontinued video game, ''[[Disney Crossy Road]]'' as part of the ''Dead Men Tell No Tales'' add-on update to the ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' world, a singular undead seagull can be found perching on one of the barrel obstacles when playing as one of the characters who originated in ''Dead Men Tell No Tales''. When approached on random occasions, the seagull makes an ominous squawking noise, indicating that the player found the seagull, which unlocks the Ghost Seagull character after finding it.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nDead Men Tell No Tales 01.jpg|A ghost seagull next to a pirate onboard the ''Red Dragon''\nDead Men Tell No Tales 02.jpg|The seagull staring at the pirate\nDead Men Tell No Tales 04.jpg|The seagull frightening the pirate\n</gallery>\n\n{{Pirates of the Caribbean}}\n{{Disney Crossy Road}}\n[[Category:Pirates of the Caribbean characters]]\n[[Category:Seagulls]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
