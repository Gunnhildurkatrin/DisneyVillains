She is [[Milo Murphy|Milo's]] older sister who is very protective to her little brother. Even though she intends to worry that Milo's misfortunes could ruin her important moments, she still likes to spend time with him.\n== Personality ==\nSara Murphy is quite protective of her little brother, Milo. She is sometimes worried that Milo could ruin her important moments, but she still likes to spend time with him. Sometimes her concerns about Murphy's Law overwhelm her so that she makes errors, ruining the moment for herself. (\"[[The Doctor Zone Files]]\"). She uses her cellphone a lot. (\"[[The Wilder West]]\").\n\nShe is a huge ''[[Doctor Zone]]'' fan. Her shirt and pajama shirt both have a Time Ape image on them. (\"The Doctor Zone Files\") She once spent an entire day on the Nowhere Desert Dude Ranch taking pictures and collecting dirt samples because she believed it to be the filming location of an episode of ''Dr. Zone''. She also has an interest in comic books. (\"[[Love Toboggan]]\")\n\n== Physical Appearance ==\nSara is a fair-skinned, slender girl aged seventeen years. She has chin-length blonde hair and blue eyes.\n\nShe wears violet capris, a white T-shirt with light blue sleeves and a picture of Time Ape on the front, and red sneakers with white soles. She wears green four-leaf clover hair clips.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Like Milo, she carries a backpack loaded with stuff for any misfortune, even though it seems she is not jinxed by Murphy's Law like her brother.\n*According to tradition, Four-leaf clovers bring good luck. It is reasonable to believe that Sara wears clovers in her hair to counteract the bad luck that usually happens around her family.\n*Sara is one of the only seven characters whose eyes are shown with pupils.\n** The others are [[Martin and Brigette Murphy|Brigette Murphy]], [[Melissa Chase]], Jackie, Joni, Mr. Block, and Mr. Brulee.\n\n* She sometimes watches Orton Mahlson from behind a tree on his property.\n* Sara's dad introduced her to ''Doctor Zone'' when she was in fourth grade.\n* She once asked her mom if she could change her name to \"Time Ape\", but her mother refused (\"Love Toboggan\").\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\">\nThe Doctor Zone Files 1.png\nThe Doctor Zone Files 3.png\nThe Doctor Zone Files 4.png\nThe Doctor Zone Files 5.png|Sara wearing a radiation suit\nThe Doctor Zone Files 6.png\nThe Doctor Zone Files 7.png\nThe Doctor Zone Files 8.png\nThe Wilder West 5.jpg\nFamily Vacation 1.png\nFamily Vacation 5.png\nWe're Going to the Zoo 1.png\nMilo's Halloween Scream-A-Torium! 1.png|Sara dressed as Dr. Zone\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Milo Murphy's Law}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Murphy, Sara}}\n\n[[nl:Sara Murphy]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Milo Murphy's Law characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
