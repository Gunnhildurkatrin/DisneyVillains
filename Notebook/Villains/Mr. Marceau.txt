"[[File:MrMarceau.png|thumb|250px]]\n'''Mr. Marceau''' is a science teacher at [[Webster High School]]. He was seen in the ''[[ANT Farm]]''\u00a0episode\u00a0\"SciANTs Fair\". In \"SciANTs Fair,\" he was shown to be very annoying, talking with an unusually loud voice. He constantly yells for no reason due to his wife recently having a baby girl and his mother-in-law moving. Now he \"never gets any peace and quiet.\" Because of no peace and quiet, he gave everyone in his class A's because he was too stressed to grade them. His name was never mentioned in the show, it was only seen in the credits.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Marceau}}\n[[Category:A.N.T.
