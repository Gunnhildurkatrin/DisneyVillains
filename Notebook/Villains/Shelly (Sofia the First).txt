She first appears in the ''[[Sofia the First]]'' episode \"[[Cool Hand Fluke]]\".\n\n==Role in the Series==\nShelly first appears with Oona, [[Sven (Sofia the First)|Sven]], [[Slim (Sofia the First)|Slim]], [[Fluke]], and [[Flip (Sofia the First)|Flip]] while playing a game of Capture the Conch which Fluke wins. Suddenly, a ship that Oona identifies as the [[Floating Palace]] appears at the surface, to Oona's delight. Oona tells them the Floating Palace belongs to Princess Sofia, her human friend, and her family, the Royal Family of Enchancia, and goes off with Sven.\n\nOona and Sven come back with Sofia, who Shelly is delighted to finally meet because of her magical abilities and because of the rescue she made the last time she was in Merroway Cove. Her delight is intensified when Oona tells them about the party Sofia is throwing in the mercolony's honor at sunset. Shelly decides to make one of her band's songs a gift for Sofia's family.\n\nThey are in the middle of playing their song when Slim shows up and says Fluke's in trouble. Sure enough, Fluke had gotten stuck in a giant clam. They get him out but Flip's mantacorn horn gets broken in the process. Fluke goes off to get another horn from the [[Mantacorn]]'s cave. Sofia and Oona go after him to keep him safe. Shelly and Flip later arrive at the cave to help only to find her friends fine and learns the mantacorn is a music lover. They later play their song for Sofia's family.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Shelly's voice provider, [[Jenna Lea Rosen]], originally provided the singing voices for [[Princess Hildegard]] and [[Princess Clio]], so she is the first character that Rosen provides the speaking voice for.\n{{Sofia the First}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Shelly}}\n[[pt-br:Shelly (Princesinha Sofia)]]\n[[Category:Sofia the First characters]]\n[[Category:Mermaids]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]"
