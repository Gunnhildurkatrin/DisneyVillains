He was the only agent in the history of S.H.U.S.H. to capture the villainous [[Phineas Sharp]], and he prided himself on having done so without the use of any gadgets or gimmicks. When Sharp escaped from prison and stole the master list of S.H.U.S.H. agents, [[J. Gander Hooter]] called Blunt out of retirement and partnered him with [[Darkwing Duck (character)|Darkwing Duck]], much to the elder agent's disgust. Initially spiteful of one another (Blunt of Darkwing because of his overreliance on gadgets and Darkwing of Blunt because of his \"phobia of modern technology\"), the two eventually learned to get along after Darkwing saved them both from one of Sharp's deadly traps the Role of 007.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nvlcsnap-2011-09-26-21h38m33s154.png\nvlcsnap-2011-09-26-21h37m46s187.png|Derek Blunt with Darkwing Duck\nvlcsnap-2011-09-26-21h37m52s3.png|Blunt with J.
