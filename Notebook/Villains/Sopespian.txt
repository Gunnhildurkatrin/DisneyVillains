He is portrayed by Dami\u00e1n Alc\u00e1zar.\n\n==History==\n\nDuring the Narnian Revolution Sopespian had plotted with fellow lord Glozelle and [[Gergiore]] overthrow king Miraz and take over the kingdom themselves. Their plan worked as they talked Miraz into accepting the challenge to a duel with [[Peter Pevensie]]. He was a Marshal of the Lists for Miraz along with Glozelle, and during the duel, Sopespian subtly killed Miraz (in the book, Glozelle killed Miraz), blaming it on Peter and convincing the Telmarines to charge the Narnians. The Telmarine Army, led by Sopespian, seemed to have the upper hand on the Narnians, but then the tide of the battle began to change when the Trees were awoken by [[Aslan]] and began to attack the Telmarines. During the course of the battle that Sopespian instigated, Glozelle was knocked out after hesitating when he had the chance to kill [[Caspian X|Caspian]]. Sopespian decided to retreat to the river, where he figured the Telmarine Army would have a decisive advantage over the Narnians, but when they got there, they found [[Lucy Pevensie|Lucy]] and Aslan waiting for them. Aslan roared and awoke the spirit of the river, who destroyed the main bridge, slaying a good number of Telmarines, and then seemingly consumed Sopespian personally.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nNarnia_prince_caspian_6.jpg\nMiraz-ToCN.jpg\nMiraz-sopespian-TCoN.jpg\nGlozelle-sopespian.jpg\n</gallery>\n==Trivia==\n\n*In the book, it was Glozelle who killed Miraz instead of Sopespian.\n\n==External links==\n*{{Interwiki|https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/6/64/Favicon.ico|narnia|Sopespian|Narnia}}\n\n{{The Chronicles of Narnia}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Chronicles of Narnia characters]]\n[[Category:Knights]]"
