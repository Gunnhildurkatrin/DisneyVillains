However, the character was removed from the film (along with Owen) and the scene got scrapped because it didn't seem to be working. However, on ''The Emperor's New Groove'' DVD, the scene where he was having a family conversation and throwing a party for Kuzco as a llama is in the deleted scenes.\n\n\n\n{{The Emperor's New Groove}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:The Emperor's New Groove characters]]\n[[Category:Deleted characters]]\n[[Category:Peruvian characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
