He is the launderer of the orphanage who goes to bring clean bed sheets for [[The Orphans (Annie)|the orphans]]' beds and take away dirty ones every month. He has an unrequited love for [[Miss Hannigan]].\n\n== Role in the film ==\nMr. Bundles is only shown in one scene. After cleaning their entire room (\"[[It's the Hard Knock Life]]\"), Mr. Bundles joyfully greets the orphans with fresh sheets. Unlike Miss Hannigan, he seems happy to take care of them, taking away their dirty sheets and replacing them whether they need it or not.\n\nDuring his visit to the orphanage, Miss Hannigan impatiently guides Mr. Bundles through the orphans' sleeping quarters. She finds Molly buried underneath the sheets in a large hamper, and becomes annoyed.\n\nDespite Miss Hannigan's impatience, Mr. Bundles continues his job with a smile. While he replaces the sheets and puts the dirty ones in a large hamper, he asks her out on a date. She rebuffs his request, saying that she is waiting for [[Oliver Warbucks]]. He leaves with the hamper disappointed, unaware that [[Annie (character)|Annie]] is hiding underneath the sheets.\n\nThe orphans, unable to control their laughter, announce to Miss Hannigan that Annie escaped from the orphanage through the hamper. Miss Hannigan rushes out onto the streets to chase after Mr. Bundles, as the orphans watch from the window, laughing.\n\nLater on, Mr. Bundles is mentioned by Annie in Oliver Warbucks' office. She says that she hasn't really seen anyone work before, other than him, and decides that she would rather watch Oliver work than play elsewhere.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Mr. Bundles seems to be a very jovial and happy man, unlike Miss Hannigan. It is unknown why he is so fond of her.\n* Mr. Bundles asked Miss Hannigan out several times before the day Annie escaped. She replied no every single instance.\n* Mr. Bundles' first name is never mentioned.\n\n{{Annie}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bundles, Mr.}}\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Servants]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Annie characters]]"
