He was voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]].\n\n==Mighty Ducks==\n\nDuke is a former notorious jewel thief on Puckworld. He reformed after he saw how [[Lord Dragaunus|Dragaunus]] and his people were taking over Puckworld. Duke has used a Puck Blaster in some episodes, but he mainly uses a golden sword called a Ducksaber (or sometimes just a 'saber'). He also carries lock picks and a grappling hook attached to his wrist. Duke has a Brooklyn accent and is pretty level-headed, albeit egotistical at times. He also has an eyepatch. He was the leader of a gang called the Brotherhood of the Blade. He remains the most experienced of all the Ducks and possesses a good balance of skill with confidence. \n\nDuke wears an eye patch over his right eye due to a sword accident. He also has a chip in his beak, which is probably from a fight he got into. His jersey number is 13.\n\n==Gallery==\n\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==References==\n<references />\n{{DEFAULTSORT:L'Orange, Duke}}\n{{The Mighty Ducks}}\n[[Category:Mighty Ducks (TV show) characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Superheroes]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Characters with disabilities]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]"
