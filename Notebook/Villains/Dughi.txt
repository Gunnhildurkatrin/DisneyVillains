He is a red panda who is part of [[Domog]]'s pack.\n\n\n\n==Background==\nLike all the red pandas part of Domog's pack, Dughi is shown to be nervous whenever a ghost arrives in the bamboo forest to threaten the red pandas. He did work together with Bunga and the [[Lion Guard]] to help fight [[Chuluun]] with teamwork.\n\n==Role in the series==\n===\"[[Ghost of the Mountain]]\"===\nAfter [[Bunga]] grabs some Tuliza for [[Kion]], Dughi and the other red pandas gaze upon him as he and the other red pandas chant \"Sonessen Khun\" believing the honey badger is their protector. [[Anga]], Kion, and the rest of his team witness the red pandas chanting for Bunga. Looking at the red pandas cheering for him, the group arrives to the spot where the red pandas prepare a throne for him. When [[Beshte]] tries asking Dughi about Bunga, he explains that he and the other red pandas have been waiting for \"Sonnesen Khun\" (Bunga) to help save them from the ghost of the mountain pestering them. As Kion tells the red pandas about Bunga, he explains that the Chosen One cannot leave until he defeats the Ghost. Later, the leader of the red pandas, [[Domog]], arrives just as Dughi takes him to introduce himself to the Lion Guard to which Domog tells the [[Lion Guard]] to learn the legend of the ghost of the mountain as he explains that only \"Sonnesen Khun\" can save the red pandas from the ghost. Later when Domog allows Bunga to bring followers to help him fight the ghost of the mountain, Dughi and the other red pandas bid a farewell to find and defeat the ghost and save the red pandas to wish them good fortune.\n\nLater after the Guard discovers that the ghost of the mountain is actually a snow leopard named \"[[Chuluun]]\" and Chuluun starts chasing them in the bamboo forest, the Lion Guard decides to stop Chuluun before she attacks the red pandas. Just as Bunga and the Lion Guard confront Chuluun, she retreats back to the snowy mountain. Bunga then devises a plan to help find and defeat Chuluun in order to save the red pandas just as Dughi and the rest of the red pandas arrive and work together to defeat Chuluun.\n\nArriving at the snowy mountain, Dughi and the other red pandas surround Chuluun under Bunga's command, along with the Lion Guard and [[Makini]] just as Bunga uses his stench ability to defeat her and save the red pandas from Chuluun's devious plans with teamwork. Dughi and the other red pandas cheer for Bunga for completing his task of saving the red pandas. Later when the Lion Guard finds the [[Moja Kwa Moja Stone]] in the bamboo forest, the Lion Guard then follows the path to the next landmark marked on the stone; Dughi and the other red pandas bid a farewell to the Lion Guard for helping save them from Chuluun with teamwork. Dughi tells Domog about the legend of \"Sonnesen Khun\", to which Domog denies and tells him that he and the other red pandas should move on since Bunga helped defeat the ghost; however, Chuluun is shown to have survived her battle against Bunga.\n\n==Trivia==\n*\"Dughi\" means \"round\" in Mongolian language.\n\n==External links==\n*[https://lionking.fandom.com/wiki/Dughi Dughi] on [https://lionking.fandom.com/wiki Lion King Wiki].\n\n{{The Lion King}}\n[[Category:The Lion Guard characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Pandas]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]"
