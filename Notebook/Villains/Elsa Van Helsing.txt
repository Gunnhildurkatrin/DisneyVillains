She lives next door to him with her tyrant uncle, [[Mr. Burgermeister|Mayor Burgermeister]], who forces her to be this year's \"Little Dutch Girl\" at the town's Dutch Day celebration. Elsa also has a beloved pet, her poodle [[Persephone (Frankenweenie)|Persephone]], and truly empathizes with Victor when he loses Sparky. She is the object of Victor's affections. Her appearance looks like a female counterpart to Victor. Although she and Victor may not show it, but the two neighbors appear to harbour romantic affections towards each other.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Frankenweenie]]''===\nElsa is living with her uncle Mr. Burgermeister while her parents are away, and he is forcing her to be the Little Dutch Girl for the celebration, which she doesn't want to do.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Elsa Van Helsing bears a strong physical resemblance to Lydia Deetz, a character from [[Tim Burton]]'s [[1988]] film, ''{{WikipediaLink|Beetlejuice}}''. Winona Ryder, Elsa's voice actress, also played Lydia.\n*Elsa's surname is a reference to [[Wikipedia:Abraham Van Helsing|Professor Abraham Van Helsing]], a prominent character from {{WikipediaLink|Bram Stoker}}'s 1897 horror novel ''{{WikipediaLink|Dracula}}'', who is Dracula's nemesis.\n*Elsa being kidnapped and terrorized by the Vampire Cat may draw parallel to Winona Ryder's portrayal of Mina Harker in Bram Stoker's Dracula.\n*Elsa's first name was named after the actress {{WikipediaLink|Elsa Lanchester}}, the woman who starred opposite Boris Karloff in {{WikipediaLink|Bride Of Frankenstein}} as the titular character.\n*Elsa's parents are never revealed in the movie.\n*Victor Frankenstein is also older than her.\n*Elsa's hair is similar to Temari's hair from ''Naruto''.\n*This Elsa was introduced a year before the [[Elsa]] from ''[[Frozen]]'', although it is the ''other'' Elsa that more people are familiar with, largely due to the level of success of the film and the song \"[[Let It Go]]\".\n*Her last name is the same as Ericka Van Helsing from ''Hotel Transylvania 3'' released six years later.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\n040 mr 0286.jpg|Elsa and her classmates\nFrankenweenie-disneyscreencaps com-5444.jpg\nFrankenweenie-disneyscreencaps com-6692.jpg|Elsa as the Dutch Girl\nFrankenweenie-disneyscreencaps com-6694.jpg|Back view of her singing in front of the crowd\nFrankenweenie-disneyscreencaps com-9377.jpg|Elsa crying\nElsa Van Helsing and Persephone.png|Elsa showers Persephone with love\nElsa Van Helsing.png|Clipart of Elsa Van Helsing\nTumblr n4klewHaik1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*[[w:c:frankenweenie:Elsa Van Helsing|Elsa Van Helsing]] on the [[w:c:frankenweenie:Frankenweenie Wiki|Frankenweenie Wiki]]\n\n{{Frankenweenie}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Van Helsing, Elsa}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Frankenweenie characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Deuteragonists]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Nieces]]\n[[Category:Tritagonists]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:European characters]]"
