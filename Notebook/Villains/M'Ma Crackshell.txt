She usually sits around at home, watching soap operas on her TV. Her most recognizable active role was in \"[[My Mother the Psychic]]\", where she receives psychic powers after getting shocked while trying to fix her television and is kidnapped by [[Flintheart Glomgold]]. At the end, another accident removes her powers and she goes back to normal.\n\n===[[DuckTales (2017 series)|''DuckTales'' (2017)]]===\nMrs. Crackshell appears in the reboot in the episode \"[[Who is Gizmoduck?!]]\". This incarnation is a strong-willed police officer who, like her son Fenton, has Latin American roots. She shares her original counterpart's love of soap operas but does not live in a trailer park.\n\nIn \"[[The Dangerous Chemistry of Gandra Dee!]]\", she gives Fenton his father's suit that she's been saving for a special occasion so Fenton can go on a date with [[Gandra Dee]].\n\nIn \"[[Moonvasion!]]\", Mrs. Crackshell reveals she is aware Fenton is Gizmoduck, yet still feels the need to protect her son despite wearing the [[Gizmosuit]].\n\nIn \"[[Louie's Eleven!]]\", she's seen near the end of the episode arresting [[Falcon Graves]] for his crimes.\n\nIn \"[[Beaks in the Shell!]]\", Mrs. Crackshell questions Huey about Fenton's relationship with Gandra Dee, demanding him to ask her about it immediately. Fenton interrupts and his wife asks him about Huey telling her about her son's relationship with Gandra. Huey later explains to her that Fenton is Gizmoduck. Soon as Gyro Gearloose enters and becomes confused of Huey and Louie in the same room, Mrs. Crackshell notices this in shock. Furthermore, Mrs. Crackshell enters the virtual GizmoCloud world and encounters her son who started a relationship with Gandra in a plan to save Fenton from Mark Beaks. Mrs. Crackshell wears battle armor and engages in combat with him only for Mark to remove her armor. Looking at Mark being so powerful, Mrs. Crackshell, Gandra, Huey, Gizmoduck, and Gyro gain their battle armor to defeat Mark in teamwork. With Mark Beaks defeated, Gizmoduck explains to his mother about him not telling the truth about Gandra to which before leaving the GizmoCloud, Gandra explains that she must get the GizmoCloud off of F.O.W.L.'s servers and leave the company forever. Gizmoduck and his mother leave the virtual world of the GizmoCloud afterwards.\n\n==Printed material==\n===''[[Darkwing Duck (Boom!
