You were just denying your inner child.\"\n\nDuring the second film, Neil was surprised to hear that Scott has to get married in order to keep being Santa. Neil tells Scott that he can do it before he notices Scott slowly changing back to his old face.\n\nIn the third film, Neil and Laura guilt Scott into inviting Lucy to the North Pole because it did not seem fair that he brought his son and not her there. They also insist on going along to supervise. Once at the North Pole, Neil and Laura are greatly amazed at the sight of being at the actual workshop, and happily enjoy themselves.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nNeil Miller(1).png|Neil Miller in ''[[The Santa Clause]]''\nNeil Miller(2).png|Neil in ''[[The Santa Clause 2]]''\nNeil Miller(3).png|Neil in ''[[The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause]]''\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{The Santa Clause}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Miller, Neil}}\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]\n[[Category:The Santa Clause characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Stepparents]]"
