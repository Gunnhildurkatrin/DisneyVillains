'''Experiment 036''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp;&nbsp;Stitch'' franchise]]. He\u00a0is designed to poke holes in water containers.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment 036 was the 36th experiment created created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to use his spiky tail to poke holes in water containers. 036 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.\n\nAt an unknown point, 036 was presumably activated, captured by [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Stitch]], and named Poki.\n\nIn \"[[Shoe (episode)|Shoe]]\", Poki was one of the experiments that helped turn [[Jumba's Ship|Jumba's ship]] into a [[Jumba & Pleakley's Bed & Not Breakfast|hotel]].\n\nIn \"[[Remmy (episode)|Remmy]]\",\u00a0Poki was one of the experiments in Lilo's dream.\n\n===''[[The Origin of Stitch]]''===\nPoki was one of the experiments that was gliding on the screen, but he is 575 instead of 036.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nIn the film's opening, Poki can be seen with [[Slushy]] as the latter sells [[Shave Ice]].\n\nLater, the first 624 experiments, including Poki, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium\u00a0to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]] and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nPoki participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]].\n\nThe Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Poki is one of the few experiments to not appear in the group photo at the end of ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\n036_Poki-1-.jpg\nStitch experiments wallpaper.jpg\nscreenCapture 08.07.13 2-15-19.jpg\nscreenCapture 08.07.13 2-18-43.jpg\nscreenCapture 08.07.13 2-29-33.jpg\nscreenCapture 08.07.13 2-52-51.jpg\nscreenCapture 08.07.13 2-56-58.jpg\n33494404040.jpg\nVlcsnap-2012-07-02-19h42m39s46.png\nvlcsnap-2012-11-29-16h27m32s137.png|Poki with [[Slushy]]\nvlcsnap-2013-07-05-17h48m07s177.png\nVlcsnap-2012-07-03-21h27m08s117.png\nVlcsnap-2013-07-20-10h39m33s156.png\nVlcsnap-2013-03-30-19h52m03s194.png\nVlcsnap-2013-03-14-09h38m47s233.png\nThe Origin Of Stitch Poki.png|Misidentified as Experiment 575 (Magnarette)\npanes13.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
