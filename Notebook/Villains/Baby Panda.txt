However, every time Mickey tries to photograph the panda, he changes his looks (e.g. the panda puts a fake mustache on, etc.), much to his frustration.\n\nMickey ends up in a monkey exhibit and runs up a tree, where he tries to take the panda's picture from that tree, but the camera is knocked out of his hand by an elephant. Mickey then lands in the panda exhibit, where the Baby Panda takes the camera and runs with it. \n\nAs a result of hitting a pole twice while trying to get the camera back, Mickey ends up with two black eyes, making a mother panda think that Mickey is a panda (also mistaking him for her cub). The episode ends with the Baby Panda taking a picture of Mickey being cradled by the mother panda.\n\n{{Mickey Mouse (TV series)}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Bears]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Chinese characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Pandas]]\n[[Category:Zoo Animals]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse (TV series) characters]]"
