When [[Paul (Inner Workings)|Paul]] stops to eat breakfast at a caf\u00e9, his brain tells him that he might order a heavy breakfast which could be a bad idea albeit with his heart telling him to become more spontaneous. On his way to the office, Paul's brain and heart get into an argument, embarrassing three nearby seniors thinking that Paul is embarrassing them, albeit him having an argument with his brain. Later after Paul's brain feels miserable along with Paul himself and one of the nearby colleagues, Paul's brain and heart suddenly get along during lunchtime as he decides to become more spontaneous in the things he did not want to do at first such as eating caf\u00e9 breakfast, trying in a pair of sunglasses from the [[Kate (Inner Workings)|vendor]], and getting into the water, making him relieved.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nHeart smiling.jpg\nInner Workings 1.jpg\nInner Workings Heart plush.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Heart}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
