He quit the game when in the team photograph, he discovered he came up to the other players\u2019 knees. He then turned to baseball, but three people stepped on him (they thought he was second base). He went from baseball to football, until two quarterbacks threw him for touchdowns. It was after his gridiron career that he latched onto Henry. When Wendell and Henry get together\u2014well, nobody dares mistake Wendell for anything but what he is: a small, singing bear.''\n\n<gallery widths=\"208\">\nCountrybearsdisneylandfun.jpg|Wendell with [[Liver Lips]] and [[Shaker]] in ''[[Disneyland Fun]]''.\nVlcsnap-2014-06-28-22h18m22s194.png\n302739_449436995091521_1755234800_n.jpg\nMaxresdefault223.jpg|Wendell with [[Big Al]] and [[Shaker]] in ''[[Campout at Walt Disney World]]''.\nSas-campout-02.jpg\nScratchyourback.jpg\nWDW32502020Country20Bear20Band.jpg\nRoy clark 30th anniversary.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Bears]]\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Country Bear characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Hunters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
