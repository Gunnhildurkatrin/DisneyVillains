She is typically soft-spoken, but out going and friendly. She is not afraid to be honest about things to the point that she openly embarrasses her daughter, [[Felicia Sundew|Felicia]]. Sylvia claims to have a soft spot for the weird ones, like [[Hop Pop Plantar|Hop Pop]], and it shows in her own weird ways. She likes to act up, most likely as a way to show that their is still a lot of spark in her spirit. However, she does display a lot of insight and understanding as well, such as when she knew that [[Sprig Plantar|Sprig]] was feeling left out of their fishing trip and told Hop Pop to be with his grandson when he was spending more time with her.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nSylvia is a skinny light green frog with a pale yellow underbelly. Like the other frogs, she has four fingers and two toes on both her hands and feet respectively. She has grey hair that is pulled back into a long ponytail. She has light pink lipstick on and pink circles on her cheeks. Her eyes however are two tiny black dots and wears a pair of light blue glasses with pointed tips at the end.\n\nIn \"[[Hop Pop and Lock]]\", she wore a plain pink dress with a flower on the top while in \"[[Family Fishing Trip]]\" she wore white sun pants a yellow shirt and a cyan neckerchief. Her hair was also pulled up into a bun at the top.\n\n==Trivia==\n* While she playfully teased both Hop Pop and Monroe, it is obvious that she preferred Hop Pop for being \"weird\".\n* Besides [[Anne Boonchuy|Anne]], Sylvia is also considered part of the Plantar Family despite not being directly related.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nHop Pop and Lock 1.png\nFamily Fishing Trip 1.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*[[w:c:amphibiapedia:Sylvia Sundew|Sylvia Sundew]] at the [[w:c:amphibiapedia:Main Page|Amphibia Wiki]]\n\n{{Amphibia}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Amphibia characters]]\n[[Category:Frogs]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Grandparents]]\n[[Category:Parents]]"
