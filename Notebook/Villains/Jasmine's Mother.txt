She was the mother of [[Jasmine]]\u00a0and the ruler of [[Agrabah]]\u00a0alongside her husband the [[Sultan]],\u00a0prior to her death.\n==Background==\nThe Sultana is absent from the original film, only being mentioned by the Sultan, who notes how his wife wasn't as \"picky\" as their daughter when it came to selecting a suitor.\n\nIn the episode \"[[Garden of Evil]]\" of the ''[[Aladdin (TV series)|Aladdin]]'' animated series, it was revealed that the Sultan had taken a flower out of the garden for his new bride; referring to her.\n\nIn the film ''[[Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: Follow Your Dreams]]'', the Sultana was revealed to have owned a horse named [[Sahara]]. Surprisingly, the horse is aggressive\u00a0and doesn't allow any other rider to mount him, aside from the Sultana\u00a0herself. Even the Sultan is at risk when approaching Sahara, only being tolerated because their interaction is used for the Sultan to provide Sahara with his daily apple.\n\nSeveral books\u00a0mention the Sultana and the legacy she has left behind:\u00a0In the ''Tales of Agrabah'' chapter book, Jasmine is shown to longingly gaze into the starry night sky whenever the memories of her deceased mother stir her saddened emotions. This is a result of the Sultana having told stories of the \"Tiger star named Rajah\". When her daughter adopted a tiger cub, she named him [[Rajah]] as a result of this.\n\nIn the book ''Jasmine's Royal Wedding'', it is revealed that, before she died, Sultana wrote out a letter for Jasmine to read in the wake of her own wedding. Part of the letter included the Sultana mentioning her gratitude for having found her \"treasure of all treasures\" and showing happiness that Jasmine has found her own. The Sultana's \"treasure\" was truly the Sultan\u00a0himself. Jasmine's love for her mother was the driving motivation to have her own wedding modeled after her mother's.\n\nIn the [[2019]] [[Aladdin (2019 film)|live-action remake]], Jasmine's mother is referred to as \"the Queen\" rather than Sultana. She comes from the South Asian-inspired Kingdom of Sherabad, which [[Jafar]] wanted to conquer to expand Agrabah. She also is mentioned to have been the victim of murder, which caused her husband to keep their daughter\u00a0inside the palace for protection. It is hinted that Jafar may be responsible for her death, for he was very keen on taking over Sherabad.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The Sultana was an artist.<ref name=\"JRW\">''Jasmine's Royal Wedding'', page 23.</ref>\n*In the same way as [[Ariel]] baring a striking resemblance to her mother, [[Queen Athena]], Jasmine has the same resemblance to hers.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Aladdin}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Aladdin characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Queens]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Middle Eastern characters]]\n[[Category:Unseen characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]"
