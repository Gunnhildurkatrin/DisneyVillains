She is featured in the [[Disney Television Animation|Disney]] animated series, ''[[Gargoyles]]''.\n\n==Role in the [[Gargoyles|series]]==\nWhen Beth's older sister, Elisa, was shot, Beth was in Flagstaff, Arizona, attending school. Her family was unsure whether or not she would need to fly out to [[Manhattan]] to see her ailing sister. It seems she did not return to [[New York City]] because Elisa made a full recovery. She did, however, come out to visit shortly after the disappearance of her brother, [[Derek Maza]]. She was enjoying her sister's cooking when she noticed a winged figure at the window of Elisa's top-story apartment. Elisa made a joke, distracting Beth and their parents, returning the conversation to a jovial tone.\n\nWhen Elisa was \"enjoying\" her Avalon World Tour, one of her stops was at Flagstaff University, where Beth was studying her Native American cultural heritage. With Elisa, [[Angela]], and [[Goliath]], Beth helped put a stop to [[David Xanatos]]' construction that threatened to destroy a site honoring Coyote the Trickster, which proved part of a scheme to capture the [[Child of Oberon]] to force him to grant the billionaire immortality.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Beth fully appeared in [[Marvel Comics]]' ''Gargoyles'' before she did on the [[Gargoyles|television series]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nHug2.jpg\nBeth_MazaX.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*[http://gargwiki.net/Beth_Maza Beth Maza] at Garg Wiki\n\n{{Gargoyles}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Maza, Beth}}\n[[Category:Gargoyles characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Native American characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]"
