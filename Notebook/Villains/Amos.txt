Then one foggy day in November of 1573, Aramis Mouse, the adventurous oldest son sailed across the Thames River in a teacup. In 1523, Aloysius the painter observed from under the floor of the art studio of the famous German painter [[Wikipedia:Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein the Younger]] painting the [[Wikipedia:Portrait of Erasmus of Rotterdam|Portrait of Erasmus of Rotterdam]]. In the early 17th century, Amos' great, great, great grandfather Jason Mouse championed for the rights of mice, and prepared a petition, demanding that all cats be caged but it was ignored. In 1620, he and his family moved to the seaport in Southampton and onboard the ship ''Mayflower'' as he learned that all of passengers men and mice were on the same boat. They sailed and fled from the persecution and tyranny of the old country England. They found a new land America and settled called Plymouth Colony in Plymouth, [[Massachusetts]] that a new life in a new land was begun as they were free, but then, Jason heard \"meow\" and observed a cat carrying by a man that he didn't know. Finally, Amos begins for his life story as the same title.\n\nAmos is a poor church mouse who sets out to find work since his family of 26 is starving. In the winter of 1745, he's rejected by several places and takes refuge in the run-down print shop of Ben Franklin. Quickly, he gives Ben the ideas for the Franklin stove, bifocal lenses, and the newspaper the Pennsylvania Gazette as Ben's creditors are threatening to shut him down in 24 hours. The paper is an instant hit and Ben prospers. With Amos hidden in his hat prompting him, Ben seems much brighter than he is. However, when Amos is attached to Ben's kite and gets hit by lightning with rain, he leaves. Later, in the summer of 1776, Ben is desperate and begs Amos to return. He agrees but only if Ben will sign a contract. The next day, as they are beginning their talks, Thomas Jefferson drops by for help with the wording the opening of the Declaration of Independence, and as Ben reads the opening words of the contract, Jefferson says, \"That's it!\"\n\nAmos's role in helping Ben Franklin was memorialized in mouse society through a placement of a statue of him on the hat of a Ben Franklin statue outside of Independence Hall.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Amos closely resembles [[Jaq and Gus|Jaq, Gus]] and several other [[mice]] from Disney's 1950 animated film [[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]] along with directing animators, [[Ward Kimball]] and [[Fred Moore]].\n\n==Gallery==\n===Concept Art===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\">\nAmos 3.jpg\nAmos 4.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\">\nAmos Walking.jpg\nAmos Reading.jpg|Amos reading the ''Pennsylvania Gazette'' newspaper about poor Benjamin who is forced to envoy for the British King.\nBen and me 11large.jpg|\"WAS IT ELECTRICITY!?\" Amos releasing a lightning bolt in his tongue when it hit accidentally by Ben.\nBen and me 6large.jpg\nBen and me 10large.jpg\nBen and me 8large.jpg\nBen and me 7large.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\">\nAmos Helping Ben.jpg\nAmos Opening an Ink Bottle.jpg\nAmos Sitting.jpg\nAmos 1.jpg\nAmos 2.jpg\nspade1.png\nAmos Epcot.jpg|Amos wall art at [[The American Adventure]] for 2018's Epcot Festival of the Arts.\n</gallery>\n\n[[ar:\u0622\u0645\u0648\u0633]]\n[[Category:Mice]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who narrate the story]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Males]]"
