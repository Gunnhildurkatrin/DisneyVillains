He does not speak in the strictest sense but is capable of communicating with others, like [[Ellie Mae]], and the [[Swamp Folk]]. His personality is not well developed, but he does seem to be helpful and courageous.\n\n==Appearances ==\n\n=== [[The Rescuers|''The Rescuers'']] ===\nWhen [[Bernard]] and [[Miss Bianca]] are in need of a boat to reach the riverboat, the location of [[Madame Medusa]]'s hideout, one of the locals, [[Ellie Mae]], recommends Evinrude to the pair, as he has the fastest boat around. Evinrude takes the pair to the riverboat and is later asked to round up the other local animals to take part in a rescue of [[Penny (The Rescuers)|Penny]], the young girl that was kidnapped by Medusa.\n\nEvinrude tries to return to Ellie Mae's but is forced to take cover from a swarm of bats. Later on, Evinrude makes the final trip, managing to land in Ellie Mae's coal stove. By this time, Ellie Mae has managed to gather up the neighbors, in wait of a call from Bernard and Bianca. Evinrude is initially too exhausted to give the message but is revived by Ellie Mae's husband, [[Luke]], by a drink, presumably moonshine.\n\nEvinrude leads the charge, and the group is able to successfully defeat Medusa and rescue Penny, [[Bernard (The Rescuers)|Bernard]], and [[Miss Bianca]]. Evinrude is later seen at the end of the film, accompanying Bernard and Bianca on another mission.\n\n=== [[The Rescuers Down Under|''The Rescuers Down Under'']] ===\nAccording to Storyboards for ''[[The Rescuers Down Under]]'', shown in the book ''[[Paper Dreams: The Art and Artists of Disney Storyboards]]'', show that Evinrude would've made a cameo at the end of that film, but it was scrapped for unknown reasons\n\n==[[Disney Parks]]==\nA walkaround version of Evinrude was produced for the film's original release and was seen at Disneyland and the Magic Kingdom, though has long since been retired. Years later, he could be seen on the ''Princess and the Frog'' float in [[Mickey's Soundsational Parade]].\n\n==Trivia==\n*Evinrude's name and design likely draw inspiration from a company called {{WikipediaLink|Evinrude Outboard Motors}}. Evinrude's method of maneuvering his boat (and the resulting sound), is similar to the outboard boat motors the company manufactures.\n*Upon being revived with [[Luke]]'s moonshine, he emits the same \"charging\" sound that a bee made in ''[[Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree]]''. Coincidentally, those bees were also voiced by [[Jimmy MacDonald]].\n\n==Gallery==\n\n=== Screenshots ===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nTumblr n9tiqtz5V51r3jmn6o1 1280.png\nTumblr nande2VPgs1r3jmn6o1 1280.png\nTumblr nb6rghJSQI1r3jmn6o1 1280.png\nRescuers-disneyscreencaps com-7541.jpg\nRescuers-disneyscreencaps com-7584.jpg\nRun.jpg\nRescuers-chase.jpg\nevinard.jpg\nevinrudeleaffall.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n=== Miscellaneous ===\n<gallery widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\n\n77 Rescuers cast.jpg|Evinrude and the cast of the Rescuers as they appeared at Disneyland in 1977.\n5778626678 f4dae826f7 z.jpg|Evinrude cameos in [[Mickey's Soundsational Parade]] on a float based on ''[[The Princess and the Frog]]''.\nFile:Rescuers Characters at Magic Kingdom.jpg|Evinrude and the cast at the [[Magic Kingdom]] in 1977.\nMarch31st.png|His [[Disneystrology]] page\nWalt-disney-20-usa-celluloids-from-the-rescuers-2-2953507.jpg|Evinrude production cell\nEvinwdcc1.jpg\nEvincell.jpg\nEvinrude.gif|Clip art of Evinrude\nBernardbiancaevinrude.gif\n\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Rescuers}}\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:The Rescuers characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Insects]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey's Soundsational Parade]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Servants]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
