She also gave a kiss to Luke, even though she said he was creepy for stalking her and filming her chest.\n==Abilities==\nShaylee has super strength, as she had grown up in the wild with eight brothers. She was able to throw McD a great distance, and is strong enough to crush a person. She can also throw an object like a pillow, use it to knock someone out, then have it return to her hand like a boomerang. She also mentioned biting a crocodile. Shaylee could also see that Luke wasn't pointing the camera at her face. She could also hear Jessie's liquified organs.\n\n==Personality==\nShaylee is a nice, caring, and kindhearted person. Although she is strong, she is not mean.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Michaels, Shaylee}}\n[[Category:Jessie characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Australian characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]"
