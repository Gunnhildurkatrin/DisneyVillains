He was [[Riley Daring]]'s boyfriend since \"The Perfect Date\", but broke up in \"Heartbreak in the Big City\", although, he wanted to start the relationship again in \"A Tale of Two Rileys\". He's a baseball player. He is voiced by\u00a0[[Dee Bradley Baker]].\n==Quotes==\n\"Seriously what did you think? That I was going to dump you for a super model or something?\"\n\n\"We'll You should've known better. Geez Riley.\"\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the episode \"[[Garage Sale Daring]]\", Johnny mentions that he has a brother. Unfortunately, his brother is never shown, but showed only his room. In \"[[Extra Credit]]\", Johnny has a little sister. This issue has not been explained by the writers, otherwise his brother may have been scrapped before \"Extra Credit\" and rather for Johnny to have a sister instead.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nRileyTackledJohnny.jpg|Johnny as he appeared in Season 2 with Riley\nChar 33892.jpg\nRiley asks Johnny Hittswell is He Dumping Her.PNG\nJohnny Hitswell tells Riley This isn't a Good Time.PNG|Johnny tells Riley this isn't a good time\nCinnamon boots bouquet much.png\n</gallery>\n==References==\n<references />\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{The Replacements}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hitswell, Johnny}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:The Replacements characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
