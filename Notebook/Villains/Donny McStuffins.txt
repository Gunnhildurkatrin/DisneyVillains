Donny is a curious and playful boy with an adventurous imagination and many great friends his age: Luca, Will, and Alma. Luca is his best friend, while [[Alma]], who is the little sister of [[Emmie]], is his neighbor. Also, his favorite toys are Robot Ray, [[Sir Kirby]], Ricardo Racecar and Glo-Bo. Doc acts like a big sister to Donny, even when his toys don't work.\n\n==Personality==\nDonny is very playful and curious. He loves playing with his big sister, Doc and his toys, especially the kids his age. In the episode \"[[Ben/Anna Split!]]\", when Donny accidentally rips Ben's hugging sticker off from a rosebush thorn, he shows Alma, feeling sorry to her. Also in the episode \"[[Run Down Race Car]]\", Donny is tired from racing Ricardo Racecar last night and has to go inside to take a nap before Luca comes to play.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nDoc_Brother.jpg\nDonny&Doc.jpg\nDoc mcstuffins family.jpg\nDoc-McStuffins-05.jpg\nStuffyDocDonnyLambie.jpg\nDonnyMr. ChompsBronty -Mr. Chomps Chompers.png\nDonny_the_Turtle_Trooper.png\nDoc-mcstuffins-jaden-betts.png\nDonny_and_his_Ukulele.png\nDonny's pricked arm.jpg\nDoc and donny holding stuffed toys.jpg\nDonny and teddy b.jpg\nDonny, lambie, chilly and teddy b.jpg\nDoc and donny giggling.jpg\nMaxresdefault 219.jpg\n901bfbfce464bd236a74fada9451edb30f99e6e22e6bbdbaafe3ec10d0639389 large.jpg\nDoc-McStuffins-Season-1-Episode-26-Bronto-Boo-Boos--Brontosaurus-Breath.jpg\nDoc-McStuffins-Season-1-Episode-5-Gulpy-Gulpy-Gators--One-Note-Wonder.jpg\nDoc-McStuffins-Season-1-Episode-4-Engine-Nine-Feelin--Fine--The-Right-Stuff.jpg\nDoc, donny and demitri.jpg\nDoc, donny and friends through the binoculars.jpg\nDonny balloon.jpg\nDoc, donny and winnie.jpg\nLogan-doc-1-tvgm.jpg\nWill and donny.jpg\nDocDonnycuddle.png\nRunaway Love-062.jpg\nRunaway Love-061.jpg\nRunaway Love-058.jpg\nRunaway Love-056.jpg\nRunaway Love-055.jpg\nRunaway Love-054.jpg\nRunaway Love-053.jpg\n</gallery>\n{{Doc McStuffins}}\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Doc McStuffins characters]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Cousins]]\n[[Category:Males]]"
