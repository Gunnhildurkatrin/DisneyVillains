They are a pair of fighter jets who are good friends with [[Dusty Crophopper]], an aspiring fan of theirs.\n\n==Background==\nArmed with stellar instincts, incredible aerial abilities and outstanding service records, Bravo and Echo are two of the Jolly Wrenches\u2019 top troops. These fighter jets happen to be avid air racing fans, too, with a special affinity for Dusty, who\u2019s adopted their Jolly Wrenches insignia. And as far as the racers are concerned, it doesn\u2019t hurt to have a couple soldiers nearby should any plane falter under the immense pressure of the world\u2019s most rigorous rally.<ref name=\"sk\">[http://www.stitchkingdom.com/disney-planes-official-character-descriptions-casting-character-poses-hires-61766/ \u2018Planes\u2019 Official Character Descriptions, Casting and Character Poses (Hi-Res)]</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Planes]]''===\nIn the ''Planes'' teaser trailer (which contains animation not in the film), both Bravo and Echo appear. After\u00a0Dusty Crophopper\u00a0takes off and was having a bit of trouble flying, Bravo asks Echo if Dusty will be okay. Dusty was then seen skywriting \"Cool\", with Echo replying that he thinks Dusty will be okay.\n\nIn the actual film, they are seen trying to get Dusty towards [[Planes#Dwight D. Flysenhower|Dwight D. Flysenhower]] when he gets low on fuel and lost over the Pacific Ocean after losing his navigation antenna that was destroyed by [[Ned and Zed]]. After Dusty lands on the ship, all of the crew give him some fuel and a new antenna, and Bravo and Echo show Dusty the Jolly Wrenches Hall of Fame, and try to get to Dusty ready when he asks on the radio if it is true that [[Skipper Riley]] flew only one mission. Bravo and Echo are later seen at the end with Dusty and Skipper on Dwight as they fly together.\n\n==Video game appearances==\n===''[[Planes: The Video Game]]''===\nIn ''[[Planes: The Video Game]]'', Bravo and Echo both appear in the console version, but only Echo is playable in the handheld version.\n\n==Trivia==\n*On Bravo's sides are the numbers \"113\", possibly a reference to [[A113]], a running gag in many films including [[Pixar]] films. Also, it is [[Mater]]'s license plate.\n*Bravo and Echo are voiced by [[Val Kilmer]] and [[Anthony Edwards]], who played \"Iceman\" and \"Goose\", respectively, in the movie ''Top Gun''. Their helmet designs are also the same as the ones used by Goose and Iceman.\n*They are modeled after Boeing F/A-18E Super Hornets, famously shown in films like ''Independence Day''. They are also similar to the Grumman F-14 Tomcat, famous from the movie ''Top Gun''.\n**In fact, F/A-18E Super Hornets would later appear in the upcoming ''Top Gun: Maverick'' sequel, which is set for release in November 19, 2021 after being delayed several times due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n*A Japanese actor named Tomomitsu Yamaguchi (\u5c71\u53e3\u667a\u5145) is the voice of Bravo in the Japanese version of ''Planes'', and is the same actor who voiced Mater in the Japanese versions of ''[[Cars]]'' and ''[[Cars 2]]''.\n*Bravo and Echo are based in a NATO alphabet namely BE\n\n==Quotes==\n===From ''Planes''===\n{{Quote 2|'''Bravo:''' \"Unknown rider, unknown rider.
