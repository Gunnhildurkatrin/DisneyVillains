She appeared in the ''[[Hercules (TV series)|Hercules]]'' animated series episode \"[[Hercules and the Prince of Thrace]]\".\n==Trivia==\n*In the original myths, Gaia was not simply the mother of Disney's version of the Titans: she was also the mother of [[Kronos]] and the twelve original Titans. Kronos' children in these myths ([[Zeus (Hercules)|Zeus]], [[Poseidon]], [[Hades]], [[Hera]], [[Demeter]], and [[Hestia]]) were among her grandchildren. She was also related to many of the gods through Zeus.\n*She and Uranus were mentioned in the Norwegian language version of ''The Gospel Truth I.'' The lyric goes, \"En gang i fordums tid, v\u00e5r unge jord var enn\u00e5 i sjokk. For Uranos' og Gaias tolv titaner gikk amok!\" (\"Once upon a time, our young earth was still in shock. For the twelve titans of Uranus and Gaia went mad!\")\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"170\" captionalign=\"left\">\nGaiaFullView.jpg\ngaiadisney3.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Hercules}}\n[[Category:Greek Mythology]]\n[[Category:Greek characters]]\n[[Category:Immortal]]\n[[Category:Queens]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Hercules characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Character stubs]]\n[[Category:Goddesses]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Titans]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Grandparents]]"
