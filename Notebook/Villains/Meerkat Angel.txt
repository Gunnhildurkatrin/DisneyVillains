He is voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]].\n\n==Background==\n===Physical Description===\nThe meerkat angel is a large meerkat with light purple fur and dark purple hair. He has black eyes. He also has black ears with dark purple canals and wears a white robe, a gray-purple tunic, and glasses.\n\n===Personality===\nThe meerkat angel seems overall devoid of any personality. His very existence is to objectively judge people for their time on earth and send them to either Heaven or Hell. However, because his judgments are based on the majority of what a person has done, rather than individual actions, his decisions are sometimes harsh, as in [[Timon|Timon's]] case, who almost got sent to Hell simply because he called people \"mooks\" all his life. However, he can give people second chances if they do one good deed. After doing so, when they die again, they will go to Heaven.\n\n==Appearances==\n===\"[[Timon's Time Togo]]\"===\nAfter [[Timon]] eats a poisonous bug, he appears in front of the meerkat angel. The angel looks through a book detailing Timon's life to determine whether to send him to Heaven or Hell. After discovering that Timon spent most of his time calling people \"mooks\", he decided he was not eligible to enter Heaven. \n\nHowever, before being sent to Hell, Timon asked the angel for a second chance. The angel then agreed to send Timon back to earth to perform a good deed to redeem himself.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Jeff Bennett, who provides the meerkat angel's voice, also voiced [[Zazu]] in the Morning Report segment of the original \"[[The Lion King|Lion King]] and in [[The Lion Guard]]. He was also [[Iron Joe]] in [[The Lion King 1\u00bd]], as well as various other voices in [[Timon & Pumbaa]], including the beast, Buzz, and the [[Castaway (Timon and Pumbaa)|castaway]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nMeerkat Angel 1.png\nMeerkat Angel 2.png|The meerkat angel with Timon at Heaven\nMeerkat Angel 3.png|The meerkat angel straightening his glasses\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Lion King}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Timon & Pumbaa characters]]\n[[Category:Meerkats]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Angels]]"
