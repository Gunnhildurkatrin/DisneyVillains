He spent most of the episode \"[[Hooray for Hollywuz]]\" ordering his Dogrilla (dog-gorilla) security to throw the persistent but unwanted Hoppo out of the studio. He does not seem to be able to say anything without squawking loudly at some point during the sentence.\n[[Category:Wuzzles characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Parrots]]\n[[Category:Foxes]]\n[[Category:Hybrids]]"
