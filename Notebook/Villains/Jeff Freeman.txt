But after his mysterious disappearance for 8 years, Jeff shows how much he really cared about\u00a0him by helping in Bill and Helen's search for him, feeling bad that the last time they met is when he scared him by jumping out of a tree when he goes to pick him up.\n\nWhen Jeff meets David again, he is just as surprised to see him as he is by him and helps him understand where he is and what has changed. He goes to great lengths to help him out including lighting a fireworks display so he can find his way home.\n\nWhen David returns to [[1978]], Jeff is amazed when he forgives him for his teasing and eventually warms up to him.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFlight-of-the-navigator-disneyscreencaps_com-1732.jpg|Jeff at 16 years\n</gallery>\n\n{{Flight of the Navigator}}\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Flight of the Navigator characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]"
