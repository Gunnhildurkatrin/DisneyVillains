He is a stray mutt who falls in love with a Cocker Spaniel named [[Lady]] and they embark on many adventures together.\n\n==Background==\n===Development===\nIn early versions of the script, Tramp was called Homer and although he was first conceived as Lady's suitor, competing with an early incantation of [[Boris (Lady and the Tramp)|Boris]] for her affections, he ended up as her ex-dog pound mate in the final [[1943]] storyboard pitch. A few years after that version was scrapped, [[Walt Disney]] read a short story called \"Happy Dan the Cynical Dog\" in Cosmopolitan Magazine and decided that such a character as him was just was needed to enhance the film. Although Walt wanted his new character to be called Tramp, the animators feared that audiences would take offense in such a name, due to the word's sexual connotations (\"the lady is a tramp\".) So, they first called him Rags, then Bozo, before Walt insisted that Tramp would be fine.\n\n===Personality===\nIn the first film, Tramp is very laid-back and he's more like a kid, he enjoys his rapscallion lifestyle without a family and home, it's implied that he's flirtatious, given his history of having a multitude of girlfriends, he's known for his street smarts, able to both avoid dogcatchers and deal with junkyard dogs. He initially seems cynical about humans, saying how the arrival of a baby is likely to lead to the family dog being pushed aside.\n\nIn the sequel, after Tramp and Lady have married and now have a litter of four puppies, he has grown accustomed to being a house pet, but still retains his street smarts. He is also portrayed as being a loving yet firm father to his son, [[Scamp]], and daughters, [[Annette, Collette and Danielle]].\n\n===Physical appearance===\nTramp is a medium-sized, scruffy-looking dog. He is mostly medium brown with a light tan muzzle and stomach. He has a cream-colored stripe that comes down from his muzzle to his chest (which he passes down to his son, Scamp, and daughter, Danielle) after he is taken in by [[Jim Dear]] and [[Darling]], he wears a red collar with a diamond-shaped license.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lady and the Tramp]]''===\n[[File:Tramp-disneyscreencaps.com-1487.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Tramp starts his day in the first film.]]\nTramp is introduced as a wise-cracking, stray mutt who admires the life of a rogue loner. Often seen alone, he doesn't appear to have family or friends outside of the local mutts he runs into from time to time, such as [[Peg]] and [[Bull]], or [[Tony and Joe]], two Italian restaurant owners. Nevertheless, he lives his life with a carefree aura and rascally-fun nature. While out and about in New Haven, where he regularly rests and feasts at various restaurants, he overhears [[Jock]] and [[Trusty]] attempting to explain what a baby is to Lady. He gives his opinion on the matter, which is somewhat negative. Annoyed with him, Jock and Trusty order him out of the yard.\n\nLater on, Tramp rescues Lady, whom he calls \"Pidge\" from a pack of alley dogs. She reveals that she has been muzzled, and so he attempts to help her take it off. He takes her to the zoo when he is able to manipulate a [[Mr. Busy|beaver]] into removing it, by claiming it will help him haul logs. That night, Tramp takes Lady out for a night on the town. He reveals that he goes to different houses for scraps and that he has a different name at every one of them. That night, he takes Lady to a [[Tony's Restaurant|small Italian restaurant]], where they are served spaghetti and meatballs by the owner, Tony. He decides to take her [[Lady's House|home]], but she is picked up by [[The Dogcatcher|the dogcatcher]].\n\nAfter he finds Lady, who has been released from the [[Dog Pound|pound]], he attempts to apologize to her, but she angrily confronts him on rumors she heard at the pound regarding his multiple past girlfriends. She forced him to leave, and he's very sad, no thanks to her rejection, and left dejected. As he sadly left, Lady peaks out from her doghouse for him, looking guilty for being too hard on him. However, he soon hears her barking furiously as if she's in trouble and rushes back. She alerts to him that a [[The Rat|rat]] has entered [[Jim, Jr.|the baby]]'s room, and so he rushes to stop it. During the fight, he accidentally knocks over the crib, waking the baby and making him cry, but is able to kill the rat, only to be found by [[Aunt Sarah]], who decides to call the dogcatcher and have him take Tramp to the pound. However, he is released due to the combined efforts of Jock and Trusty, who had overheard the humans talking after they discovered the rat that he killed and realized they were wrong about him from beginning to end.\n\nThe next Christmas, it's revealed that Tramp has been made a member of the family by Jim Dear and Darling as a reward for his heroism. He and Lady have become the parents of four puppies; three girls that look identical to her and a son that looks identical to him. He's happy to be a house dog instead of a stray, now that he's with her. Jock and Trusty, who came to visit the family for Christmas, expressed admiration  for his new collar like they did with Lady from the beginning.\n\n===''[[Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure]]''===\n[[File:Ladyandthetramp2_534.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Tramp in the sequel]]\nThe second film shows that Tramp's relationship with his son, [[Scamp]], has become somewhat strained due to his desire to be a \"wild dog\". One day, he makes a mess in the living room and is chained up outside. Even though, Tramp makes an accident to him since he can't stop acting wild on the street. Tramp comes to talk to him, but they soon get into an argument and Tramp leaves.\n\nLater on, Scamp runs away from home and Tramp blames himself for him leaving home because he was too harsh with him. He realizes that he needs to understand him better. After he joins a dog pack known as the \"Junkyard Dogs\", he learns of Tramp's famous reputation as a former street dog. Unknown to him, the pack's leader, [[Buster (Lady and the Tramp)|Buster]], was once Tramp's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, and now seeks revenge on him. Buster later learns that Scamp is his son.\n\nWhen Scamp is asked by Buster to steal a chicken from his owners' Fourth of July picnic, Tramp soon arrives and talk softly to him. He asks him to come home, but he confronts him who he was as a stray and chooses the junkyard life. Tramp feels sad and brokenhearted that he does not want to be a house dog. However, later that night, one of the Junkyard Dogs, [[Angel (Lady and the Tramp)|Angel]], arrives and tells him and Lady that Scamp is in trouble and is in the pound. He and Angel race to the pound and Tramp saves him from getting killed by a vicious bull mastiff named [[Reggie]], who Scamp encountered earlier before he got caught by [[the Dogcatcher|the dogcatcher]] for as he claimed he attacked his vehicle. Later, he apologizes to Tramp for running away from home, and he in return apologizes to Scamp for being too hard on him. He was thinking that they can go to the river to howl, promising to lighten up and claiming his old man still has a few howls left in him, right before Jock and Trusty found them. Afterward, they reconcile and head home after Scamp retrieves his collar from Buster back at [[The Junkyard|the junkyard]] and had him trapped in a pile of junk as a score for what he did to him. In the end, the family adopts Angel and Tramp is happy that Scamp became a house dog instead of being a stray after all.\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\n[[File:House Of Mouse - Jiminy Cricket.jpg|thumb|250px|Tramp and Lady in ''House of Mouse'']]\nTramp makes several appearances as a guest in the television series ''[[House of Mouse]]'', usually sitting with Lady. Most of their scenes mimic the spaghetti scene from the film.\n\nIn \"[[Dining Goofy]]\" Tramp and Lady were used as examples for [[Ludwig Von Drake]]'s new dining options.\n\nIn \"[[Humphrey in the House]]\", Tramp and Lady's spaghetti dinner was stolen by [[Humphrey the Bear]].\n\nTramp was referenced in the episode \"[[The Mouse Who Came to Dinner]]\", during the celebrity roast; as the joke went, Lady was looking for him, to which [[Goofy]] exclaims, \"Hey, Lady, I found the Tramp!\" as a jab at [[Mortimer Mouse]].\n\n===Other appearances===\nIn ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'', Tramp and Lady make a cameo during the [[Twilight Bark]] scene, as does [[Jock]] and [[Peg]].\n\nTramp and Lady make a cameo appearance at the end of \"[[This is Your Life, Donald Duck (animation)|This is Your Life, Donald Duck]]\".\n\nLady and Tramp make a cameo appearance in the ''[[Bonkers]]'' episode \"[[CasaBonkers]]\". They are briefly seen eating spaghetti together at the Rubber Room.\n\nIn the first ''[[Kingdom Hearts (game)|Kingdom Hearts]]'', [[Traverse Town]] has three districts. In the third one, one can spot a fountain of Lady and Tramp.\n\nTramp and Lady make a cameo appearance in the forms of silhouettes at the end of ''[[The Lion King 1\u00bd]]''.\n\nTramp and Lady make a cameo appearance along with in the ''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]'' episode \"[[Third Wheel]]\".\n\nA screencap of Tramp appears along with the [[Sorcerer Hat]] within [[Oh My Disney]] in ''[[Ralph Breaks the Internet]]''.\n\nIn the series finale of ''[[At Home With Olaf]]'', a short clip of ''Lady and the Tramp'' featuring Tramp and Lady appears during a montage of heartwarming moments from Disney films playing in [[Olaf]]'s song \"[[I Am with You]]\".\n\n==Live-action appearances==\n===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===\nTramp, portrayed by Garry Garneau, makes a cameo appearance in human form, in the Season 4 episode \"[[The Apprentice]]\" as a customer of the Italian restaurant where [[Emma Swan]] and [[Captain Hook]] share a romantic dinner. He shares the famous spaghetti kiss with Lady, herself in human form. Knowing that other animals like [[Jiminy Cricket]] and [[Jaq and Gus|Gus]] are transformed into humans by [[the Evil Queen]]'s curse, it was plausibly effective also for him.\n\n=== [[Lady and the Tramp (2019 film)|''Lady and the Tramp'' (2019)]] ===\n[[File:Lady and the Tramp (2019) - Tramp.jpeg|thumb|Tramp in ''Lady and the Tramp (2019)'']]\nTramp appears in the [[2019]] film remake, voiced by [[Justin Theroux]].\n\nTramp first appears exploring the world around him in a train yard where a railroad foreman wards him off as he could be a distraction to them. Escaping from him, he wanders around the streets and sees a man eating a sandwich to which he distracts a woman in order to get it from the man (causing her to break up with him) just as he decides to eat lunch. Hearing two stray dogs sad and hungry, he gives the sandwich to them. Afterwards, he sees Elliott, the dogcatcher, alerting people that any unlicensed dog will be immediately impounded to which he hears that two captured dogs named Bull and Peg were captured for trying to steal meat from the butcher shop despite them being hungry, while Elliott asks a storekeeper to put a poster about the alert on his window to which he refuses to. Tramp manages to rescue Bull and Peg while Elliott and the storekeeper continue their conversation. As they talk to him, he tells them that they would always get caught whenever they grab meat from the butcher shop just as Elliott arrives toward his wagon and prepares to take him to the dog pound to which he tricks him and rescues Bull and Peg to get meat from the butcher shop. Having rescued them, he talks to two poodles to know if they are twins to which the male is the female's husband. Elliott chases him across the street to which he escapes from him and ends up in Jim Dear's family's home. There, he meets an upset Lady who thinks he is Trusty where Elliott overhears their argument to which he tells Jim Dear that he is looking for the stray dog he is attempting to capture. After their argument ends, Lady asks for advice from Tramp who tells her that a baby in Jim Dear's family will replace her to which she hears [[Jock|Jacqueline]] telling her to stay away from Tramp to which he continues his conversation with her. Trusty and Jacqueline arrive telling her that they will take care of the problem by warding him off to which Lady calls him a street dog. Offended, he leaves without provoking anyone.\n\nAfter Lady is given a muzzle to keep herself from being a nuisance to Jim Dear's family, she encounters [[Isaac (Lady and the Tramp)|Isaac]], a street dog trying to keep her away to which Tramp intervenes with him. In order to rescue her, Tramp whispers to Isaac that she is infected by rabies to which she pretends to be so to scare him off. Having rescued her, she offers Tramp to remove the muzzle to which they go to the zoo to do so. Arriving there, she suggests him to remove it by using a beaver statue to pull it off.\n\nHaving pulled the muzzle off her mouth, Lady asks Tramp to take her home to which she has trouble finding her way to which he warns her that the city is very dangerous because of vehicles that can accidentally run over dogs. Thinking about Jim Dear and Darling missing her, she and Tramp plan to escape from Elliott to which they use a steamboat to escape from him.\n\nHaving escaped from Elliott, Lady and Tramp explore a park at night. She tells him that she is sure she has a home to which she can return. He shows empathy for her.  He proposes her to eat something. For this purpose, they goes to his favorite restaurant, \"Tony's\" where he barks at a chef named Joe to serve food for them where Joe gets his boss, Tony, to do so. Having a romantic dinner, Tony and Joe perform the song \"[[Bella Notte]]\" to serenade them. Afterward, they walk around the park in a quiet night and fall in love (a scene by the fountain where she hugs him).\n\nTramp tells Lady that he wants to show her something. They race down the hillside laughing where he shows the city view from the hill. She's enchanted with him. He howls and wants her to do the same; after the initial failure, she succeeds. She tells him that she feels bad about having left her family. He explains to her that he knows how much it hurts to be abandoned. She guesses that he had a home, and he says, \"Yeah, I did.\". During the flashback, it is known that he once did so - his owner took him for a car ride and abandoned him. He waited in that spot all day and all night for his owner to come back, but he never did. After the flashback, he explains to Lady that if he was still with his owner, he would have never met her. However, their romantic moment is suddenly disrupted when Elliott prepares to capture him once again as they end up in the train yard to which while losing the railroad foreman and Elliott, he notices that she is being brought to the dog pound, separating her from him once again.\n\nWhen Lady finds herself in the dog pound, she talks with Peg who knows about the dog who rescued her from there once to which the one who encountered her and Bull is known as \"Tramp\".\n\nLady is taken from the pound by Jim Dear and Darling. Although everything is going well, she is beginning to miss Tramp.\n\nLady also feels longing as Tramp falls into depression. Just then, he suddenly finds out that Peg and Bull have found homes. Talking with them, he grieves about Lady wanting to see her again to which he decides to apologize to her. Some time later, he arrives in her garden and apologizes for leaving her aside as she is happy to have them reunited again. He tells her to go on new adventures to which she tells him that she is part of Jim Dear's family and should stay with them.\n\nTramp reacts sadly, saying that Lady deserves it. She states that he deserves love. She then regrets that they can't be together to which he walks away, heartbroken.\n\nHowever, Lady sees a rat in her owners' house and warns Tramp to take care of it to which he plans to do so. He goes to Lulu's room to take care of it to protect her. As Elliott notices this only to find out that he killed it, he is captured to be brought back to the pound once again. Lady, Trusty, and Jacqueline arrive to help rescue him to which Lady causes the horses on the dogcatcher's wagon to panic just as it collapses and she walks over to Tramp's motionless body.\n\nJim Dear and Darling look at Tramp who was badly injured during to his fight with the rat. They talk to Elliott that he helped save Lulu from it to which he and Lady are finally reunited just as he is accepted to be in Jim Dear's family. Some time later during Christmas Day, he and the other dogs become part of Jim Dear's family.\n\n==[[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Disney Parks]]==\n[[File:IMG_9983.png|thumb|250px|Tramp and Lady's cameo in World of Color]]\n===[[Disneyland Resort]]===\nIn [[World of Color]], Tramp was seen enjoying spaghetti with Lady during the \"[[So Close]]\" scene at [[Disney California Adventure]].\n\n===[[Walt Disney World]]===\nTramp can be seen in [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]]' version of [[Fantasmic!]] during the floating bubble montage.\n\nAt the [[Magic Kingdom]], Tramp and other characters from the film are prominently featured at [[Tony's Town Square Restaurant]]. Also, Tramp and Lady briefly appear in [[Once Upon a Time (fireworks show)|Once Upon a Time]], during [[Mrs. Potts]] narration.\n\nIn the spring, the [[Epcot]] Flower and Garden Festival features Lady and the Tramp topiaries.\n\nA section of the [[Disney's Pop Century Resort]] is dedicated to Tramp and Lady in the form of statues.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*He is street smart like [[Thomas O'Malley]] in ''[[The Aristocats]]''. The contrast is Thomas married [[Duchess]] and became the stepfather of her three kittens while Tramp married Lady and had puppies of his own.\n*Tramp's growls and snarls heard during his fight with the rat would later be reused in ''[[Old Yeller]]'' when [[Old Yeller (character)|the title character]] had rabies.\n*When Tramp tells Lady about the downsides of having a baby in the family, he says he's \"the voice of experience\". When he does so, it implies that he may have been disowned by his original owners because of a baby. This was explicitly shown in the [[Lady and the Tramp (2019 film)|2019 remake]].\n*Tramp's breed is possibly Schnauzer.\n*His name means a person who travels from place to place on foot in search of work, or as a vagrant or beggar.\n**It would also fit into his lifestyle on how he admired the life of a rogue loner and enjoyed his freedom before settling down to become a house pet.\n**Tramp and Lady both have eyes that are resembling that of [[Bambi (character)|Bambi]]'s.\n* In [[Italy]], Tramp's name has been established as Biagio il Randagio (literally Biagio the stray dog), which is also what Tony and Joe call him in this translation.\n\n{{Lady and the Tramp}}\n{{Bonkers}}\n{{DisneyTsumTsum}}\n{{Disney Emoji Blitz}}\n{{Mickey Mouse (TV series)}}\n\n[[es:Golfo]]\n[[fi:Kulkuri]]\n[[fr:Clochard]]\n[[it:Biagio]]\n[[ja:\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7]]\n[[nl:Vagebond]]\n[[pt-br:Vagabundo]]\n[[ru:\u0411\u0440\u043e\u0434\u044f\u0433\u0430]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Lady and the Tramp characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Fantasmic characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Wonderful World of Color]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Bonkers characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Keepers characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Tritagonists]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Once Upon a Time characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Celebrate the Magic characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse (TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Wreck-It Ralph cameos]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Disney Magic Kingdoms characters]]"
