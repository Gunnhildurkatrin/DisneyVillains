He made his debut in the [[2008]] film, ''[[Tinker Bell (film)|Tinker Bell]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Tinker Bell (film)|Tinker Bell]]''===\nIn the original ''Tinker Bell'', Cheese is one of the many mice in Pixie Hollow who serve as helpers of the Tinker-talent fairies. Upon meeting Tinker Bell, he quickly takes a liking to her, and assists her in her attempt to capture sprinting thistles, though it backfires on her and causes much damage to Pixie Hollow. In spite of the destruction, Cheese follows Tinker Bell's plans to make things right in time for the fairies to travel to the Main Land to change the season.\n===''[[Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure]]''===\nCheese returns in the sequel to help the fairies prepare for the Autumn Revelry. In the beginning of the film, he assists Tinker Bell in testing her latest invention, the Pixie Dust Express.\n===''[[Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue]]''===\nLike many other residents in Pixie Hollow, Cheese travels to the mainland for Fairy Camp. When Tinker Bell is captured by humans, he helps her other friends in building a boat. In the end, when the fairies make peace with the humans that held Tink captive, Cheese joined the others during a picnic.\n===''[[Pixie Hollow Games]]''===\nCheese can be seen participating in some of the Pixie Hollow Game challenges. At one point, he was seen assisting Rosetta and her teammate, Chloe.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the original ''Tinker Bell'', Tink asked if the mouse's name was Cheese, and Bobble replied stating \"Must be. He always comes when we call it!\". This indicates that the mouse's actual name may not be Cheese and he only wants to eat cheese.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nTinker-bell.JPG|Tinker Bell riding Cheese.\nTink-mouse.JPG|Look at Tools\nTink-mouse2.JPG\nTinkerbell-great-fairy-rescue-disneyscreencaps com-8072.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Disney Fairies}}\n\n[[ru:\u0421\u044b\u0440]]\n[[Category:Disney Fairies characters]]\n[[Category:Mice]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"
