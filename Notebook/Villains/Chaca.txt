She is the daughter of [[Pacha]] and [[Chicha]].\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]''===\nChaca first appears in this film with her first brother Tipo during Pacha's return from his visit to [[Kuzco]]'s palace. They embrace their father warmly, and beg to stay awake past their bedtime, until being disturbed by the idea of having to watch their parents display affection.\n\nLater on, Tipo awakens from a nightmare involving Pacha, waking Chicha and garnering the attention of Chaca, as well. Chicha assures Tipo that Pacha is fine, leading to a childish bickering session between Chaca and Tipo.\n\nOne day, the family is visited by the wicked\u00a0[[Yzma]], who claims to be a relative of Pacha. When Pacha informs Chihca that Yzma has villainous intents, the family bands together to humiliate and rid their home of her, which buys Pacha time, as he's on a mission to save Kuzco from Yzma's plot to take over the kingdom.\n\nChaca is last seen during the \"[[Perfect World]]\" reprise, where she and her family celebrate the salvation of their village home, as Kuzco has had a change of heart over the idea of demolishing the area in favor of building a summer resort.\n\n===''[[Kronk's New Groove]]''===\nChaca plays a role in the sequel film, where she is featured as one of the campers in [[Kronk]]'s chipmunk troop.\n\n===''[[The Emperor's New School]]''===\nChaca makes multiple appearances in the television series along with Tipo and Yupi, often assisting Kronk when he needs it. She is also said to be a student of Kuzco Academy. She played a significant role in \"[[Faking the Grade]]\", where she is revealed to be a straight-A student, though on one rare occasion, she receives all D's while Kuzco (the complete opposite of her intellect) receives all A's.\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nEmperors-new-groove-disneyscreencaps.com-7131.jpg\nPapi31.png\nPapi36.png\nPapi37.png\nPapi38.png\nPapi39.png\nPapi40.png\nPapi47.png\nPapi48.png\nPapi79.png\nPapi118.png\nPacha and Chicha-Kronk's New Groove03.png\nPacha and Chicha-Kronk's New Groove02.png\nVlcsnap-2015-09-30-21h03m06s451.png\nVlcsnap-2015-09-26-21h54m47s227.png\nVlcsnap-2015-09-28-18h04m12s466.png\nVlcsnap-2015-09-28-18h23m45s450.png\nVlcsnap-2015-09-30-21h05m12s697.png\nClash of the Families.png\nVlcsnap-2015-09-30-21h07m30s913.png\nVlcsnap-2015-09-30-21h08m23s252.png\nKuzco Pacha family palace.JPG\nDVG Chaca.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Emperor's New Groove}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:The Emperor's New Groove characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Scouts]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Peruvian characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]\n[[Category:Native American characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
