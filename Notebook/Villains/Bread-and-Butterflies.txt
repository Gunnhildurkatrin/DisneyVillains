When aloft, they keep close together, and at rest, they huddle up forming a loaf of bread.\n\n==Role in the film==\nThe Bread-and-Butterflies appear when [[Alice]] explores the flower garden. [[Meadow of Living Flowers|The Red Rose]] introduces them by name. They are later seen during the musical number \"[[All in the Golden Afternoon]]\" where they fly through across a group of tulips, kissing them and later where the daffodils try to catch them. They are last seen taking Alice to the patch of pansies where she sings the final chorus.\n\n==Differences from the source material==\n*In the original story, the Bread-and-Butterfly is described as an insect with a lump of sugar for its head and crust for its body and is said to live on weak tea with cream on it. However, in the 1951 Disney adaptation of the story, the Bread-and-Butterfly is a butterfly with wings of bread and butter spread on it.\n\n==Trivia==\n*A Bread-and-Butterfly makes a cameo in the ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' Special Edition DVD on one of the menus but does not appear in the film itself. Considering that the film takes place in 1947 and ''Alice in Wonderland'' debuted 4 years later, its absence would make sense.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nAlice and Others - Walt Disney World Commercial.jpg|Alice and Others in a Walt Disney World commercial\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*[http://aliceinwonderland.fandom.com/wiki/Bread-and-Butterfly Bread-and-Butterfly] on [http://aliceinwonderland.fandom.com/wiki/ Alice in Wonderland Wiki]\n\n{{Alice in Wonderland}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Alice in Wonderland characters]]\n[[Category:Insects]]\n[[Category:Butterflies]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Foods]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]"
