He is one of the members of the Magic High Commission.\n==Background==\nNot much about Rhombulus' past is known, but he is part of the Magic High Commission and created by Glossaryck. He also imprisoned Eclipsa, the Queen of Darkness (Star's ninth great-grandmother).\n\n===Personality and Traits===\nRhombulus has a very short temper and will quickly engage those he thinks have insulted him. Rhombulus' snake hands have minds of their own, and they sometimes act as the voice of reason for Rhombulus' reckless ideas.\n\n===Physical Appearance===\nRhombulus is a muscular creature with diamond-shaped crystal for a head and eye, and snake arms. These particular items were all that remained of him after magic was erased at the end of the final episode.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Rhombulus' name is a portmanteau of \"rhombus\", a four-sided shape, and Romulus, the legendary founder of Rome.\n*According to ''[[Star and Marco's Guide to Mastering Every Dimension]]'', Rhombulus was created by [[Glossaryck]] to serve as the Magic High Commission's muscle.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\">\nCrystal Clear Concept Art - Rhombulus 1.png\nCrystal Clear Concept Art - Rhombulus 3.png\nCrystal Clear Concept Art - Rhombulus 2.png\nButterfly Trap 7.png|Admitting he has a crush on Queen Moon\nCrystal Clear concept 5.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*{{Interwiki|https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/star-and-the-forces-of-evil/images/6/64/Favicon.ico|starvstheforcesofevil|Rhombulus|Star vs. the Forces of Evil Wiki}}\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Star vs. the Forces of Evil}}\n\n[[nl:Rhombulus]]\n[[Category:Star vs. the Forces of Evil characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Immortal]]\n[[Category:Those brought back to life]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Snakes]]"
