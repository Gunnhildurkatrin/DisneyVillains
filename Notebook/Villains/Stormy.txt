She is the younger sister of [[Marina]], another mermaid.\n\n==Personality==\nUnlike her sister Marina, Stormy is very lazy, air-headed, and somewhat selfish, much like the mermaids from the original ''[[Peter Pan (film)|Peter Pan]]'' film. She was originally rather rude to [[Jake]], [[Izzy]], [[Cubby]], [[Skully]], and her sister [[Marina]]. To avoid doing work, Stormy would brainwash others to do the work for her using the powerful siren song called \"The Mermaid's Song\", but Stormy often stays honest.\n\n==Role in the series==\nIn the episode \"[[The Mermaid's Song]]\", Marina asks Stormy to complete three mer-tasks for an upcoming event. However, Stormy openly refuses but decides to do them eventually. When Marina departs, Stormy uses the Mermaid Song to brainwash the treasure-seeking [[Captain Hook]] and forces him to find seashells. She then brainwashes [[Mr. Smee]] to collect seaweed and [[Cubby]]  to collect coconuts. Eventually, Stormy's brief partner-in-crime [[Snappy the Hermit Crab]] rushes off to warn Marina about her sister. When [[Jake (Pirate)]], [[Izzy]], and [[Skully]] arrived, [[Marina]] quickly informed them of the problem but told the young pirates to clap their hands to wake both Hook, Smee, and Cubby from the spell. Marina then demands Stormy's presence and the culprit mermaid apologizes for her actions.\n\nShe returns in \"[[Treasure of the Tides]]\" when the mermaids decide to make Izzy an honorary mermaid. Later that night, she joins the other mermaids when they crown Izzy \"Mermaid of the Year\". In \"Izzy's Trident Treasure\", she and Marina ask Izzy for help in finding King Neptune's legendary trident. She might have a small crush on Cubby.\n\nStormy appears again in the episode \"[[Cubby's Pet Problem]]\", where she joins Jake and his crew exploring the wonders of the Never Sea when the puny pirate team in countered a baby sea serpent they've named [[Slink]]. Stormy later returns in the episode when Cubby sneaks aboard the [[The Jolly Roger|Jolly Roger]] to rescue Slink from Captain Hook. She brings [[Slink's Mother]] to aid in the rescue.\n\nStormy attended Jake's birthday celebration with the rest of the Never Land friends in \"[[Jake's Birthday Bash!]]\"\n\nStormy and Marina make a brief cameo appearance in the episode \"[[Captain Who?]]\" When Captain Hook gets a whiff of the Forget-Me Flowers he forgets he is the captain of his crew. Sharky, Bones, and Mr. Smee enlist Jake and crew to help jog his memory.\n\nStormy and Marina reappear in the episode \"[[Sandy and the Clams]]\" taken part in the concert held by [[Sandy the Starfish|Sandy]] and his singing clam trio at Mermaid Lagoon.\n\nStormy returns in the episode \"[[Izzy and the Sea-Unicorn]]\", Izzy's new friend [[Cornica]], a magical sea unicorn, disappears, and Jake suggests they ask the mermaids if they knew where to find her. But Queen Coralie and a few of her subjects didn't believe Izzy's tale. However, Stormy was the only one who believed Izzy's story and decided to accompany Jake and his crew to locate Cornica, who has been captured by Captain Hook.\n\nStormy makes a brief appearance in \"[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates: Battle for the Book]]\", [[Peter Pan (character)|Peter Pan]] comes to the mermaids' defense when a vicious sea beast enters Mermaid Lagoon.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n*\"[[The Mermaid's Song]]\" (first appearance)\n*\"[[Treasure of the Tides]]\"\n*\"[[Izzy's Trident Treasure!]]\"\n*\"[[Tricks, Treats and Treasure!]]\"\n*\"[[Cubby's Pet Problem]]\"\n*\"[[Jake's Birthday Bash!]]\"\n*\"[[Captain Who?]]\" (cameo)\n{{Col-2}}\n*\"[[Sandy and the Clams]]\"\n*\"[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates: Never Land Rescue|Jake's Never Land Rescue]]\"\n*\"[[Jake's Royal Rescue]]\"\n*\"[[The Never Sands of Time]]\"\n*\"[[Izzy and the Sea-Unicorn]]\"\n*\"[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates: Battle for the Book|Battle for the Book]]\" (non-speaking cameo)\n{{Col-end}}\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink|Stormy/Gallery}}\n{{Jake and the Neverland Pirates}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Mermaids]]\n[[Category:Jake and the Never Land Pirates characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Hybrids]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]"
