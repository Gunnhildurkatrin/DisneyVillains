Sam brought Ellie along with him to the Amazon rainforest where he did work with the [[Jungle Navigation Company]].  Ellie also sometimes accompanied Sam's cousin and business-affiliate [[Chief Nah-Mee]] in his east-coast operations.\n\n=== Development history ===\nEllie originally only appeared in Disneyland's Jungle Cruise where she stood at the feet of Trader Sam while he tried to sell shrunken heads.  In [[2021]] the attraction was updated to removed racist stereotypes such as was the case with Trader Sam.  Sam's outpost was replaced with, \"Trader Sam's Gift Shop!\" which is to feature Ellie.  It is unknown at time of writing if Ellie is to also be installed in the [[Magic Kingdom]]'s Jungle Cruise for the same scene.\n\n== Disney Parks ==\n\n=== Disneyland ===\n\n==== Jungle Cruise ====\nEllie appears at Trader Sam's outpost, trumpeting and potentially spraying at guests with her trunk.\n\n==== [[Trader Sam's|Trader Sam's Enchanted Tiki Bar]] ====\nA photograph of Ellie is hung in this bar alongside a message from Trader Sam explaining their history.\n\n=== Hong Kong Disneyland ===\n\n==== Jungle River Cruise ====\nEllie appears alone somewhere in Africa after boats exit the Canyon of the Gods and return to the boathouse.\n\n=== Tokyo Disneyland ===\n\n==== Jungle Cruise: Wildlife Expeditions ====\nIn this version of the attraction, Ellie appears with Chief Nah-mee as he tries to sell fruit and jewellery to passing-by boats.\n\n== External links ==\n\n* ''[https://junglecruise.fandom.com/wiki/Ellie Ellie]'' on ''[https://junglecruise.fandom.com/wiki/Jungle_Cruise_Wiki Jungle Cruise Wiki]''.\n{{Jungle Cruise}}\n[[Category:Elephants]]\n[[Category:Jungle Cruise characters]]\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
