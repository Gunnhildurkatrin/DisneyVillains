She was introduced in the Season 1 episode \"[[Downhill]]\" of ''[[Kim Possible]]''.\n==Personality==\nShe is shown to have a very different personality from all her daughters, in that she lacks their abrasive attitudes and seems genuinely gregarious and friendly. Mrs. Rockwaller is also shown to be talkative and slightly over-protective of her Bonnie, and to seemingly be unaware of her daughter's cold attitude toward others. Her marital status is unknown.\n\nMrs. Rockwaller calls Bonnie \"Bon-Bon\" and \"Pumpkin\" as pet names \u2014 much to Bonnie's chagrin, as well as Ron's amusement. Since discovering this, Ron has teasingly called her \"Bon-Bon\" whenever he gets the chance.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\">\nKim_Possible_-_Downhill_part_3_031_0001.jpg|Mrs. Rockwaller embarrassing Bonnie\nMrsRockWaller.thumb.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Eternal Links==\n[//kimpossible.wikia.com/wiki/Mrs._Rockwaller http://kimpossible.wikia.com/wiki/Mrs._Rockwaller]\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Kim Possible}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rockwaller}}\n[[Category:Kim Possible characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
