They somewhat\u00a0serve as [[Mrs. Calloway]]'s conscience and put a guilt-trip on her by staring at her with big eyes.\n\n==Personality==\nOther than their big-eyed stare, the chicks don't show very much emotion. However, they are seen jumping up and down and cheeping happily when [[Pearl Gesner|Pearl]]'s [[Little Patch of Heaven (farm)|farm]] is saved in the end. One of the chicks is able to crow like an adult rooster.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Home on the Range]]''===\nThe chicks are first seen during the \"[[Little Patch of Heaven]]\" music number. They hatch from eggs being laid by [[Audrey (Home on the Range)|Audrey]] and the other hens, but not before [[Mrs. Calloway]] catches them in her hat. A few chicks are then seen playing on Pearl's pitchfork, to which she chuckles with delight. The chicks are later present when [[Maggie]] first arrives on the farm and stare at her with big eyes before she is welcomed by Mrs. Calloway.\n\nWhen the farm animals later learn\u00a0that the bank has threatened to auction off the farm if Pearl cannot come up with $750 within three days, Mrs. Calloway and [[Grace]] get talked into entering themselves with\u00a0Maggie in a show at the [[Chugwater|town]] fair in an attempt to win prize money. Mrs. Calloway is reluctant to do so at first, but gets convinced by the newly-hatched chicks who cheep and stare at her crossly.\n\nAfter some time passes, the farm animals start to worry about the cows. The chicks are seen being auctioned off when it looked like Pearl was going to lose her farm after a disguised [[Alameda Slim]] (whom the cows hoped to capture and use the reward money to save the farm) closed the deal with [[Sheriff Sam Brown]] on buying Little Patch of Heaven.\n\nIn the film's climax, the chicks help the three cows (who have returned from their journey) battle a disguised Alameda Slim after he attempts to kill the bovines by climbing up his pant leg and pecking him. One of them crows loudly in Slim's ear. The chicks and the farm animals succeed in defeating Slim, who is then arrested by the Sheriff. When Pearl happily states that her farm is saved, the chicks jump up and down, cheeping for joy. After Pearl uses the reward money to pay the bank's debt for Little Patch of Heaven, a photographer takes a picture of Pearl and her livestock, with the chicks and everyone else\u00a0smiling save [[Jeb]].\n\nThe chicks are last seen dancing with all the other farm animals (a few dance on Mrs. Calloway's back) as they celebrate Pearl's farm being salvaged and re-opened. One chick crows like a rooster just before the end credits roll.\n\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nclipcow232.gif|The chicks\nClipcows21.gif\npic-7215.jpg\nNormal DisneyEnchantedPDVD 043.jpg\nNormal DisneyEnchantedPDVD 114.jpg\nHome-on-the-range-disneyscreencaps com-1127.jpg\nnormal DisneyEnchantedPDVD 121.jpg\nnormal DisneyEnchantedPDVD 123.jpg\nHome-on-the-range-disneyscreencaps.com-7849.jpg|One chick crows loudly in [[Alameda Slim|Slim]]'s ear.\nPearlandFarmAnimals.jpg\nHome-on-the-range-disneyscreencaps com-8312.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Home on the Range}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Home on the Range characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Infants]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Farm animals]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]"
