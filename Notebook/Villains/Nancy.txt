She is [[Bill Sikes]]' former love interest. She is considered and likes to consider herself like a mother to [[Oliver Twist (character)|Oliver]] at times.\n\n==Role in the film==\nNancy is first seen entering [[Fagin (Oliver Twist)|Fagin]]'s warehouse with her boyfriend, [[Bill Sikes]] and his dog, Bull's Eye to discuss business with Fagin and to get paid for a job he did last Sunday (probably a theft or a murder).\n\nThen, Nancy meets and takes a sudden liking to [[Oliver Twist (character)|Oliver]], an orphaned boy found on the streets by [[Dodger (Oliver Twist)|Dodger]] and taken in by Fagin. Sikes calls for her to attend further business with Fagin. So, Fagin tells his thieving boys to get outside and do their jobs; not before instructing Dodger to keep an eye on Oliver and make sure nothing happens to him.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nBillthreat.png|Bill threatening Nancy\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Oliver Twist characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:English characters]]\n[[Category:Dickensian characters]]"
