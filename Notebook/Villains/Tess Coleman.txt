She has a common widowed mother life, taking care of her children\u00a0[[Anna Coleman|Anna]] and\u00a0[[Harry Coleman|Harry]]\u00a0with no problems, but always involved with discussions, especially with Anna. When she gets a phone call from the school principal that Anna was in detention twice, she punishes her by cutting off her privacy privileges and taking down her bedroom door.\n\nThe top of the discussion comes in Pei Pei's Chinese Restaurant when Anna tells Tess that she has an audition of her band at the same time of Tess' rehearsal dinner, leaving her even angrier about it.\n\nIn Anna's body, Tess realizes that [[Stacey Hinkhouse]] is in fact Anna's friend-turned-enemy as when she tried to mend their friendship, Stacey still harassed her, so she erases all of the answers on Stacey's test, and her music with Anna's band\u00a0is not all that \"noise\". Tess owns a 2001 Volvo S60, which is also driven by Anna, when body-switched.\n\n==Gallery==\n''Coming soon!''\n\n==Trivia==\n* [[Annette Bening]]\u00a0was originally slated to play Tess. She backed out shortly before filming, and was replaced by\u00a0Jamie Lee Curtis.\u00a0[[Sigourney Weaver]]\u00a0was also considered for the role.\n\n{{Freaky Friday}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Coleman, Tess}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Freaky Friday characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]\n[[Category:Authors]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Widows/Widowers]]\n[[Category:Deuteragonists]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
