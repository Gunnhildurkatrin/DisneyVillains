Originally met by Miles and Leo Callisto while the 2 were out on planet Crunkle hunting for junk with M.E.R.C. Hubie was in pieces when the 2 had found him, having been caught in the path of a starsweeper and taken to Crunkle by accident. Originally feeling as if all hope was lost, Hubie went with Miles and M.E.R.C. to hunt for his star map while Leo fixed his ship. They succeeded despite some difficulties, and Hubie left Crunkle safe and sound, giving the Calistos a junk hunt to remember.\n\nAfter returning home, Hubie eventually became a scientist at the Tomorrowland Mission Center, helping to develop new gadgets for the TTA in the center's lab. he retained the position all the way to the formation of the  current Mission Force One lineup, and provided them with the necessary equipment for this mission to Infurnia.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Hubie is the first robot in the series to be completely humanoid in shape.\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Miles from Tomorrowland characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
