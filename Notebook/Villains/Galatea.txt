Inspired by the classic Greek myth of Pygmalion and Galatea, she is a clay statue that was sculpted by [[Hercules (character)|Hercules]] and brought to life by [[Aphrodite]] so she could be Herc's perfect girl and date for the Aphrodesia Dance.\n\n==Role in the [[Hercules (TV series)|series]]==\nIn \"[[Hercules and the Dream Date]]\", when Hercules looks for a date for the Aphrodite Dance, he takes inspiration from the stories of Pygmalion, the aging art teacher of Prometheus Academy that sculpted himself a beautiful wife who absolutely adores him, Hercules sculpts himself a date with mediocre results and asks Aphrodite to bring her to life after improving on her figure. Taking looks as a greater priority over a personality, Hercules only specifies that Galatea is crazy over him. However, things get out of hand as Galatea becomes over-protective of Hercules and paranoid over him talking to any girl other than herself. It escalates to a point where Hercules and Pegasus drop her off on a small island off the coast and dump her.\n\nHowever, absorbing sediment and walking on the seafloor of the Mediterranean, Galatea makes her way back to Athens and crashes the Dance in a more statue-like form, creating various weapons from her hands and using her abilities to merge with the stone in the building. But a fire breaks out and dries Galatea out while Hercules makes a rescue attempt. Aphrodite arrives finding the party in ruin and brings Galatea to life after Hercules learned his lesson and gives her a free will. No longer interested in Hercules, Galatea chooses to date Ajax instead.\n\nAphrodite also comments that not everyone learns the lesson, pointing gesturing to Pygmalion who is quite happy to have such a beautiful wife despite her being as crazy as Galatea was, his wife is indeed the mythological version of Galatea.\n\n==Trivia==\n* During the making of the episode Galatea first starred in, [[Lisa Kudrow]] (Aphrodite) and [[Jennifer Aniston]] (Galatea) were also working together on ''Friends''.\n* In her episode, Galatea was briefly Hercules's girlfriend. Coincidentally, [[Jennifer Aniston]] (Galatea) and [[Tate Donovan]] (Hercules) were dating each other at the time the episode aired, and so were their characters in ''Friends'' briefly.\n* While it is established that this Galatea is just similar to another incident with Pygmalion, in the original Greek mythology both Pygmalion and Galatea were quite happy together to the point that they have a daughter named Paphos. In some versions however, Paphos is their son and their daughter is Metharme.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nGalateaOriginal.JPG|Galatea before having been brought to life and given her makeover by Aphrodite\nGalatea3.jpg|Stony Galatea crashing the Dance\nGalatea4.jpg|Galatea stretching her arms\n1304526579835.jpg|Galatea going for an \"exotic\" gorgon look\nGalatea.PNG\nC31A5BE8-38E7-48C7-BB01-8A85CFEE8878.png\nA0538427-FAF5-491A-804F-892350A58A63.png\nA7AEF20A-ED60-4986-A55A-2A05581008B3.png\n4DF97F70-6EF5-4440-9CC3-BC876E794522.png\n314BACCB-2D7A-481B-88BE-D85F71079073.png\nB2F81F4B-40B2-45A6-9FDD-DD6E2911A754.png\n2EBBA932-B6A6-41A5-8AD5-C61E5AD8C23F.png\n696943F8-2528-4809-B805-7CE6CA6804BA.png\n86D15CB3-2E31-439F-B5AA-81819366C45F.png\nC5C174AD-A7C3-4B4E-B539-B5DE0079FC29.png\n0555EBBD-DF93-412C-8D6D-D3E547742960.png\n0522EAE0-33E2-4402-ADDF-A6CF1671C4CF.png|Okay fine I\u2019ll be my own person\n8060AD28-F6C9-4032-8093-2A57ACDC17AA.png|Galatea after being brought to life\n39612492-918E-4D7C-9963-70439D3450AE.png\n3C9AA084-591B-4104-87FB-581A487CF5E0.png\nCF361B50-62D7-4F3F-99B2-32AC9E373171.png\nHercules and the Dream Date (6).jpg\nHercules and the Dream Date (5).jpg\nHercules and the Dream Date (4).jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Hercules}}\n[[Category:Hercules characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Greek Mythology]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Created by Magic]]\n[[Category:Greek characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Those brought back to life]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
