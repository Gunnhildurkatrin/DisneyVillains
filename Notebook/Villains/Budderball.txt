He enjoys eating and wears black ink on his face to look like a football player. In addition, he also sports a red football shirt. When his paw is pulled, he passes unbearable gas. Because he is best known for being a glutton, this sometimes causes his younger siblings and himself to wind up in trouble. He also got on [[Santa Paws]]' naughty list for eating the family's Thanksgiving turkey, but was eventually taken off. He lives in Fernfield, [[Washington]], with his famous all-star father, [[Air Bud (dog)|Buddy]], and mother, [[Molly (Air Bud)|Molly]]. His owner is Bartleby Livingston, a rich but lonely boy who was seemingly a bully at first, though all he truly wanted was a friend, which is why Budderball decided to stay with him.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Usually, Budderball passes gas when his paw is pulled, but there are times he does it himself.\n**In an outtake of ''[[Snow Buddies]]'', he farts by himself and claims it was a chili cheese dog he had for lunch.\n**In ''[[Spooky Buddies]]'', after Budderball eats pickled eyeballs, [[B-Dawg]] signals him to fart on the [[Halloween Hound]] before he can suck out Budderball's soul.\n**In ''[[Treasure Buddies]]'', he farts by himself after eating dynamite explosives when he mistook them for stinky cheese.\n*He is very similar to [[Tummi Gummi]] from ''[[Adventures of the Gummi Bears|Gummi Bears]]'', [[Broadway]] from ''[[Gargoyles]]'', [[Rolly]] from the ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians|101 Dalmatians]]'' franchise, and [[Circus Bugs|Heimlich]] from ''[[A Bug's Life]]'', as all five love food and have gluttonous appetites.\n*He is also very similar to [[Pumbaa]] from [[The Lion King (franchise)|''The Lion King'' franchise]] in that they both have farting problems.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nBudderball 1600x1200.jpg\nSnow buddies budderball.jpg\nNormal Budderball s.jpg\nBudderball Card.jpg\nair-buddies-disneyscreencaps.com-382.jpg\nSuper Buddies Budderball.jpg\nsnow-buddies-disneyscreencaps.com-9386.jpg\nSnow Buddies Budderball.jpg\nBudderballCamera.jpg\nIMG 3344.PNG\nspookybuddies-disneyscreencaps.com-9378.jpg|Budderball using his flatulence to deflect the Halloween Hound's howl breath back at him.\nspookybuddies-disneyscreencaps.com-9398.jpg\nBudderball Stare.png\nBudderball.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Air Bud}}\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Air Bud characters]]\n[[Category:Superheroes]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]\n[[Category:Characters who pass gas]]"
