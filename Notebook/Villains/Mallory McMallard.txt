Her tough exterior hides a soft side, however. A fiery redhead, and a temper to match. Mallory is well-learned in Puckworld's version of the martial arts, although most of the time she is content with just using a Puck Blaster. She has a sharp tongue and usually directs it towards [[Nosedive Flashblade|Nosedive]]'s immature acts, or anything that she feels is \"out of line.\" \n\nWith her strong military background as a member of the \"Puckworld Special Forces,\" she often thinks in black and white, a strict disciplinarian, and has high regard for the chain of command. She's stubborn, which can be a fault as much as a strength. Her jersey number is 15.\n\n\n==Trivia==\n* Mallory greatly resembles an adult version of [[Gosalyn Mallard]].\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==References==\n<references />\n{{The Mighty Ducks}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:McMallard, Mallory}}\n[[Category:Mighty Ducks (TV show) characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Martial Artists]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Superheroes]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Deuteragonists]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
