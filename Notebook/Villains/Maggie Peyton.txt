When [[Herbie]] sees her and her passion for racing he grew a liking towards, and after many attempts to gain her attention, she buys the little car.\n\nDuring her first drive, she thinks about sending Herbie back because of his unexplained and embarrassing tricks on her, but after he helps her beat the NASCAR champion [[Trip Murphy]] in a road race, she changes her attitude toward him and they become friends.\n\nShe secretly enters Herbie in a drag race posing a masked race driver named Maxx. Unaware to them, the whole thing was set up so Trip could learn about the little car's secrets and get even. When Herbie sees Maggie take a joyride in Trip's NASCAR and say it was the best ride ever, he becomes quite jealous and deliberately loses their final race to Trip. Maggie reluctantly reveals her identity to public, and loses Herbie, who gets taken to a demolition derby.\n\nMaggie manages to save him, and after her brother, Ray Jr., gets hurt during practice, he suggests Maggie should take his place, but Ray Sr. is still against it. However, they proceed to go ahead with it, and fix up Herbie for the race. Together, they take on the toughest tricks that the other drives throw at them and win.\n\nMaggie and her closest friend, [[Kevin (Herbie: Fully Loaded)|Kevin]], later become a couple and share their first kiss.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\">\nMaggie Peyton 1.jpg\nThe keys to Herbie.jpg\nHerbiefl-09.jpg\nMaggie Peyton 2.jpg\nMaggie Peyton 3.jpg|So embarrassed\nHerbiefl-10.jpg\nMaggie Peyton 4.jpg|Maggie with Herbie\nHerbie-fully-loaded-disneyscreencaps.com-3614.jpg\nHerbie 8.jpg\nHerbieFL Trip talks to Maggie.jpg\nHerbiefl-12.jpg\nRebuilding Herbie.jpg|Herbie's restoration\nMaggie Peyton 6.jpg\nDragrace Hebie.jpg\nHerbie Fully Loaded 1.jpg\nHerbiefl-14.jpg|NASCAR Nextel Cup final race\nHerbiefl-13.jpg\nNASCAR herbie.jpg|Herbie and Maggie's victory\nMaggie Peyton 5.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Love Bug}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Peyton, Maggie}}\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:The Love Bug characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]"
