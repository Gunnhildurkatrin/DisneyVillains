The club is introduced in the novel ''[[Return to the Isle of the Lost: A Descendants Novel|Return to the Isle of the Lost]]''.\n\n==Background==\nAfter [[Mal]] defeated her mother Maleficent during the [[Auradon]] coronation, the [[Isle of the Lost]] was left leaderless. Many children on the Isle found themselves acting kindly to others, and after seeing the events of the coronation, decided that evil wasn't the right path for them. Yen Sid founded the Anti-Heroes Club for these like-minded individuals to meet and learn goodness. The members of the group look up to [[Mal]], [[Jay (Descendants)|Jay]], [[Evie]] and [[Carlos De Vil|Carlos]] as they were the first to break away from evil and choose to be good.\n\nThe club name is a cover for tricking villains, although the name carries a double meaning. As Yen Sid explains, an anti-hero works for good, but uses tactics and resources normally used by villains to do the job, mirroring the club's motivations towards the path of good despite their heritage.\n\n[[Dr. Facilier]] discovered the club's true nature and disbanded it.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Mad Maddy was part of the club, but was not actually considering turning good as she was just as wicked as her grandmother [[Madam Mim]]; she only joined so she could get back at Mal, and was actually a spy for the villains.\n*[[Yen Sid]] has been teaching the members proper manners, noting that the slovenliness taught on the island is a hard habit to break.\n*The Anti-Heroes will be getting their chance to move to Auradon, thanks to Evie, who provided [[Ben (Descendants)|King Ben]] with a list of who was part of the club.\n\n{{Descendants}}\n[[Category:Descendants]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Descendants characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Article stubs]]"
