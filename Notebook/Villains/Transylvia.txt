She is reminiscent of the winged monkeys from ''The Wizard of Oz'' or the ''Tengu'' from Japanese mythology. She travels on a flying \"boomerangstick\", and is proud of the fact that people are scared of her, but seems to have self-confidence issues (until the end of the episode) and turned out to not be so scary once the gang got to know her (although she dissuaded them from telling anyone).\n\n==Gallery==\n\n<gallery>\nIMG_1423.PNG\nIMG_1449.PNG|Another failed attempt\nIMG_1462.PNG\nIMG_1470.PNG|Scared of a Gorantula\nIMG_1511.PNG\nIMG_1427.PNG\nIMG_1446.PNG\nIMG_1477.PNG\nIMG_1497.PNG|Transylvia with [[Butterbear]]\nIMG_1508.PNG\nIMG_1432.PNG\nIMG_1420.PNG\ngroup42.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}{{Wuzzles}}\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Vultures]]\n[[Category:Apes]]\n[[Category:Wuzzles characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Witches]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Hybrids]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
