One day, Honestus searched for his own truth in return to Mervana, but never returned. As the kingdom fell, Honestus transformed into a monstrous fish generations ago as punishment for not seeking inner truth.\n\n==Role in the series==\nHonestus was featured in the Season 3 episode, \"[[The Lost Harp of Mervana!]]\".\n\nHonestus appears physically in his monstrous fish form preparing to eat Webby and Louie just as he chases the two across the dark chamber. [[Bentina Beakley|Mrs. Beakley]] saves them from Honestus, causing him to retreat. Just as the three arrive at the top of the temple, they hear the [[Harp of Troy|Harp of Mervana]] explaining the truth that Honestus failed to seek inner truth. Asking her, she tells her the about real truth which recaps the truth that Honestus had to work on land and sea to grow the kingdom of the merpeople. However, he ignored what the harp said and caused his kingdom to be in trouble while seeking his own truth and years ago, Honestus was transformed into a monstrous fish as punishment for not helping the kingdom. It is then revealed the sea monster Webby, Louie, and Mrs. Beakley fought was actually Honestus himself just as the three plan to bring the harp to prove the merpeople the truth about Honestus.\n\nBack to [[Scrooge McDuck]], Huey and Dewey, Louie warns that Honestus is arriving just he starts terrorizing the Mervanans while Dewey tells Donald to repel him. The citizens of Mervana fight against a corrupted King Honestus. The McDucks (this time with [[Della Duck|Della]] joining in) and the rest of the Mervanans escape from the ancient tower where Louie, Webby, and Mrs. Beakley found the Harp. The rest of the Mervanans lose their tails and have their feet revealed, alongside King Honestus who reverts to his normal form. Afterwards, the Harp warns him the only way to rebuild his kingdom is to put in hard work and effort as punishment just as [[Aletheia]], [[Vero]], and the rest of the Mervanans plan to conquer their fear of land and adapt to a new life from sea and land to rebuild the fallen kingdom by working together to rebuild it just as the McDucks leave Mervana.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Honestus has a striking resemblance to the Greek god Poseidon.\n\n{{DuckTales}}\n[[Category:Mermen]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:DuckTales characters]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Sea Monsters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
