"{{Infobox character\n|name = Karen the Park Guide\n|image = Karen the Park Guide.png\n|games = ''[[Kinect: Disneyland Adventures]]''\n|voice = Kelly Donohue\n|occupation = Cast Member at Disneyland\n|inspiration = VIP Tour Guide}}\n'''Karen''' is a VIP tour guide at [[Disneyland]]. She appears in ''[[Kinect: Disneyland Adventures]]''.\n\n==Background information==\nAccording to a video interview, the Karen in the game is based on the VIP tour guide that showed developers around the park, providing them with facts as they went around. The developers were so grateful that they asked her to be apart of the game. Apparently \"signing her rights\" away,\u00a0Karen can be found in all around Disneyland, providing players with tidbits of Disneyland history and facts. Unlike the other meet-and-greet characters, she cannot be hugged, high-fived, danced with, sign autographs, or have pictures\u00a0taken, unlike the real-life Karen.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Disney Interactive Studios characters]]\n[[Category:Kinect Disneyland Adventures characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in video games]]"
