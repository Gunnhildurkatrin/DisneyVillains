He is a Swiss scientist who becomes obsessively convinced that he can bring the dead back to life, or rather, create life through means of chemistry and biology. Through ambiguous means, he assembles a body composed of previously deceased men (implied to have been criminals) and succeeds in creating life, but becomes horrified by his creation and turns it away.\n\nVictor soon becomes remorseful after the Creature, referred to as \"The Daemon\" throughout the novel, begins killing those closest to him. He forces Victor to create a bride, but when he refuses, the Creature kills his fiance Elizabeth. Victor chases him to the North Pole where he is found by an explorer whom he relates his tale to. Victor dies and the Creature, saddened by his death takes his body deep into the winter wasteland.\n\nAlong with his monster companion, as well as other literary scares such as [[Dracula]], Dr. Frankenstein has become an icon and has been portrayed by numerous actors. The famous 1931 film adaptation, directed by James Whale, starred Colin Clive as the doctor and gave him a hunchbacked assistant named Fritz (commonly mistaken as Igor) while the 1957 film by Terrence Fisher starred [[Peter Cushing]] in a more sinister depiction.\n\n== Description ==\nVictor Frankenstein is a clever and industrious 11-year old boy who is inspired by science. He lives with his parents and dog, [[Sparky (Frankenweenie) |Sparky]], in the town of New Holland. Victor immerses himself in making films and inventing in his attic workshop. When Sparky dies in a car accident, Victor uses scientific ingenuity to bring him back to life.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Frankenweenie]]''===\nVictor is shy, introverted, brilliantly creative, and exceptionally intelligent. He spends most of his time with his dog or up in the attic where he works on his science experiments. In the ending, he shows a heroic side that is not shown at first due to his shyness, and the apparent need to work alone.\n\nVictor appears to harbor a crush on his neighbor, Elsa Van Helsing, a somber yet soulful girl whose uncle is the mayor of New Holland; although confirmation is never cleared. Their dogs Sparky and [[Persephone (Frankenweenie)|Persephone]], however, are another story entirely.\n\n===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===\nVictor appears on ''Once Upon a Time'', played by David Anders. Dr. Victor Frankenstein is a scientist who believes magic to be inferior to science. He is the older brother of Gerhardt and the son of Alphonse.\n\nIn the Land Without Color, Victor originally seeks a way to restore life to the dead but has his funding pulled by his father. [[Rumplestiltskin]] offers him gold in exchange for the scientific method on how to revive the dead as magic could not. Victor robs a grave for body parts to experiment on but is caught by Gerhardt who is shot by a police officer. As Victor attempts to bring Gerhardt back to life, electricity cannot revive him, so Rumplestiltskin instead offers a heart from the [[Enchanted Forest]]. As part of a bargain, he creates a false attempt to reanimate Daniel to make it easier for Rumplestiltskin to manipulate her. In his own world, Frankenstein reanimates his brother with the heart, thus creating [[Frankenstein's Monster]], who beats Alphonse to death. Victor imprisons the Monster until he can devise a way to help the Monster overcome his psychotic rage. When the [[The Evil Queen|Evil Queen]] cast her curse, Victor is sent to the Land Without Magic.\n\nIn [[Storybrooke]], he is Dr. Whale, a doctor working in Storybrooke General Hospital. He originally assists Regina Mills, doing whatever she says without hesitation. After the curse is broken, he leads a mob to Regina's home intending to kill her. Victor later seeks a way to return to his brother, believing if he were to do something for Regina she would bring him back. He successfully reanimates Daniel's corpse with a magical heart, turning him into a monster who savagely rips off Whale's arm. Mr. Gold later reattaches his arm. He is transported back to the Land Without Color when Regina undid her curse.\n\nAfter [[Snow White]] cast a new curse, somehow, Victor returns to Storybrooke, resuming his position as the doctor at the hospital. He also helps deliver [[Snow White|Mary Margaret]]'s and later [[Theodora the Wicked Witch of the West|Zelena]]'s baby. He later helps [[Dr. Jekyll]] with his experiments to create a new serum to defeat the [[Evil Regina|Evil Queen]].\n\n==Trivia==\n*Victor is based on Mary Shelley's Doctor Victor Frankenstein, the creator of the monster from the novel ''Frankenstein''.\n*Victor Frankenstein looks like a child version of Victor Van Dort from Tim Burton's [[2005]] film ''[[wikipedia:Corpse Bride|Corpse Bride]]''. On a related note, both characters had and lost their dog at a young age. However, both characters had their dog returned back to them from the dead.\n*In ''Once Upon a Time'', Frankstenstein goes by the name \"Dr. Whale\", in Storybrooke. This is a reference to director [[Wikipedia:James Whale|James Whale]], who directed ''Frankenstein'' (1931) and ''Bride of Frankenstein'' (1935).\n\n==Gallery==\n===''[[Frankenweenie]]''===\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\">\nFrankenweenie-DVD-Review-3.jpg|Victor and his family with Sparky.\nVictor and Sparky Frankenstein.png|Best friends for life.\nVictor and Sparky Watching a Movie.jpg|Victor and Sparky are watching \"Captain Sparky vs. the Flying Saucers\".\nVictor Frankenstein.png|Clipart of Victor Frankenstein.\nFrankenweenie - Victor Frankenstein.jpeg\nThe Frankenstein Family Watching a Movie.jpg|Family movie night.\nCp fwb frankenweenie 20130912.jpg\nTumblr n4klewHaik1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\nFrankenweenie-disneyscreencaps.com-8516.jpg\nFrankenweenie-disneyscreencaps.com-5821.jpg\nFrankenweenie01.jpg\nFRANK 09 12 12 Sparky'sReturn.Holly.jpg\nFrankenweenie-1984-01-g.jpg\nFrankenweenie-1984-211594.jpg\nFrankenweenie-1984-tou-01-g.jpg\nFrankenweenie-2to1.jpg\nFrankenweenie-1.jpg\nTumblr mwzxbqF6F11r1incio1 500.jpg\nFrankenweenie-disneyscreencaps.com-444.jpg\nFrankenweenie-disneyscreencaps.com-1207.jpg\nFrankenweenie-disneyscreencaps.com-1325.jpg\nFrankenweenie-disneyscreencaps.com-9194.jpg|Victor heartbroken\nFrankenweenie-disneyscreencaps.com-1790.jpg|NNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!\nFrankenweenie-disneyscreencaps.com-9132.jpg|Victor helpless\nFrankenweenie-disneyscreencaps.com-9128.jpg\nFrankenweenie-disneyscreencaps.com-5492.jpg|Victor howling\n</gallery>\n\n===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\">\nOnce Upon a Time - 1x03 - Snow Falls - Photography - Dr. Whale.jpg\n642706 original.jpg|Frankenstein in ''Once Upon a Time''\nBrotherinthename.jpg\nOnce Upon a Time - 2x05 - The Doctor - Dr. Frankenstein and Jefferson.jpg\nOnce Upon a Time - 2x05 - The Doctor - Dr. Frankenstein with Heart.jpg\nOnce Upon a Time - 2x05 - The Doctor - Frankenstein.png\nOnce Upon a Time - 2x02 - We Are Both - David's Speech.jpg\n212Whale2.PNG\nWhales Harir Dye.jpg\nOnce Upon a Time - 6x03 - The Other Shoe - Jekyll and Whale.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*[[w:c:frankenweenie:Victor Frankenstein|Victor Frankenstein]] on the [[w:c:frankenweenie:Frankenweenie_Wiki|Frankenweenie Wiki]]\n*{{OUAT|Victor Frankenstein}}\n\n{{Frankenweenie}}\n{{Once Upon a Time}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Frankenstein, Victor}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Frankenweenie characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Once Upon a Time characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:German characters]]\n[[Category:European characters]]"
