He openly voices his opinion on things, mostly food, and openly belittles those he feels do not meet his standards. Despite this, he does have a sense of individuality as he does not like being pampered to or given special treatment and wants to be seen as a normal person like everyone else. He is also shown to be very sociable with people as he often hosts various events such as the Firefly Festival (\"[[Dating Season]]\") and the mayoral run (\"[[Hop-Popular]]\").\n\n===Physical appearance===\nAlbus is a light green newt with a pale green underbelly and four fingered hands. He has a long tail that has darker green spots on it. He has big round pale blue eyes with violet pupils and turquoise hair that is slightly long and tied into a ponytail with a purple ribbon.\n\nHe wears black pants, a navy blue undershirt and a purple waistcoat. He wears a pair of matching purple dress shoes and a black hat.\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*Albus uses a message board in Amphibia which is a literal message board due to the fact that computers do not exist, that is until the episode \"[[Fort in the Road]]\".\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nHop-Popular 3.png\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n\n*[[w:c:amphibiapedia:Albus Duckweed|Albus Duckweed]] at the [[w:c:amphibiapedia:Main Page|Amphibia Wiki]]\n\n{{Amphibia}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Duckweed, Albus}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Amphibia characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Urodela]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
