"\n[[File:Cheerleaders.png|thumb]]\n'''The Cheerleaders''' are a group of cheerleaders at [[Freshwater High]]. They serve as recurring background characters, and they have a notable crush on [[Steve Jackson]].\n\n==Personal life==\nThey first appear holding the \"Fighting Fish Hooks\" mascot for [[Coach Salmons]] to announce the football players. When the football team was playing their big game at the Gecko tank, they were cheering for them, but dehydrated because of no water. They then cheer for [[Milo the Fish|Milo]] when he was saving the game as Water Boy (\"[[Underwater Boy]]\"). The Cheerleaders, like most other people, liked [[Randy Pincherson|Randy]]'s fridge hats better than Milo's. When Milo, [[Bea Goldfishberg|Bea]] and [[Oscar the Fish|Oscar]] got revenge on Randy, Winnie caused all of her hair to come off with it (\"[[Milo's Big Idea]]\"). Most of the cheerleaders were taken away from the tank, except [[Clamantha]], so [[Koi]], Bea, Milo, Oscar, [[Esmargot]], and [[Finberley]] joined to participate in the Cheer Off. However, the cheerleaders appear in the series in future episodes, meaning they probably didn't get adopted or taken from the tanks (\"[[We've Got Fish Spirit]]\"). Winnie was talking to [[Bo Gregory]] when Oscar took out her hairband to imitate the Queen of Fish England (\"[[Oscar Makes an Impression]]\"). Winnie also took Clamantha's side when Clamantha and [[Shellsea]] divided into teams on who should apologize (\"[[Fish Talent Show]]\").\n\n==Background information==\n*The cheerleader with purple hair was seen getting painted on by Shellsea in \"Legend of the Earth Troll\".\n*The most commonly seen of the cheerleaders is [[Winnie Grouper]]. She has had four speaking roles in Season 1 and one speaking role in Season 2, while the other cheerleaders only spoke in the background in \"Underwater Boy\". She is a cute, bubbly and ditzy girl.\n*The cheerleaders were taken away from the tanks by Bud in \"We've Got Fish Spirit\", although they appear in future episodes.\n*One of the cheerleaders is Finberley's sister. As revealed in Noah Z. Jones' Facebook, it is unknown to be found.\n*The cheerleaders were in the Freshwater Prom where they make cameo appearances throughout the prom.\n*It is revealed that Tabitha has a craving for snacks.\n*The pink haired fish, who is Finberley's sister, might be named Gillica, a portmanteau of \"Gill\" and \"Jessica\".\n\n==Appearances==\n*\"[[Underwater Boy]]\" (First appearance)\n*\"[[Queen Bea]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Milo Gets a Ninja]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Dollars and Fish]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Legend of the Earth Troll]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Parasite Fright]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Milo's Big Idea]]\"\n*\"[[Diary of a Lost Fish]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[We've Got Fish Spirit]]\"\n*\"[[Oscar Makes an Impression]]\"\n*\"[[Fish School Musical]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Employee Discount]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Fish Talent Show]]\"\n*\"[[Hairanoid]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Adventures in Fish-Sitting]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Merry Fishmas, Milo]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Milo on the Lam]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Break Up Shake Down]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n\n{{Fish Hooks}}\n[[Category:Fish Hooks characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Cheerleaders]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Fish]]\n[[Category:Marine Animals]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
