Thaddeus Toad]] when he was accused of having stolen a motorcar.  Determined to have Toad locked up, the prosecutor called upon [[Angus MacBadger]], [[Mole]] and [[Ratty]] to testify only to partially hear them out and frequently cut them off.\n\nInnocent, Toad would call upon his witness of [[Cyril Proudbottom]] to explain that he had traded [[Toad Hall]] for the motorcar with a group of [[Weasels]], not knowing it was stolen.  To prove this claim, Toad called on the witness to the trade in one [[Winkie|Mr. Winkie]], not knowing he was the leader of the weasels.  Winkie lied in court against Toad and this resulted in the judge having Toad locked up.\n\n==Disney Parks==\n===''[[Mr. Toad's Wild Ride]]''===\nThe prosecutor notably appears twice in this attraction.  He first appears in the courthouse, under the occupation of a judge.  As guests drive through in their motor-cars he declares them guilty of criminal-offence and immediately has them arrested only for them to make a get-away.  Later in the attraction the guests are run over by a train and find themselves in Hell where a demonic version of the prosecutor deems them as being able to return to the living world.\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:The Prosecutor}}\n{{The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad}}\n[[Category:The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad characters]]\n[[Category:Lawyers]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Judges]]\n[[Category:Demons]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Epic Mickey characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]"
