In \"Return of the Tracker\" he called her every two minutes to make sure she was safe at a movie premiere. In \"Walk this Way\" he fell under the spell of the Horn of Hypnos. Chen also came to Parents' Night and helped ward off angry customers at the Silver Dragon in \"D is for Dangerous\". He got very nervous at Hay Lin's art contest and was also worried about where Yan Lin had disappeared to. He, like the rest of Hay Lin's family, is of Chinese origin.\n\n==Relatives==\n*[[Yan Lin]] (mother)\n*[[Joan Lin]] (wife)\n*[[Hay Lin]] (daughter)\n*[[Chou Khan]] (father-in-law)\n*Mrs. Khan (mother-in-law)\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nParent's Night (27).jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{W.I.T.C.H}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lin, Chen}}\n[[Category:W.I.T.C.H. characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Chinese characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]"
