She is the cat of [[Alice]] and [[Alice's Sister|her sister]].\n\n==Appeareances==\n===''[[Alice in Wonderland]]''===\nIn the film, Dinah is [[Alice]]'s cat. She is first seen sitting with Alice in a tree and listening to [[Alice's Sister|Alice's sister]] read from a history book. Alice then makes a crown out of flowers and puts them on Dinah's head, crowning her the flower girl cat. Then Alice's sister tells Alice to pay attention to her history lesson. Alice refuses to because the book has no pictures in it and tells her sister that in her world there would be books with nothing but pictures in it. Her sister believes this is nonsense. When Alice hears this, she picks up Dinah and tells her that in her world everything would be nonsense, because everything would be what it isn't. For example, animals would talk and live in houses because Alice's World would be a \"Wonderland.\" Suddenly, Dinah and Alice spot a [[White Rabbit]] with a coat on and a pocket watch and they chase after him to the Rabbit Hole. Alice falls down into it and waves goodbye to Dinah as she falls. \n\nDinah is later mentioned by Alice at the Tea Party with the [[Mad Hatter]], the [[March Hare]], and [[The Dormouse]] which frightens him when he hears that Dinah is a cat causing a large fuss over it.\n\nDinah is finally seen at the end when Alice awakens from her dream where she sleeps on her apron (she was also seen sleeping on her before she wakes up). Alice picks her up and takes her home for tea along with Alice's sister.\n\n==Trivia==\n*A test cell setup of Alice, Dinah, and Alice's sister from the final scene of the film shows that Dinah was black instead of orange. Also, in a Big Golden Book by Al Dempster, the colored image of Dinah shows her as a black cat. Early designs for Dinah were lifted directly from a [[Figaro]] model sheet.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Promotional images===\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nAlice French poster1.jpg\n4701219477.jpg\n1951 swedish 2-panel blog.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Stock art===\n<gallery position=\"center\" bordercolor=\"transparent\">\nAlice dinah.gif\nSept231.gif\nClipalicesleep.gif\nClipalicedinah.gif\nClipalicedinah2.gif\nClipalicelaying.gif\ndinahlarge.gif\njune251.gif\nclipdinah.gif\n</gallery>\n\n===Concept art===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nColor glos a-366 640.jpg\nColor glos a-215 640.jpg\nLicensee still - 750-76 640.jpg\nAliceDinaMB.jpg|Alice with Dinah, by Mary Blair.\nAliceDinahDH.jpg|Alice and Dinah by David Hall.\nEnglish valentine birthday card - dinah - inside blog.jpg\nEric larson dinah drawing blog.jpg\n16-field drawing - alice and sister layout drawing blog.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nDiflo.jpg|Dinah with a crown of dasies on her head\nAliceWonderland01.jpg|[[Alice]] and Dinah\n1951-alice-2.jpg\nAlice-in-wonderland-bluray2.jpg\nDina7.jpg\nDina8.jpg\nTumblr ns4nd5Vcme1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\n16-field drawing - alice gazes into the stream screencap.jpg\nDinah by Alice.png\nDina9.jpg|Dinah seeing a reflection of the White Rabbit\nDina10.jpg|Dinah watching Alice fall down the rabbit hole to Wonderland\nTumblr ly2gpnQwVh1r3jmn6o1 1280.png\nTumblr mtyhfrXmTf1sw29l9o2 1280.jpg\nTumblr mtyhfrXmTf1sw29l9o4 1280.jpg|Dinah waving goodbye to Alice as she falls into the pit\n16-field drawing - alice and sister layout screencap.jpg\nAlice-in-wonderland-disneyscreencaps.com-8635.jpg\nTumblr lybkiqr4MV1r3jmn6o1 1280.png\n</gallery>\n\n===Printed media===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nDinah from fc331 like goebel dis 084 640.jpg\nIl fullxfull.442098725 89x2.jpg\nDinah from fc331 like goebel dis 85 640.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Miscellaneous and Merchandise===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nDinah comparison.jpg\nWylers puzzle 13 reference 640.jpg\nGerman bluchert verlag book variant 2 640.jpg\nGerman bluchert verlag book pg 7 640.jpg\nEnglish valentine birthday card - dinah - front blog.jpg\nVira 5x-412-wd front 640.jpg\nDis 084 640.jpg\nAlice Pin.jpg\nAlice and Dinah.png|Dinah playing with Alice\nDinah vinylmation.jpg|Dinah [[Vinylmation]]\nAlice031.jpg\n4f03f8d379789 237892b.jpg\nQuaderno1640.jpg\nRca alice and the white rabbit 45 front 640.jpg\nDinahPlush KMC.jpg|A plushie of Dinah from Disney's Kiss Me!
