He wears a\u00a0blue screen with red, pink, and yellow polka dots, blue eyes, and thin red lips.\n\n==Appearances==\n[[File:Imagemmch.jpg|thumb|153x153px|Toodles before he got a face|left]]\n\nToodles is a super computer that is always there to help Mickey and the gang find the answers they need. He is always shown to come when Mickey and / or one or all of his friends call \"Oh Toodles!\". In seasons 1-2 and most season 3 episodes, he is just a helper with no face and no voice\u00a0approaching Mickey and his friends when they call him. However, in later episodes, he is portrayed as a good friend to them.\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*He speaks with a stutter.\n*He first appeared with his face in \"[[Happy Birthday Toodles]]\". He also gains his voice in the same episode.\n*Before becoming the super computer for the Mouskedoer, he used to be an alarm clock.\n*A Toodles-styled alarm clock made an appearance in the episode \"[[Where's Mickey?]]\" and the \"Mickey Mornings\" short series. This is a reference to Toodles originally being an alarm clock.\n*Toodles and Quoodles have a huge mutual crush on each other.\n*In \"[[Mickey's Mousekedoer Adventure]]\", it is revealed that Toodles' power stems off from the Mousekedoer. Meaning, if the Mousekedoer malfunctions or stops working, then Toodles does too.\n*In [[Mickey's Message from Mars]], Mickey and his friends called him for a Mouseketool by saying \"Toodles, oh!\" instead of the usual \"Oh, Toodles!\" when needing something to cross the sea of sticky sand.\n*Toodles appears to have the ability to camouflage in \"[[Goofy on Mars]].\"\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink|Toodles}}\n{{Mickey Mouse Clubhouse}}\n<gallery>\n</gallery>\n[[pt-br:Toodles]]\n[[ru:\u041f\u043e\u0434\u0440\u0443\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439]]\n[[es:Toodles]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Machines]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse Clubhouse characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Playhouse Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]"
