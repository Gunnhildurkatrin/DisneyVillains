He is one of the protagonists of the ''Wizard of Oz'' book series and movies as well as a friend of [[Dorothy Gale]].\n\n==Appearances in ''Oz'' media==\n===''[[Return to Oz]]''===\n[[File:Cowardly Lion Return to Oz.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Lion in ''Return to Oz''.]]\nAfter Dorothy left Oz and returned home to Kansas, the Cowardly Lion had been turned into a stone statue by the [[Nome King]], but thankfully Dorothy defeats the Nome King and restores the Cowardly Lion to his regular form. Among many other Ozians, he celebrates Dorothy's victory and witnesses the return of Oz's true ruler [[Princess Ozma|Ozma]]. He also says goodbye to Dorothy as she hugs him when she departs, knowing she will return to Oz another time.\n\n===''[[Oz the Great and Powerful]]''===\nThe Cowardly Lion appears in the prequel as a cameo, attacking [[Oscar Diggs|Oscar]] and [[Theodora the Wicked Witch of the West|Theodora]] as he was hunting [[Finley]] when he is trapped in weeds. Oz saves him by performing \"magic\" (a puff of red smoke) in the animal's face. He becomes scared and runs away. In this version, the Lion does not speak, but he does keep his personality. His existence is alluded to when Oscar calls him a coward as he fled.\n\n==Appearances in Disney media==\n===''[[The Muppets' Wizard of Oz]]''===\n[[File:Ta-da.jpg|thumb|250px]]\nIn ''The Muppets' Wizard of Oz'', the Cowardly Lion is portrayed by [[Fozzie Bear]].

He consistently states that he does not want anything. In the end, Phineas and Ferb give him a sandwich.\n\n===''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]''===\nIn the episode \"[[The Wizard of Dizz]]\", the Cowardly Lion is portrayed by [[Donald Duck]].\n\n===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===\nThe Cowardly Lion appears in the Season 6 episode \"[[Where Bluebirds Fly]]\".\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nReturn to Oz - Cowardly Lion.jpg|The Lion turned to stone\nLion with Dorothy.png|The Lion saying goodbye to Dorothy\nDonald lion.jpg|[[Donald Duck|Donald]] as the Cowardly Lion\nOnce Upon a Time - 6x18 - Where Bluebirds Fly - Cowardly Lion 2.jpg|Cowardly Lion in ''Once Upon a Time''\n</gallery>\n\n{{Oz}}\n{{Once Upon a Time}}\n[[Category:Lions]]\n[[Category:Those brought back to life]]\n[[Category:Oz the Great and Powerful characters]]\n[[Category:Oz characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Return to Oz characters]]\n[[Category:The Muppets' Wizard of Oz characters]]\n[[Category:Once Upon a Time characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse Clubhouse characters]]\n[[Category:Phineas and Ferb characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]"
