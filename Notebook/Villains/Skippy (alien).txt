The creature's charred and disoriented appearance after being teleported a short distance across the room suggests the technology is flawed. While teleporting Skippy back across the room, [[S.I.R.]] pauses the process, demonstrating how the technology can be used to suspend subjects in teleportation indefinitely.\n\n===[[Stitch's Great Escape!]]===\nMuch like its predecessor, ''Stitch's Great Escape!'' includes a demonstration of the transport system, with another comical appearance of Skippy. In this ride, the mangled Skippy is repurposed as a new character known only as the \"doughnut guy\", who is portrayed as being a slob and enemy of the United Galactic Federation. This allows both versions of the previous Skippy to appear at the same time.\n\n==Video games==\nSkippy makes a cameo in the mobile game ''[[Disney Magic Kingdoms]]'', appearing as part of the game's representation of Stitch's Great Escape!. He appears in silhouette form in a yellow clouded teleportation tube on either side of the attraction's entrance, popping in and out every few seconds.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nWdw skippy.jpg|Behind the scenes image of Skippy\nSkippy-vinylmation.jpg|Skippy [[Vinylmation]]\nSkippy (Stitch's Great Escape).png|Skippy in ''Disney Magic Kingdoms''\n</gallery>\n\n{{Magic Kingdom}}\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter]]"
