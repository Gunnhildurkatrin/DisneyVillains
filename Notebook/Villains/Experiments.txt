These fictional experiments, also referred to as '''Stitch's cousins''', are genetically engineered creatures created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Dr. Jumba Jookiba]] in [[Jumba's Lab|his lab]] at \"Galaxy Defense Industries\", with the assistance of [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|Dr. Jacques von H\u00e4msterviel]] who funded the projects with \"shady\" business deals. Prior to the events of ''[[Lilo & Stitch]]'', every experiment created was dehydrated into a small orb called an \"[[Experiment Pods|experiment pod]]\" and stored in a special [[Experiment Pod Container|container]] for transport. In ''[[Stitch! The Movie]]'', the container was accidentally opened and the pods rained down on the island of Kauai. The experiments within the pods are reactivated upon contact in water, a point of concern because many of the experiments are dangerous and Kauai hosts one of the wettest spots on Earth.\n\nUpon encountering each experiment, [[Stitch]]'s human friend and partner [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] gives the experiment a name just as she gave Stitch his name. The two then attempt to rehabilitate the experiments and find a purpose for them on Earth that suits their specific abilities, referred to as the \"one true place\" they belong.\n\nStitch, inspired by [[Hawaii]]'s terminology, refers to the other experiments as his \"cousins\" and considers them all a part of his ''\u02bbohana'', or \"extended family\". All of Jumba's original 626 experiments have their names and numbers listed alongside the credits in ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''.\n\n==Background==\n===Biology===\nDue to different experiments' original purposes, the majority of experiments each have a unique appearance, powers, and weaknesses. Though all experiments have unique capabilities and functions, most of them have some abilities in common due to Jumba reusing DNA from one experiment as a prototype for a different experiment, like the similarities of body shape, appearance, and even for powers like in the case of Jumba reusing some of Twang (021)'s DNA in the creation of [[Bragg]] (145), granting the latter musical ability. Most seem capable of scaling walls like a gecko (as Stitch frequently does); many are able to grow and retract an extra pair of arms. Since they are genetic experiments each created with multiple kinds of DNA that Jumba sampled throughout the galaxy, they all age quite differently than creatures on Earth as seen with Lilo and the rest of humanity when time is lapsed 20 years in \"[[Skip (episode)|Skip]]\".\n\nIt is also shown that some experiments' powers (such as [[Mr. Stenchy]] (254)'s cuteness, and [[Checkers]] (029)'s hypnotic effect) do not affect other experiments, possibly so that these powers do not prevent other experiments from carrying out their primary functions. If affected by other experiments' powers, it might be temporary as Stitch managed to recover from [[Drowsy]] (360)'s sleep-inducing program without being exposed to water. Though [[Angel]] (624) primarily reverts other experiments (before her time) to evil, [[Amnesio]] (303) and [[Retro]] (210) can do so as well.\n\nIt is also shown that when an experiment is dehydrated, they will deactivate and turn into a small orb called an experiment pod. If an experiment pod gets wet, the experiment will be reactivated and released. According to Jumba, a home food dehydrator is the only known method of deactivating an experiment a second time.\n\nIt has been shown on numerous occasions that most, if not all, of the experiments have an intentional imperfection added to their design by Jumba, a \"fail-safe\" of sorts. These imperfections were presumably added in by Jumba in the event his experiments ran out of control, in order to provide him with a way of stopping them in their tracks. Even his most powerful experiments like 627 and Leroy, both had their own intentional imperfection, with an over-reactive sense of humor, and the song Aloha Oe, being their respective imperfections.\n\n===Creation===\nUpon each experiment's creation, it is important that their molecules be charged. If an experiment's molecules are not fully charged, about a year after their creation, they will suffer glitches, during which they will experience seizures and temporarily revert to their original programming. If the molecular charging process is not completed, these glitches will eventually burn out the experiment's circuits and kill them.\n\n===Experiment series===\nThe first digit of the experiment numbers reflect what series of experiment they belong to. The official series of experiments, as stated by Jess Winfield, one of the executive producers, are as follows:\n*'''0-Series:''' Jumba's test batch, including many household helpers.\n*'''1-Series:''' Civic disturbances.\n*'''2-Series:''' Technological and scientific.\n*'''3-Series:''' Psychological.\n*'''4-Series:''' Military.\n*'''5-Series:''' Elemental manipulators.\n*'''6-Series:''' Battlefield or doomsday experiments with galactic implications and world-ending properties, Jumba's strongest line.\n\nFor the most part, the colors of the experiment pods correspond to the series numbers; however, some of the pods are colored incorrectly.\n\n==List of experiments==\n===0-Series: Jumba's test batch, including many household helpers===\n<!-- Please do not add speculative descriptions of the experiments based upon their name. This is not fact. If you have verifiable information on what the experiment does, then add it and state your source. -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Num'''\n|'''Pod Color'''\n|'''Nickname'''\n|'''Image'''\n|'''Short Description'''\n|'''Appearance'''\n|-\n|000\n|\n|[[Cyber]]\n|[[File:000 - Cyber.png|300 px]]\n|A purple version of Stitch with the same abilities, but he turns into a black, cyborg experiment, part machine, part alien. His alien form resembles a cross between some sort of lizard, and a koala (and robot) with a bat-like face. He has two cyborg arms, three spider-like legs, and half-helmet (right half of his face is metal) with a big black cyclopic-like right eye from some unknown incident. His cyborg arms serve many purposes such as cybernetic rope, laser guns, forked harpoon, and welding tool, and his cyborg eye has zoom functions and improves his aim. He is an evil experiment that is a cyborg version of Stitch. He then attempts to put an early ending to their emerging rivalry by proceeding in kidnapping Angel. He is voiced by Paul St. Peter.\n|''Stitch!''\n|-\n|001\n| Red\n|[[Shrink]]\n|[[File:001 - Shrink.png|300 px]]\n|A small purple experiment with a lilac lower jaw and chest, three wobbly legs, two stubby little arms and two floppy antennae with two rings on each antenna. Designed to zap a green ray from his antennae to change the size of objects. His picture appears on the wall of Jumba's lab in ''Leroy & Stitch'', along with several other pictures of Jumba and Dr. H\u00e4msterviel's early accomplishments.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|002\n|\n|[[Doubledip]]\n| A purple opossum-like experiment with two light purple stripes on the back of his ears, beady eyes and an orange nose (in ''Leroy & Stitch'', his nose is dark purple). Designed to double-dip food. His one true place is with Mrs. Hasagawa as one of her \"cats\". He somehow changed in size in ''Leroy & Stitch''.\n|220, ''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|003\n|\n|Howcome\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|004\n|\n|Squawk\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|005\n|\n|Truxx\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|006\n|\n|Percy\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|007\n|\n|[[Gigi]] (also known as \"Yapper\")\n|She is a white Shih Tzu-like experiment with a purple bow. Designed to annoy people with her constant barking. She behaves like a typical \"good dog\": does tricks, licks her owner's face, fetches the morning paper, etc. Because of her appearance and behavior, 007 was adopted by Mertle and wasn't recognized as an experiment until Jumba saw her. Her episode is named \"Yapper\" after the nickname Lilo gave her, but her name is officially given as \"Gigi\" on the experiment name list in ''Leroy & Stitch''. Her one true place is with Mertle as her pet. In ''Leroy & Stitch'', it is revealed that she can speak English very well. At the end of the movie, Mertle joins Lilo and Stitch's ''\u02bbohana'' because Gigi wants to be in it with the rest of Jumba's experiments. She is voiced by Tress MacNeille.\n|108, 118, 209, ''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|008\n|\n|Carmine\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|009\n|\n|[[Pop]]\n| Designed to discombobulate enemies by blowing and popping massive balloons.\n|''Stitch!''\n|-\n|010\n|\n|[[Felix (Lilo & Stitch)|Felix/Oscar]]\n|A green anteater/elephant-like experiment with a small body, mouth, arms and legs, a thin tail with a brushy fuzz at the end, a vacuum-like trunk that can fire lasers, dark eyes, short ears, and three dark-tipped spines. Designed to sterilize, disinfect, and clean everything in sight. However, his programming began to cause him to take extreme and dangerous measures to keep everything clean: he threw anything away, assuming it was trash, and tried to \"sterilize\" anyone, assuming they were germs. 010 was then upgraded by Jumba to make him less of a neat-freak; however, the upgrade malfunctioned, and instead, 010 was turned into a dirt-maker (renamed Oscar), so Lilo gave him to Gantu, who sent 010 to H\u00e4msterviel, who sent him ''back'' to Gantu when Woops almost blew his cover. Felix was later rescued in \"Snafu\". The only word that 010 can say is \"dirty\"; as Felix he says it disgustedly, while when upgraded to \"Oscar\" he exclaims it happily as he makes a mess. Both of 010's nicknames are a reference to the main characters of ''The Odd Couple''. He is voiced by Tress MacNeille.\n|131, 224, 226, ''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|011\n|\n|Inkstain\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|012\n|\n|Antitherm\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|013\n|\n|Furry\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|014\n|\n|[[Kernel]]\n|A tan gourd-shaped experiment with a large opening at the top of his head. Designed to pop popcorn. His one true place is in a movie theatre. Was mentioned in \"Angel\" when Jumba falsely said, \"624 is a harmless ''early'' experiment. Designed to...pop popcorn for Jumba's movie night.\"\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|015\n|\n|Ruggles\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|016\n|\n|Malt\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|017\n|\n|Lidds\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|018\n|\n|Puck\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|019\n|White\n|Clumsy\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|020\n|\n|[[Slick]]\n|A fast-talking, pink experiment with a resemblance to Jumba and Cannonball (520), but with a smaller face and two ebony-black eyes who wears a straw boater hat and bow-tie, carries a cane, and acts as a salesperson who never turns down a customer. Designed to be able to sell anything to anyone. Lilo used him to get ahead in the chocolate bar selling contest/fundraiser, but Mertle took him. When Lilo took him back, Mertle took him back again. Lilo tried to take him back once more, but found out Mertle sold him to Reuben. Slick was rescued, but Lilo had to give up the contest by giving her last chocolate bar to Gantu as a swap for Slick. His one true place is at a fundraiser, following which he began working for charity, not profit. Slick was one of the experiments Lilo turned to for the capture of Ploot, but besides selling her an umbrella that she later used against Ploot, he didn't/couldn't help. He is voiced by Jeff Glen Bennett.\n|205, 217, ''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|021\n|Green\n| Twang\n|Designed to annoy people by playing folk music of Jumba's home planet. In the [[Stitch!|Japanese anime]], it is mentioned that some of Twang's DNA was used by Jumba when he created Experiment 145, giving Bragg the ability to play the folksy flute.<br />\n'''Note:''' Bragg (Experiment 145) was called 021 in the Japanese episode, but still called Bragg. This lead to some media thinking Twang appeared in Stitch!, when Experiment 021 technically hasn't made any appearances, though Bragg was created using some of Twang's DNA. The English dub corrected Bragg's number to 145 and Yuna gave him the name Flute. Twang still has not appeared in any media.\n|''Stitch!''\n|-\n|022\n|Red\n|[[Hertz Donut]]\n|A dark-green, seahorse-like experiment with lips shaped like a doughnut. Designed to project donuts which can restrain and immobilize movement. First he asks, \u201cEver had a Hertz Donut?\u201d Then he fires energy which solidifies into a donut around the target, and says, \u201cHurts, don\u2019t it?\u201d\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|023\n|\n|Cyclo\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|024\n|\n| Hamlette\n|An experiment designed to turn objects into ham, never seen physically. She was activated when Mrs. Hasagawa's cats were activated, as indicated by Gantu's experiment computer, but did not physically appear in the episode. She was referred to in \"Remmy\" when Pleakley said, \"Is that the one that turns everything into ham?\"\n|215, 220\n|-\n|025\n|White\n|[[Topper]]\n|A small yellow star-shaped creature with a little antenna on his head. Designed to be a beacon to signal the alien attack fleet, but the official Disney website states his purpose is to keep people awake with his bright light. Topper is given to a little girl as a Christmas present, then placed atop the local Christmas tree and emits a light so bright that aliens from other galaxies can see him from Earth. His number is likely a reference to Christmas Day (December 25). He is voiced by Tress MacNeille.\n|114, 132, ''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|026\n|\n|Pawn\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|027\n|\n|Plushy\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|028\n|White\n|Lori\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|029\n|\n|[[Checkers]]\n|A yellow centipede-like experiment that sits curled up like a crown on people's heads. Designed to make his wearer a king or queen by hypnotizing those around them, with the exception of other experiments. The victims retain their normal personality while under its control, and the effect immediately wears off once Checkers is removed. Lilo first donned him, but her so-called good intentions got many people arrested by Mertle for being \"troublemakers\" when they accidentally disobeyed Lilo's rules. When Lilo decided to step down, Gantu took Checkers and was in power until Stitch gathered several experiments to help overthrow him.\n|207, ''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|030\n|\n|Vialet\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n| 031\n|\n|[[Gotchu]]\n|An orange lobster-like experiment. Designed to run around and pinches things with his four pincers. His one true place is with Mrs. Hasagawa as one of her \"cats.\"\n| 220, ''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|032\n|\n|[[Fibber]]\n|A small orange experiment with small body, arms and legs, a large head with dark orange mark on the forehead, little antennae, a little mouth, a round nose, black eyes and four ears. Designed to detect lies. When a lie is told, he beeps loudly and the pattern on his forehead lights up. The bigger the lie, the louder he beeps, and the brighter the pattern lights up. Fibber was captured by Gantu, but rescued by Lilo and Stitch in \"Snafu.\" He was also part of Pleakley's E.A.R.W.A.X. group in \"Spike\", which was a blooper in the episode since he was captured by Gantu at the time. He is voiced by Jeff Glen Bennett.\n|113, 201, 224, 226, ''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n| 033\n|\n|[[Hammerface]]\n|A blue dinosaur-like experiment with short forearms and a thick tail and legs. Designed to drive in nails around Jumba's house with his hammer-shaped head/face, but at times he will pound living things. He was used by Gantu to defeat Stitch in \"Dupe\" and rescued by Lilo's rescue team in \"Snafu.\" 033 was called \"Hammerhead\" by Pleakley in \"The Asteroid\". In \"Stitch! The Movie\", his number is 124.\n|109, 126, 213, 215, 224, 226, ''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|034\n|\n|Splort\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|035\n|\n|Philip\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n| 036\n|\n|[[Poki]]\n|A small yellow and brown opossum-like experiment with a spiked tail. Designed to poke holes in liquid containers. He was seen in \"Shoe,\" where he helped turn Jumba's ship into a hotel by putting up an umbrella over an outdoor table and holding a palette for Lilo to paint an arrow sign titled \"Jumba & Pleakley's Bed & Not Breakfast.\"\n|203, 215, ''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|037\n|\n|Snipper\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|038\n|\n|Plats\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|039\n|\n|Atlas\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|040\n|\n|[[Backhoe]]\n|A gray mole-like experiment with large black claws.

Designed to drown people in his sticky sweetness. When he was activated, he was called 119, and he was mistaken for experiment 611. The mistake with his number was due to Jumba's untidy database, although Jumba later corrected this mistake. Was rescued in \"Snafu.\"\n|119, 226\n|-\n|055\n|\n|Snarfhonk\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|056\n|\n|Nibbiolo\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy and Stitch\"''\n|-\n|057\n|\n|Tenderizer\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|058\n|\n|Shortsheet\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|059\n|\n|Tornette\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|060\n|\n|Plink\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|061\n|\n|Anachronator\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|062\n|White\n|[[Frenchfry]]\n|A small gray and white mustachioed experiment with four arms with three fingers on each hand, black eyes, a round nose, a little mouth, short ears, a chef's hat, and a spatula for a tail. Designed to use his lightning speed, which allows him to instantly prepare food or whip up a mini-tornado in battle. He is also the only experiment in the series that speaks French. Designed to be Jumba's personal chef, but instead made unhealthy food that quickly made people fat and overweight, then ate the fattened victims. However, he stopped when he learned that healthy food could be just as delicious. His one true place is running a healthy French fry hut.\n|202, ''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|063\n|\n|Pufferizer\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|064\n|\n|Nappifier\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|065\n|\n|Britfood\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|066\n|\n|Glam\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|067\n|\n|Shady\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|068\n|\n|Tom\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|069\n|\n|H.

Able to capture and confine any other experiment inside the holding tank in his stomach by splitting in half, surrounding whatever he wants to catch, and joining together again. When Clink splits in two, he works with himself, yet he seems to have a separate mind for each half. 20 years in an alternate future, Lilo, Stitch, and Skip encountered Clink in the possession of H\u00e4msterviel, who ruled Earth and the rest of the universe.\n|206\n|-\n|087\n|\n|Puddles\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|088\n|\n|Decrisper\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|089\n|\n|[[Skip]]\n|A pudgy, purple hourglass-shaped experiment with small ears, a big round nose, and a stubby tail. Designed to skip time by 10 minutes, because Jumba was too impatient to wait for his microwave to reheat his leftovers. However, there was an error in his program, so he skips time by ten years instead of ten minutes. Fortunately, he has a reset button on top of his head (seen as a light green patch); when activated, Skip turns upside-down and reverses the time back to normal. Lilo used him to jump ahead 10 years and become a teenager, then 20 years later to become a full-fledged adult. However, since Lilo and Stitch were gone for 20 years, no one was there to catch experiments except Gantu. So 20 years later, H\u00e4msterviel ruled Earth.\n|206, ''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|090\n|\n|Fetchit\n| This experiment was activated when Mrs. Hasagawa's cats were.

[[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] re-purposed some of Experiment 021's DNA when creating him, granting him musical ability. In ''[[Stitch!]]'', [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]] alters his appearance, turning him yellow and more rabbit/cat-like with blue fluff in his ears. H\u00e4msterviel also transmuted Bragg to gain power from sympathy as he tells sad stories and acts generally cute. Bragg is very manipulative and sly. Bragg was designed to be an excellent liar, has super intelligence, extraordinary athletic ability, advanced language programming and musical talent, specifically that of the flute and harmonica, helping him gain the approval of others. He uses popularity and sympathy as steroids, getting stronger as he receives more and more attention. This allows him to grow multiple arms and gain physical muscle mass.\n\n'''Note:''' Bragg was mistakenly called 021 in the Japanese episode and other media, but still referred to by name as Bragg in the Japanese episode.

His body can turn into an electrical current, so he can also fly or travel through outlets, power lines, and machines. He was the first experiment that Lilo and Stitch met and rehabilitated, first appearing in ''[[Stitch! The Movie]]''. His one true place is powering the old [[Kilauea Lighthouse|lighthouse]] that had been abandoned for requiring too much electricity, though he offers Stitch aid. He is voiced by Frank Welker in the series. Sparky also appears as a boss in the PSP game ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep]]'', fighting Terra within Gantu's ship.\n|226, ''Stitch!

Designed to transmit disease to popular planetary leaders and disable them. The symptoms are purple pimples, smelly feet, a swollen eye, and uncontrollable burping. When he turns to good, he is able to cure health problems. Ends up with (actually ''in'') Gantu, until he was rescued in \"Snafu\" and later uses his powers to cure people according to a game in the DVD for ''Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch''. He is voiced by Frank Welker.\n|101, 226\n|-\n|223\n|Green\n|[[Glitch]]\n|A bright green experiment with a round torso, pudgy arms and legs, a large round head with a little mouth, round nose, dark green eyes, a small arrow-shaped mark above his face (in his episode, his marking was originally V-shaped) and two thin antennae that resembles a cross between Morpholomew (316) and Poxy (222). Designed to turn technology against its user by entering machines and making them malfunction, operating like a computer virus. Lilo tricked him into being downloaded into her video game. He was released as of ''Leroy & Stitch'' to help fight the Leroy clones. His one true place is Lilo's video game, rendering the games harder.\n|224\n|-\n|224\n|\n|Tweak\n|Designed to reset important valves and dials to \u201cmaximum chaos.\u201d\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|225\n|\n|Mashy\n|A light blue dinosaur-like experiment, with a huge mouth, with tiny horns above each nostril, 2 large ears, and a large body.

Designed to be so irresistibly cute that he can infiltrate any target area. Other experiments are immune to his charms. Once at his target location, he is a ticking stink bomb. Forty-two hours after his activation, he begins to emit an odor so noxious it will make a 40-square mile area uninhabitable for decades. Luckily, he eventually stops emitting the vile fumes. If 254\u2019s sour emissions intermix with 255\u2019s nauseatingly sweet emissions, the chemical reaction will cause a cataclysmic explosion destroying the planetary body they inhabit. \n\nSomehow he ended up back on Earth in ''Leroy & Stitch'', stench-free, suggesting he can either control the smell or it wears off after a while. He is voiced by Frank Welker.\n|107\n|-\n|255\n|\n|[[Mrs. Sickly]]\n|A light blue experiment with a strong resemblance to Mr. Stenchy (254), with golden eyes, puffier antennae and smaller hair. Designed to make people sick with her nauseatingly sweet fumes. If 255\u2019s emissions intermix with 254\u2019s sour emissions, the chemical reaction will cause a cataclysmic explosion capable of destroying the planetary body they inhabit.\n|''Stitch!''\n|-\n|256\n|\n|Addy\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|257\n|\n|Rattat\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|258\n|White or Blue\n|[[Sample]]\n|A bright orange koala/cat-like experiment with a wide mouth, a big round nose which functions as a microphone, black pupil-less eyes, and big round ears resembling speakers. Designed to annoy enemies by looping random sounds with his mouth or his ears and can also climb walls. His one true place is providing backbeats for an originally rhythm-less musical group. Was in the rescue mission for \"Snafu.\"\n|138, 226\n|-\n|259\n|\n|Rash\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|260\n|\n|GPS\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|261\n|\n|B. V.

When Jumba had his membership revoked from E.G.O. (Evil Genius Organization), Lilo and Stitch tried to trick the head of E.G.O. into thinking that Jumba was still evil. The plan worked until the head of E.G.O. saw a screen of Ace rescuing a cat from a house on fire. His one true place is balancing out Jumba's evil and acting as a local do-gooder. His experiment number \u2013 262 \u2013 is the inverse of 626 \u2013 Stitch's number; Ace is a purely heroic experiment, and Stitch had been designed to be purely destructive, thus the opposite of 262.

He also has a \"wand\" on his head that lights up every time a wish is granted, and is also good for throwing an unsuspecting opponent, like Stitch. Designed to be a wish giver that grants any wish he hears, but the wishes are granted literally and may not turn out quite as expected. In addition to rejecting wishes for more wishes, he also has a wish limit, indicated by a small meter on his stomach which starts out completely red. As wishes are granted, the meter slowly goes down. When white, all the wishes are gone, and 267 is deemed useless.\n|221\n|-\n|268\n|\n|Celsenheit\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|269\n|\n|Gyrotta\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|270\n|\n|Gillmore\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|271\n|\n|Noso\n| Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|272\n|\n|[[Wormhole]]\n|A purple and cyan caterpillar-like experiment with black eyes, two dark purple-tipped antennae, four dark purple-tipped legs and blue mouth inside. Designed to generate portals to parallel universes. However, 272 has no control over which universe the portal leads to. Not naturally evil in nature, 272 has a skittish and sensitive temperament, but also stubborn and loyal to his creator. 272 has advanced language programing to assist him as he traverses alternate realities. Jumba implanted a tracking device into 272 so that he would be able to locate the experiment in whatever universe his creation travels to. Once a transdimensional portal is created, it only lasts for a short period of time. Luckily, 272 has the ability to locate any portal he creates. \n\nAt the end of ''Leroy & Stitch'', 272 is called Mamf and Wormhole is listed as 275, which is Tickle-Tummy's number in ''Stitch!''.\n|''Stitch!''\n|-\n|273\n|\n|Boxboom\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|274\n|\n| Alexander\n|An experiment designed to make lots of long distance telephone calls. He makes calls on your phone to run up the cost on your phone bill.<ref name=\"WinfieldTVTome\" /> One of the 12 new pods found by Lilo & Stitch. His name is obviously taken from Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone.\n| 137\n|-\n|275\n|\n|[[Tickle-Tummy]]\n|A round, pink experiment with rabbit-like ears, no legs, a clownish face, two hands with long fingers and a large patterned torso, which she uses to jump really high. Designed to be able to tickle anyone into submission. She has long fingers that she uses to immobilize people in a state of continuous laughter. This includes Reuben who denied being ticklish. She was caught by Gantu and rescued in \"Snafu\".\n\nTickle-Tummy was originally left off the master list at the end of ''Leroy & Stitch''. She is number 275 in the ''Stitch!'' anime.\n|226, ''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|276\n|Green\n|[[Remmy]]\n|A blue experiment with a huge head that resembles a Pac-Man ghost. Designed to enter a sleeping person's head and turn dreams into nightmares. If the person wakes up while he is still inside, 276 will remain there permanently to turn all future dreams into nightmares. Also, 276 was designed to attack at peak of the subconscious enjoyment. His one true place is making virtual reality games. His name is a reference to the REM stage of sleep, in which dreams occur. He is voiced by Rob Paulsen.\n|215, ''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|277\n|Red or White\n|[[Snooty]]\n|A light purple bat-like experiment with a fur-less, triangle-like body, little legs, two fingers and a thumb on each of his wings, hardly any neck, fanged wide mouth, two little nostrils, pointed ears and black eyes. Designed to find and enrich \"Snootonium,\" a rare element that becomes extremely dangerous once enriched. Snootonium has a similar chemical make-up as that of mucus on Earth. To help clear her sinuses, Lilo's friend Victoria decides to keep Snooty as a pet, as his one true place.\n|213 and 220\n|-\n|278\n|\n|Pasthole\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|279\n|Yellow\n|Futurehole\n|Seen in pod form in the \"Experiment Profiler\" special feature on the DVD of ''[[Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch]]''.

Designed to make 99% of the population silly and useless by pricking them with his spines, leaving only 1% of the population clever (which Jumba used to explain why he never got hurt by one of the quills of Spike). When Lilo discovers Mertle cheating in a contest by getting the answers from Teresa, she uses 319 on Teresa to have her give Mertle completely silly answers. His one true place is hugging and thus taming truant experiments at Pleakley's E.A.R.W.A.X. group, after he is given protective armour to cover his silliness-inducing spines.\n|201\n|-\n| 320\n|\n|[[Cloudy]]\n|A grey cloud-like experiment.

Designed to have all the powers of Stitch, but is a klutz who accidentally bumps into everything. The only thing he can say is, of course, \"Woops.\" His one true purpose is being a valued member of Pleakley's bowling team (because the one thing he can actually do is knock things over, including bowling pins). He is the first prototype of Stitch and is a massive failure.\n|224\n|-\n| 601\n|Blue\n|[[Kixx]]\n|A large, purple, muscular, beastly, Tasmanian Devil-like creature with bulky legs and torso, four strong arms with three fingers on each paw, a blue oval spot on each elbow, short ears, hardly any neck, a wide mouth, a round nose, and black eyes. Designed to be a bully with special kickboxing skills. His one true place is teaching kick-boxing, and has his own instructional video entitled \"Kick-boxing with Kixx\".

Designed to make anything and himself disappear with a blink of his huge eyes, though he can also make them re-appear. His eyes are sensitive to intense light (i.e. camera flashes), which cause him to blink reflexively and randomly make surrounding objects or creatures disappear. He is named after Harry Houdini. His one true place is as a Hollywood magician. He was one of the twelve new pods found by Lilo and Stitch in \"Drowsy\".

Designed to warp the fabric of time and space, causing the entire universe to collapse upon itself. 607 itself never actually appeared in the series, but he was the pod on the sandcastle in 627. [[Rufus (Kim Possible)|Rufus the Mole Rat]] was mistaken for this experiment in the ''Lilo & Stitch''/''[[Kim Possible]]'' crossover episode \"[[Rufus (episode)|Rufus]]\" until Stitch identified him as not being one of the \"cousins\".\n|123, 208\n|-\n| 608\n|Blue\n|[[Slugger]]\n| A small, yellow, pterosaur-like experiment. Designed to deflect projectiles with his tail shaped like a baseball bat.

Designed to fire heat from the black oval in his forehead. Heat was used by Gantu to defeat Stitch but was defeated in \"Dupe\". He is rescued by Lilo and Stitch in \"Snafu\".\n|126, 226\n|-\n| 610\n|Green\n|[[Witch (610)|Witch]]\n|A purple, ghost-like experiment with a white-striped witch hat extending from her head, a yellow heart-shaped mark on her white chest, and wavy arms similar to cloth. She is basically a witch. She was designed to utilize supernatural forces in order to subdue and abduct planetary leaders. Her powers include intangibility, animation, and various other reality-bending abilities. She is capable of possessing individuals and channeling her powers through their vessel. She can be forced out of her victim if she sees her reflection.\n|''Stitch!''\n|-\n|611\n|Blue\n|El Fin (Doomsday)\n| Designed to make the universe implode when Jumba speaks the password.

Designed to make a literally deafening sonic blast. After Pleakley captured him because Stitch could not, he named him with a word from his native planet. His one true place is as an alien invasion alarm and buzzer for Lilo's hula school. He also operates the scoreboard for the game show in \"Spike\".\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|614\n|Blue\n|Gunner\n|Seen in pod form in the \"Experiment Profiler\" special feature on the DVD of ''[[Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch]]''.

Designed to shoot fiery plasma blasts from his nose. His one true place is lighting luau torches. He comes over to Lilo's house when he overheated in \"Slushy\". He later helped fight Slushy with fire against ice. In the episode, Jumba erroneously refers to him as \"515\".\n|117, 127\n|-\n|620\n|\n|Page\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|621\n|\n|[[Chopsuey]]\n|A green, skinny Stitch look-alike with a spiky yellow Mohawk and two prominent fangs jutting from his lower jaw. He has all of Stitch's powers and is jealous of all the attention Stitch gets. In the PlayStation 2 game ''Disney's Stitch: Experiment 626'' he steals the DNA that Stitch collects for Jumba, mutating into a stronger form. The plot of this game has since been retconned from canon continuity due to the events depicting Stitch being apprehended immediately after his creation in ''Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has A Glitch''. However, 621 could still have the same physical appearance and personality. He is both very physical and well-equipped. His weapons include Jet-Pack, Grapple-Gun, rocket-launching Big Gun, and Freeze Gun. The second true prototype of Stitch but he does not appear in the series and has no record from Disney so 625 or Reuben takes this prototype number. He also has the strange ability to mutate when power is charged at most extreme. He is voiced by Frank Welker.\n|''Disney's Stitch: Experiment 626'', ''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|622\n|\n|Jumby\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|623\n|\n|Trainer\n|Function unknown.\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n|624\n|\n|[[Angel]]\n|A pink shapely female experiment with a strong feminine resemblance to Stitch and his primary love interest, with two long tendril-like violet-tipped antennae, violet-tipped ears, small eyelashes, white V-shaped symbol, slightly larger chest puffed out and dark pink Stitch-like back markings (originally upside-down heart-shaped or sometimes gone). Designed to sing a song that turns \"good\" experiments to \"bad\", though it also worked on Jumba. Stitch and Reuben are immune to her song's effect, as they were created after Angel. The spell can be reversed by Angel singing the song backwards or by playing a recording of her song in reverse. She is in love with Stitch and is the closest one to him. Angel was caught by Gantu after defecting from his side out love for Stitch but rescued in \"Snafu\". She is voiced by Tara Strong.\n|125, 215, 226, ''Leroy & Stitch'', ''Stitch Jam'', ''Stitch!''\n|-\n|625\n|Blue or White\n|[[Reuben]]\n|A golden, koala/marmot-like experiment resembling a chubbier version of Stitch with short ears that flop down at the sides of his head, three small antennae that look like a tuft of fluffy fur, pointed fingers, short stumpy legs, hourglass-shaped marking on his back and two flat teeth sticking out of his mouth and overlapping his bottom lip (in the ''Disney Adventures'' Magazine Comics before ''Lilo & Stitch'', he was blue). He is a prototype of Stitch; but while his powers, he is lazy, cowardly, and only makes sandwiches. Only referred to as 625 in the series and ''Stitch! The Movie'', but was finally named Reuben by Lilo during ''Leroy & Stitch''. He speaks English with a hint of a Brooklyn accent. Reuben serves as Gantu's wisecracking sidekick during the series. After receiving his name and working alongside Lilo in ''Leroy & Stitch'', he found his one true place alongside a newly recommissioned (and redeemed) Captain Gantu as his galley officer. He is voiced by Rob Paulsen.\n|''Disney Adventures Magazine'', Most episodes, ''Stitch! The Movie'', ''Leroy & Stitch''\n|-\n| 626\n|\n|[[Stitch]]\n|A blue, koala-like experiment with large rabbit-like ears, a wide mouth, a round nose, black eyes, a small, short, stubby tail, two nose wrinkles, one chin wrinkle, three tuffs of sharp hair on top of his head and on his chest as well as two extra, retractable arms, three retractable spines that run down his back (the first spine is the shortest, then longest, then medium), sharp retractable claws on his front and back paws and two retractable antennae on his head. Designed to be abnormally strong, virtually indestructible, super intelligent and very mischievous. He can think faster than a supercomputer, he is fireproof and bulletproof, can spit acid, can hear in different hearing levels, can see in the dark, can jump really high, can climb up walls and walk on ceilings, can roll into a ball, have super sight and hearing and lift objects 3000 times his own weight (but not an ounce more). His only weakness is water, as he cannot swim due to his molecular density. When he becomes good, he has a heart of gold. His one true place is, of course, as Lilo's \"dog.\" He is the first experiment to be created without Dr. H\u00e4msterviel's funding. He is the most successful experiment Jumba has made. He's also the main character and hero in the series and in the movies. After learning of his older \"cousins\", he and his friend, Lilo, make it their mission to give them a new purpose beyond chaotic mayhem. He has a romantic relationship with Experiment 624, Angel and, later, acts like a brother to both her and Reuben. He is voiced by Chris Sanders. He is the first successful destructing experiment Jumba created after two failures: 600 and 625.\n|All episodes, movies, and magazines\n|-\n|[[627]]\n|Blue\n|N/A\n|A red and yellow, cone-head, purple-nosed, monstrous experiment that looks like a bigger, badder, and worse-mannered version of Stitch, with the same face expression, ear notches at the top of each ear, a wiry body, dark eyes, four extra retractable arms, four retractable spines that run down his back (the first and last spine are the shortest, the second spine is the longest, then medium), black sharp retractable claws on his front and back paws, retractable antennae, an extra retractable head and an alien-like outstretchable mouth. He is the first experiment to be created on Earth with limited alien technology and without Dr. H\u00e4msterviel's funding and serves as Stitch's bitter, villainous rival. Designed to have all the powers/strengths of Stitch and 20 other experiments, but none of their weaknesses, and absolutely no ability to turn to good. All 627 can say is \"evil\". 627 was mostly stronger and healthier than Stitch. 627's other powers include telekinesis, electrokinesis, plasma shoot and ice breath. His only apparent weakness is his loud, uncontrollable laughter. Even though seemingly \"indestructible\", 627 was outwitted and dehydrated back into an experiment pod by Stitch and Lilo, using a commercially available home food dehydrator, and he had been dehydrated for three years. After this, he did not appear again except for in a video recording in \"Mrs. Hasagawa's Cats/Ace\" and a dream sequence in \"Remmy\". He is also briefly mentioned in ''Leroy & Stitch''. He is voiced by Chris Sanders. He is the only experiment to keep his number as a name since Lilo did not give him one.\n| 123\n|-\n|628\n|Blue\n|N/A\n|Created with 627 or after Stitch defeated 627.

Perhaps I will have better luck next time\".\n| 123\n|-\n|629\n|\n|[[Leroy]]\n|Stitch's evil twin, with red fur, frilly ears, yellow teeth, bent antennae, three bent spines on his back, a fluffy tail, and a slightly deeper voice as well as two extra, retractable arms and retractable claws on his front paws. Jumba started creating him from a template similar to Stitch, until Dr. H\u00e4msterviel captured him and forced him to make a \"new version\" of 626. Designed to have all of Stitch's powers, but he also has the ability to disguise himself as Stitch by changing his fur color from red to blue (Dr. H\u00e4msterviel hates the color blue, so he told Jumba to make him resplendent red to match his cape) and instantly regrow his fur. Leroy is very physical, but also makes liberal use of his plasma gun. After naming him \"Leroy\", Dr. H\u00e4msterviel used a cloning machine to create an army, then sent the original Leroy down to Earth to capture the 624 experiments remaining there. Fortunately, Jumba secretly programmed a fail-safe into Leroy before he was charged: If Leroy (or his clones) hears the song \"Aloha Oe\", his nervous system will shut down. After his defeat, Leroy and his clones are all placed in jail with H\u00e4msterviel. Leroy's number is never mentioned in the movie. Jumba tries to call him \"627\", but Gantu reminds him that he's already made experiment 627. He is voiced by Chris Sanders. He and all his clones are sent to jail at the end of the movie, where they are seen happily dancing to \"Jailhouse Rock\".\n|''Leroy & Stitch''\n|}\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*According to [[Jess Winfield]], during the development of ''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]'', the idea of it focusing on \"the other 625 experiments\" was birthed from an idea by artist and director Steve Lyons who \"suggested that an evil villain clone [[Stitch]] into a bunch of different creatures that [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and Stitch would chase.\" Also, the phrase \"the other 625 experiments\" was coined either by Winfield himself, [[Bobs Gannaway]], or possibly Barry Blumberg, although Winfield doesn't remember who was first to say it.<ref name=\"WinfieldTVTome\" />\n*''[[Disney's Stitch: Experiment 626]]'' featured an experiment series numbered as 700, which were mass-produced by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] and served as enemies in the game.\n*In ''[[Stitch!]]'', eleven previously unseen experiments created by Jumba were introduced in addition to two experiments created by someone other than Jumba. The first, called [[Skunkuna]], was created by [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]], and the second was [[Dark End]], created by [[Delia]]. Since neither were created by Jumba, they do not fall under his numbering scheme.\n*In ''[[Stitch & Ai]]'', Jumba [[Jumba's Chinese Experiments|creates new experiments]] based on ancient scrolls he is given. Most are based on [[China|Chinese]] mythical creatures, while others appear to be derived from some creatures. It is unknown whether or not Jumba considers these experiments a part of his existing numbering scheme.\n*According to the series episode \"[[Skip (episode)|Skip]]\" (as seen on a monitor) and the [[Magic Kingdom]] attraction [[Stitch's Great Escape!]] (as seen on wanted posters in the exit halls of the attraction), the official shorthand prefix for \"Experiment\" is \"X-\" (X with a hyphen). In addition, Jumba referred to [[Spooky]] as \"X-300\" (ex three hundred) and [[Kixx]] as \"X-601\" (ex six-oh-one) in their respective [[Spooky (episode)|eponymous]] [[Kixx (episode)|episodes]], further supporting this.\n*To date, there are only 125 of Jumba's experiments that have appeared and have their names, numbers, and functions confirmed. This includes Coco who has only appeared in the ''[[Disney Adventures]]'' comics and was confirmed by Jess Winfield, [[Chopsuey|Experiment 621]] from ''[[Disney's Stitch: Experiment 626]]'', and [[Cyber|Experiment 000]] who first appeared in ''Stitch!''. This numbering scheme does not count the new experiments Jumba made in ''Stitch & Ai'' as stated above.\n**Experiments 021, 024, 099, 143, 224, 274, 321, 340, 400, 412, 413, 414, and 415 have their names, numbers, and functions confirmed, but have never physically appeared.\n**Experiments 607 and 611 have their names, numbers, and functions confirmed, but have never physically appeared, yet have appeared as stylized graphics on [[Jumba's Computer|Jumba's computer]] and the [[Experiment Pod Container|experiment pod container]]'s screen, respectively.\n**[[627|Experiment 627]] has physically appeared, but was never given an official name.\n**Experiments 347 and 531 have appeared in the comics, but do not have their functions confirmed.\n**There are several experiments that have appeared in DVD bonus features, comics, and ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]'' that have never been assigned to a name and number.\n**Of the 123 experiments that have appeared and been confirmed (including [[Stitch]]), ''[[Stitch! The Movie]]'' introduced 7 experiments, the original series introduced a total of 91 with 44 of them appearing in Season 1 and 47 appearing in Season 2, ''Leroy & Stitch'' introduced 13, and ''Stitch!'' introduced 11 (excluding Dark End, Skunkuna, and the [[Sproutling]]s).\n** We have met 20% of Jumba's experiments in [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|the franchise]] that have their names, numbers, and functions confirmed, while we only know around 22% of the experiments' functions.\n\n=== Continuity errors===\n\n*Several experiments have been given multiple numbers, such as [[Bonnie (Lilo & Stitch)|Bonnie]] and [[Clyde (Lilo & Stitch)|Clyde]], who are called 349 and 350 in [[Bonnie & Clyde|their episode]], but called 149 and 150 in the end credits of ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''. The same goes for [[Finder]] and [[Ploot]], who are called 458 and 515 in their [[Finder (episode)|respective]] [[Ploot (episode)|episodes]], but called 158 and 505 in the end credits of ''Leroy & Stitch''.\n*Many of the experiments that appear in the background during the Aloha Stadium battle in ''Leroy & Stitch'' are duplicates or recolors and slight edits of existing experiments. They were put in as screen fillers to make it appear as if all 626 experiments were actually there. For example, [[Houdini]] appears five times in the frame, while [[Cannonball]] appears eight times; twice recolored, twice re-edited and four times copied. [[Phoon]] is also seen twice in the scene, both in normal and mutated form.\n*Experiment 272 was listed as \"Mamf\" in the end credits of ''Leroy & Stitch''. However, in ''Stitch!'', [[Wormhole]] is called 272 while 275 is given to [[Tickle-Tummy]], who was mistakenly left off the list in the movie. When asked about the numbers of theses three, Jess Winfield stated: \"The best I can tell you about Tickletummy/Wormhole is that Jumba's genius does not extend to keeping a tidy [[Jumba's Computer|database]]. There is some confusion in his records regarding Tickletummy, Wormhole, and a third experiment named Mamf, with different lists giving different numbers for them. Perhaps it will be sorted out someday.\"\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nStitch experiments wallpaper.jpg|Experiment artwork from [[Japan]]\nExperiments Group Shot.jpg|Pre-release artwork from ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''\nGroupphoto.jpg|Japanese puzzle art based on the family photo scene at the end of ''Leroy & Stitch''\nLilo & Stitch Club BV JP wallpaper.jpg|Japanese computer desktop wallpaper\nStitch and experiments.jpg|Early artwork of experiments and the [[Experiment Pod Container]]\nStitch-experiments and ohana.jpg|The [[Pelekai \u02bbohana|Pelekai ''\u02bbohana'']] with a small selection of experiments.\nStitch-the-movie-ad-wallpaper.jpg|Experiments causing a mess in the Pelekais' kitchen.\nStitch cousin Infographic.jpg|Infographic\nStitch and Experiments puzzle.jpg|Japanese jigsaw puzzle featuring Stitch, Jumba, H\u00e4msterviel, and a number of experiments.\nLilo & Stitch Hawaiian Market puzzle.jpg|Yanoman ''Lilo & Stitch'' Hawaiian Market jigsaw puzzle\nLilo & Stitch The Series French 12 DVD set cover.jpg|''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]'' [[France|French]] DVD box set cover featuring rare official artwork of several experiments.\nCousins List Disney Tsum Tsum - 1 to 9.png|Nine experiments as they appear as Tsums in ''[[Disney Tsum Tsum (game)|Disney Tsum Tsum]]''.\nCosuins List Disney Tsum Tsum - 10 to 18.png|Another nine experiments as they appear as Tsums in ''Disney Tsum Tsum''.\nExpList.jpg|The end credits listing from ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''\nExpList2.jpg\nExperiment puzzle page.jpg|An old printout with some promotional games for ''[[Stitch!
