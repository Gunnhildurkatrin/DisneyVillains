He is also best friends with Toejam. He likes to call himself the \"Funny Kid With The Curly Hair\" (As seen in his rap). He has a huge crush on the most popular girl in school, Tiffany Blake, and when he gets nervous he starts saying \"Uh Uh Uh\" until he gets a chance to run away. In one episode he pretends to be his fake uncle, Uncle Kipper, who is a janitor. At the end it turns out that Uncle Kipper is real and that he is a janitor. In another episode Skipper starts to like Lexi and when Toejam told Tiffany she chained her self to Skipper's locker while Skipper chains himself to Lexi's locker. But in an ironic twist they are both told by Toejam \"You do realize that's not her/his locker?\", while they are chained two lockers away from each other. Then Toejam says \"I'll get the jaws of life\".\n\n==Romantic Life==\n===[[Tiffany Blake]]===\nFrom the first season, it is made clear that Skipper has a crush on\u00a0Tiffany Blake, but Tiffany does not know it.\n===[[Lexi Adams]]===\nIn\u00a0Skipper's Away, he grows a crush on\u00a0Lexi.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Skipper claims that he had kissed a girl named Maryanne in first grade, who turns out to be a mannequin.\n*Coincidently, Skipper shares a similar last name with Charlotte and Lexi, with their last name being \"Adams\" and Skippers' being \"Adamson\".\n*It is unknown if Skipper is actually his name or just a nickname, in this case Skipper is only character who's real name is unknown.\n*Skipper has an uncle called Kipper, who works in the school as a janitor.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Adamson, Skipper}}\n[[Category:As The Bell Rings (U.S.) characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
