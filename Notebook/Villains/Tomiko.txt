She is a student at the Avalor Science Academy.\n\n==Background==\n===Physical Appearance===\nTomiko is a light-skinned teenager with brown eyes and black hair tied in pigtails.\n\n===Personality===\nTomiko is a very friendly girl. She loves the Royal Family and respects Isabel for her smarts. Like her classmates, she doesn't like Javier as she finds him insufferable.\n\n==Role in the Series==\nTomiko makes her debut appearance in the episode, \"[[Class Act]]\".\n\nShe first appears in [[Professor Ochoa]]'s class. When Princess Elena and Princess Isabel arrive, Tomiko is overjoyed, especially after Isabel gets picked to be her lab partner. When Javier starts being rude to Isabel, Tomiko tells her to just ignore him. When their first project falls apart, Tomiko is sad to see Isabel leave and overjoyed when she comes back and builds a second machine. When Javier throws a tantrum over their project getting picked, a clamp pops out from underneath his book. Isabel recognizes it as the missing clamp from their first machine. When Elena reveals that Javier stole it, Tomiko realizes that that's why their first machine broke and angrily realizes that Javier deliberately sabotaged them. After Javier gets suspended, Tomiko continues to work with Isabel.\n\nTomiko returns in \"[[Shooting Stars]]\", where she helps Elena and Isabel set up the observatory's new telescope for [[Francisco|the princesses' grandfather]] to see a comet. But the lens on the telescope is shattered by lightning, so the trio works together to make a new lens. When Elena's new magic kicks in and gets her trapped in a shed, Tomiko and Isabel get distracted from heating the flux, causing it to overheat, and Tomiko sadly says that the reaction will require more energy, which they don't have. When Elena voices how she's no good at science, Tomiko says that she wasn't born knowing all the scientific terms; she had to study, learn, and practice. Elena asks how hot metal has to get to melt, and Tomiko replies, \"Extremely hot. Why do you ask?\", to which Elena replies that lightning could provide enough energy to make the new lens, to Isabel and Tomiko's approval. The girls use their lightning rod to reheat the flux and make the new lens for the telescope.\n\n==Trivia==\n* Due to the fact that the name Tomiko has Japanese origin (Tomiko=\u5bcc\u5b50), it is possible that Tomiko is originally from [[Satu]] since Satu is a kingdom inspired by [[Japan]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nClass Act (13).png\nClass Act (15).png\nClass Act (17).png\nClass Act (18).png\nClass Act (19).png\nClass Act (20).png\nClass Act (22).png\nTomiko's Elena key.jpg|Looks like she's ''still'' crazy about Elena\n</gallery>\n\n{{Elena of Avalor}}\n[[Category:Elena of Avalor characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Asian characters]]\n[[Category:Japanese characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
