His body was covered with coral and barnacles, making him almost indistinguishable from the hull of the ''Dutchman''. His right arm holds a ship's lantern.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|Dead Man's Chest]]''===\nOnboard the ''[[Flying Dutchman]]'' in a plan to find the key for the [[Dead Man's Chest]], [[Will Turner]] devises a plan with his father [[Bootstrap Bill Turner]] in order to find [[Davy Jones|Captain Davy Jones]]' weakness which is his heart to which a camouflaged Wyvern overhears Will's plan. Emerging from the hull, Wyvern explains that when one opens the chest, inside is the heart of Davy Jones, which is the captain's weakness. He warns them that if the ''Dutchman'' has no captain, there would be no one to take control of the ship. As Will asks him to know where the key and the chest are at, he explains that the objects he and his father need to find are hidden. His further fate is unknown afterwards, though it is likely that during the events of ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|At World's End]]'' that he reverted back to his human form, along the rest of the crew of the ''Dutchman'' after Davy Jones' defeat.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Because he was not seen during the events of ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|At World's End]]'', it is likely that he reverted back to his human form ever since [[Davy Jones]] fell to his death during battle at the maelstrom and when Will Turner becomes the new captain of the ''[[Flying Dutchman]]''.\n**Also in the original script for ''At World's End'', Wyvern had a small talk with [[James Norrington]] after battle.\n*\"[[Wikipedia:Wyvern|Wyvern]]\" is also the name of a type of dragon in heraldry.\n\n==External links==\n*[https://pirates.fandom.com/wiki/Wyvern Wyvern] on [https://pirates.fandom.com/wiki/ Pirates of the Caribbean Wiki].\n\n{{Pirates of the Caribbean}}\n[[Category:Pirates of the Caribbean characters]]\n[[Category:Sailors]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
