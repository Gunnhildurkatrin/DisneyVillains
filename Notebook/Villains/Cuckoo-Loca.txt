She lives inside a cuckoo clock inside Minnie's bow shop. In the series, she is Minnie and Daisy 's friend who often helps her friends with whatever is going on in the shop.\n\nIn ''Cuckoo-Loca's Egg-Celent Adventure'', she has to take care of a lost bird's egg while Minnie and Daisy look for its mother. In the end, she accidentally breaks open the egg, and as it turns out, it contains another cuckoo bird toy.\n\n===''[[Mickey and the Roadster Racers]]''===\n\nCuckoo-Loca takes the part of a recurring character in the series. Like in ''[[Minnie's Bow-Toons]]'', Cuckoo-Loca also lives inside a cuckoo clock inside the office of the Happy Helpers (Minnie and Daisy). When the Happy Helpers are needed and go to the Happy Helpers' Van (which also transforms into Minnie's Daily Driver and Pink Thunder Racer), Cuckoo Loca rides in too and helps the Happy Helpers when needed.\n\nIn ''[[Happy Friend-iversary]]'', it reveals that Cuckoo-Loca met [[The Sensational Six]] when Minnie and Daisy moved into the Happy Helper\u2019s when it was an antique shop. She was also the assistant of the original owner Mr. McSpanial before he moved to be closer to his family.\n\n===''[[Mickey Mouse Funhouse]]''===\nCuckoo-Loca appears in the series as a recurring character. She first appeared in ''[[Mickey the Brave!]]'' as an innkeeper of a village that was being damaged by a friendly but gullible and curious dragon.\n\n===''[[Mickey's Tale of Two Witches]]''===\n\n== Trivia ==\n* \"Loca\" is the Spanish word in female for \"crazy\". Her name is probably a reference to when people compare someone crazy with a cuckoo bird.\n* There was a long running gag in the series where Cuckoo-Loca makes sarcastic remarks about the Happy Helper's jingle, once Minnie and Daisy are finished singing it.\n* She has the exact same New York accent as that of [https://sonic.wikia.com/wiki/Sticks_the_Badger Sticks the Jungle Badger] from ''Sonic Boom'', who is also voiced by Nika Futterman.\n* Although she met Minnie and Daisy in Happy Friend-Aversary, Cuckoo-Loca was shown with her friends and their boyfriends as infants in ''[[Happy Thanksgiving Helpers!]]''.\n{{Mickey Mouse & Friends}}\n{{Mickey Mouse Clubhouse}}\n{{Mickey and the Roadster Racers}}\n{{Mickey Mouse Funhouse}}\n[[Category:Minnie's Bow-Toons characters]]\n[[Category:Birds]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Magical Objects]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey and the Roadster Racers characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Mechanics]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Cousins]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse Funhouse characters]]\n[[Category:Robots]]"
