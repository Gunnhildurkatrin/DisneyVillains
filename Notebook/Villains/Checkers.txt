'''Experiment 029''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]]. He is designed to give his wearer the power of command over all living creatures, with the exception of other experiments as well as the blind and nearsighted; his hypnotic effects vanish instantly as soon as he leaves his wearer's head.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nCheckers hasn't shown much emotion or individuality, other than once while running from [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]]. He mostly attaches himself to a person and stays there, almost as if he was an inanimate object.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nCheckers is a yellow and purple crown-shaped centipede-like experiment with black eyes, a dark pink nose, and four pairs of legs that sits curled up like a crown on people's heads.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nCheckers can hypnotize those around his current wearer to worship the aforesaid wearer like royalty. His eyes flash purple when causing the hypnosis, and his effects are undone as soon as he leaves his wearer's head. Only the experiments created after Checkers are immune to his hypnotic effect.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment 029 was the 29th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to make his wearer a king or queen by hypnotizing those around them to worship them as royalty. 029 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch |Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.\n\nExperiment 029 was activated off-screen and then chased throughout [[Kokaua Town]] by\u00a0[[Captain Gantu|Gantu]], who had been informed about the experiment after making a vain attempt to kill [[Reuben|Experiment 625]]'s pet cockroach named [[Jimmy the Cockroach|Jimmy]]. 029 was eventually rescued by [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Stitch]] and taken [[Lilo's House|home]].\n\nAfter Lilo discovered 029's powers, the former named him Checkers and donned him, thus becoming a queen.\u00a0She then started bossing [[Nani Pelekai|Nani]] and other individuals around, even\u00a0[[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], and made [[Mertle Edmonds|Mertle]] and [[Elena, Teresa, and Yuki|the hula girls]] her bodyguards.\n\nBefore long, Mertle and the hula girls arrested many \"troublemakers\" for defying their queen (including [[Pleakley]]), so Lilo decided to step down by removing Checkers. However, before she could figure out his one true place, Gantu arrived and grabbed Checkers. After putting the latter on his head, thus becoming a king, Gantu made his victims his servants.\n\nFortunately, Stitch and Reuben were immune to Checkers' hypnotic effect, and both rallied an army of other experiments that attacked Gantu and were able to remove Checkers from his head, overthrowing him. As a result, Gantu's ex-servants revolted against him. After the rebellion, Lilo thought of Checkers' one true place.\n\nAlthough his one true place was never revealed, Checkers and the other experiments, along with Jumba and Pleakley, later watched Nani during the Coconut Queen Festival parade as she rode atop a parade float that Lilo, the hula girls, and Stitch's cousins had modified sometime earlier.\n\n===''[[The Origin of Stitch]]''===\nCheckers was one of the experiments that were gliding on the screen, but he is 553 instead of 029.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nThe first 624 experiments, including Checkers, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium\u00a0to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]] and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nCheckers participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]], but it is unknown what he did. However, it is presumed that he wouldn't have been able to be very effective, due to the fact that his powers are deemed useless.\n\nThe Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.\n\n===''[[Stitch!]]''===\nCheckers has appeared on multiple occasions in the ''Stitch!'' anime. It is also revealed that he will jump off of his host if he eats intolerably spicy foods. He premiered in\u00a0\"Princess Penny\", where\u00a0[[Reuben]] used Checkers to temporarily rule over [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] and [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]] before taking him on a shopping trip and then asking [[Stitch]] and [[Yuna Kamihara|Yuna]] to watch him while Reuben bought some supplies. Also, when Checkers was being worn on the head of [[Penny (Stitch!)|Penny]], he ate some of her spicy sandwich and a hot pepper, causing him to leap off his host.\n\nCheckers reappeared\u00a0in \"King Meega\", intended to be used by H\u00e4msterviel to command the inhabitants to capture Stitch, but had escaped\u00a0on his own to Yuna's school, where everyone intended to use his powers for themselves. Stitch once captured Checkers and wore him on his head, but his hypnotic powers did not work on anyone else. [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] recalls that Checkers' powers do not work on Stitch, as\u00a0he\u00a0himself is immune to Checkers'\u00a0effects. (This actually contradicts what happened in \"Princess Penny\", as Reuben had used Checkers himself without any problems.)\n\nCheckers also appeared in the special ''Stitch and the Planet of Sand''.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Checkers was\u00a0activated off-screen.\n*The [[Experiment Pod Container]] describes Checkers as: \"Experiment 029. Primary function: King maker. Gives his wearer power of command over all living creatures.\"\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
