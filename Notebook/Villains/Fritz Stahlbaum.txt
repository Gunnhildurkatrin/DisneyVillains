He is the younger brother of [[Louise Stahlbaum|Louise]] and [[Clara Stahlbaum|Clara]].\n\n==Role in the film==\nFritz is first seen watching Clara's experiment of using a contraption that is able to catch any invading mouse. Later, he and Clara go downstairs to meet their father, [[Benjamin Stahlbaum|Benjamin]], who gives Fritz some toy soldiers from his late mother, [[Marie Stahlbaum|Marie]]. He later follows up with Clara on their way to [[Drosselmeyer]]'s mansion where Benjamin tells him to have table manners when eating, just as Fritz eats a biscuit. He and his relatives are accepted into the invitation. When Drosselmeyer presents everyone their gifts, Fritz grabs a name tag with his name so that he can find his gift, which is a nutcracker soldier, followed by Clara following the tag all the way to the Christmas Tree Forest.\n\nLater when Clara returns home and happily reunites with Benjamin, Fritz, and Louise happily gaze upon the couple dancing to the music that Marie once listened to before her death just as he and Louise dance in couple. Back at home, the Stahlbaum family dances together to the waltz along with the other party guests.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nNutcracker -Four-Realms-Final-Trailer-4.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Nutcracker and the Four Realms}}\n\n[[Category:The Nutcracker and the Four Realms characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Males]]"
