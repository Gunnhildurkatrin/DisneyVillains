He is shown in a flashback in the ''[[The Little Mermaid (TV series)|Little Mermaid]]'' episode \"[[Calliope Dreams]]\".\n\n==Background==\n===Physical appearance===\nLike his grandson, Triton, Neptune has golden armbands and a blue tail, but he is never seen wearing a golden crown.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[The Little Mermaid (TV series)|The Little Mermaid: The Series]]''===\nNeptune appears in \"[[Calliope Dreams]]\" during a flashback to Triton's childhood. When Triton was young, Neptune would play the sea calliope nightly at bedtime. Triton would stay warm by the light of an electric eel and would listen to the calliope play until he fell asleep. Afterward, Neptune would carry his grandson to bed and tuck him in.\n\nOne day, when Neptune and Triton went to the room the calliope was in, they found the calliope completely destroyed. Unbeknownst to either of them, the ancient [[Seaclops]] was the one responsible, as the creature found the calliope's music disturbing.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\ncalliopedreams51.jpg\ncalliopedreams54.jpg\nCalliopedreams56.jpg\nCalliopedreams57.jpg\nneptune goodnight.jpg\nNeptune luv u 2.jpg\ncalliopedreams68.jpg\ncalliopedreams69.jpg\ncalliopedreams70.jpg\ncalliopedreams71.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Little Mermaid}}\n[[Category:Kings]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Grandparents]]\n[[Category:The Little Mermaid characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Mermen]]\n[[Category:Hybrids]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Widows/Widowers]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
