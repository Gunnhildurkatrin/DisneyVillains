She is a businesswoman who takes over leadership of Glomgold Industries in the absence of [[Flintheart Glomgold]].\n\n\n\n==Background==\nAfter graduating at the Mouseton School of Business, Zan Owlson moved to Duckburg and started her own global charity called \"Change for Chicks\", not long after that she became the new CEO of the Glomgold Industries due to the mysterious disappearance of its former CEO, Flintheart Glomgold.\n\n===Personality===\nZan Owlson is a determined, hard-working, and smart woman. She graduated at the top of her class at the Mouseton School of Business and created a Global Charity called Change for Chicks. She also is charismatic, being preferred as the CEO of the Glomgold Industries by the public over Flintheart Glomgold. She is extremely sensible and is very reasonable with others, although she slowly becomes annoyed and disillusioned with the billionaires of Duckburg and their constant wild plights, especially Glomgold, whom she constantly has to keep an eye on due to his unorthodox and clearly dysfunctional schemes. She has a clear dislike of working for Glomgold, who is  a constant headache to her, and showed obvious happiness at the prospect of working for Scrooge, showing her true desire to be apart of a stable business without having to deal with crazy and wild schemes. Unfortunately, Owlson\u2019s ideals for a properly functioning business are once again shattered when Louie took over as the new CEO of McDuck and she wishes forced to work for him now. Eventually, Owlson\u2019s patience reaches its peak and she lashes out on everyone, revealing her pent up chagrin at Duckburg\u2019s billionaires both having the minds of and actually being children with their constant schemes and adventures. From this moment onwards, Owlson vows to become a more successful billionaire than all of them and actually handle things in a sane matter, before leaving Duckburg and becoming the mayor of St. Canard. She proves to be very successful in this, being a very capable leader of the city.\n\n===Physical Appearance===\nOwlson is a female owl with dark brown hair.

She appears again at the end of the episode, having a business meeting with [[Scrooge McDuck]] before being interrupted by Glomgold kicking the door shouting his name and claiming to be back and making a bet with Scrooge, that the one who is the richest duck in the world by the end of the year wins the other's company.\n\nIn \"[[The 87 Cent Solution!]]\", she tries to Glomgold win the wager by reminding him of N.E.S.T\u00a0(No Elaborate Schemes today) and advises to use Scrooge's methods, due to Scrooge's ''gold fever ''Glomgold's stock is skyrocketing there for making him \"Richest Duck in the World\" Owlson congratulations him; And when Scrooge supposedly dies of Gold Fever, Glomgold crashed Scrooge's funeral Owlson is shocked and drags her boss to a seat to inform him this was wildly inappropriate after, Glomgold admits he was the perpetrator behind everything by using the Time Teaser device, Scrooge shows up alive.\n\nIn \"[[Raiders of the Doomsday Vault!]]\", Owlson accompanies Glomgold to Von Drake labs in Boarway for a presentation about the Doomsday Vault to convince the current owners to hire Glomgold Industries, when Glomgold says he wants to use the vault's Money Tree, Owlson means to blow the Von Drake children's' minds with how to secure the vault will be for half the price. But, due to Glomgold going back to his scheme of stealing the tree they lose the contract to Scrooge.\n\nIn \"[[GlomTales!]]\", Owlson congratulates Scrooge on his victory on the wager and looks forward to working for him, just then the Iron Vulture arrives with Glomgold and\u00a0villains. With the resources of the villains combined, they had gained more money than Scrooge did; Glomgold has won the wager, leaving her shock. Suddenly, Louie reveals Glomgold's real name, Duke Baloney.\u00a0As Flintheart Glomgold is a false identity, the money will instead go to Llewelyn Duck (which is him).\n\nIn \"[[The Richest Duck in the World!]]\", Owlson starts work for Louie but then realizes what a terrible person he is. When Bombie manages to board the Sunchaser, and Louie's excuses and entitled behavior finally push Owlson to the breaking point she quit and announcing her intention to become her own billionaire-and putting in her two weeks' notice.\n\nSometime between the events of season two and \"[[Let's Get Dangerous!]]\", Owlson somehow became the Mayor of [[St. Canard]].\n\nIn \"[[The Last Adventure!]]\", Owlson is revealed to have been kidnapped by [[F.O.W.L.]], along with numerous other characters, in an effort to eradicate all adventure related things from existence.
