She is also the only female in the [[Central Park Zoo|zoo]] group. Bridget is insecure and easily pampered. She is\u00a0quick-witted and wants to be seen as strong and independent. Bridget is also witty and noted for her great sarcasm. She respects [[Samson (The Wild)|Samson]] and is good friends with [[Larry]]. She finds [[Nigel]] annoying at times (but is also his friend), and loves [[Ryan]] like her own cub. She at first finds Benny super irritating and boring, but when Benny falls off the garbage truck, she shows great concern. At the film's climax, she later warms up to Benny and finally kisses him, which makes Benny shocked and happy. Bridget is often noted for her beauty both inside and out, quoted as a goddess by Nigel.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nThe Wild Bridget Butt.jpg|Bridget falling down and accidentally sitting on Benny\nThe wild nigel hits bridget.jpg|Nigel (who is now the wildebeests' king) hitting Bridget with his torch\nJuly31st.png|Bridget in ''[[Disneystrology]]''\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Wild}}\n[[Category:The Wild characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Giraffes]]\n[[Category:Zoo Animals]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]"
