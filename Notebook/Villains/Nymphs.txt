They can take on a human form with brown, orange, blue, green or aqua skin color. In the animated series a nymph named Syrinx has a family of male tree-like entities, if these creatures are male nymphs or not is never explained; these \"males\" can only take on a partially humanoid form (resembling trees or bushes with faces). The nymphs reside on [[Phil's Island]] and [[Philoctetes]] enjoys spending his time peeping on the females.\n\n==Notable Nymphs==\n===Sea Nymphs===\n[[File:SeaNymphs.JPG|thumb|Sea Nymphs.]]\nThey reside on tropical islands and are in service to [[Echidna's Children#Gegenies|Gegenies]], a giant 6-armed yeti who spares their lives in exchange for the life of sailors they lure to the island.\n\n===[[Syrinx]]===\n[[File:Syrinx.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Syrinx with Phil.]]\nA female tree nymph who resides on [[Phil's Island]]. Unlike the rest of the nymphs she apparently enjoys [[Philoctetes|Phil]]'s company and seems to be in a relationship with him. However, she was upset with Phil when he forbid Hercules from dancing (considering it \"un-manly\"). She tells him he's just as stubborn and hard-headed as her father, who disapproves of her relationship with a satyr. She appeared in ''Hercules and the Muse of Dance''.\n\n====Syrinx's family====\n[[File:SyrinxFamily.JPG|thumb|250px|Syrinx's father (right) and the rest of her family.]]\nSyrinx's family includes her father and three brothers. None of them are happy with her dating a satyr, especially not her father. Their attitudes changed when Phil saved her from a fire her father caused.\n\n===Styx===\nIn ''Hercules and the River Styx''. Styx is technically a Naiad, or fresh-water nymph.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the original myth, nymphs were a female-only species.\n*If Phil's Island is Rhodes where the nymphs live then, the water nymph in the film could possibly be Rhode (daughter of [[Poseidon]]).\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nOnce Upon a Time - 7x19 - Flower Child - Grove.jpg|Tree Nymphs in ''Once Upon a Time''\nOnce Upon a Time - 7x19 - Flower Child - Flora and Gothel.png\nDSA_Nymph.png|Model for [[Disney Sorcerer's Arena]]\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*{{WP}}\n*{{OUAT|Tree Nymphs|Tree Nymphs}}\n{{Hercules}}\n{{Once Upon a Time}}\n[[fr:Nymphes]]\n[[Category:Hercules characters]]\n[[Category:Greek Mythology]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Mystical animals]]\n[[Category:Once Upon a Time characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Fairies]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Sorcerer's Arena Characters]]"
