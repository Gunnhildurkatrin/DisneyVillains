'''Experiment 320''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba_Jookiba|Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]]. He is designed to depress others with constant rain. His one true place is raining on [[Mrs. Hasagawa]]'s produce at her [[Hasagawa Fruits|fruit stand]], suggesting he may be one of her \"cats\".\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment 320 was the 320th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to depress others with constant rain.\n\n320 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.\n\nAt some point, 320 was presumably activated, captured, and named Cloudy.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nCloudy was seen early in the movie raining on [[Mrs. Hasagawa]]'s [[Hasagawa Fruits|fruit]] as [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] was making her rounds with [[Scrump]] to make sure all the experiments were happy in the one true place they belonged.\n\nLater, the first 624 experiments, including Cloudy, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, Lilo, [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]] and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nIt is unknown whether or not Cloudy participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]].\n\nThe Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]],\" which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Cloudy is the only known experiment associated with [[Mrs. Hasagawa]] that did not debut in the episode \"[[Mrs. Hasagawa's Cats]]\".\n*While it is confirmed that Cloudy works with Mrs. Hasagawa, it remains unconfirmed whether Cloudy returns home with her from the [[Hasagawa Fruits|fruit stand]].\n*Cloudy is one of three known limbless experiments, the other two being [[Slimy]] and [[Zap]].\n*Cloudy, Zap, [[Remmy]], [[Welco]], and [[Shrink]] are the only known experiments that are always seen levitating.\n**[[Phantasmo]] and [[Witch (Lilo & Stitch)|Witch]] primarily levitate but often possess objects or living beings to move by other means. [[Tickle-Tummy]] is also able to levitate, but has been seen bouncing as well.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\">\nVlcsnap-2012-07-03-20h49m53s141.png\nvlcsnap-2013-07-22-19h11m32s79.png\nVlcsnap-2012-07-03-21h08m16s165.png\nVlcsnap-2013-05-23-20h17m26s194.png\nvlcsnap-2013-07-22-19h10m25s135.png|Cloudy captured by [[Leroy]]\nVlcsnap-2012-08-02-18h52m40s172.png\nvlcsnap-2013-03-14-08h53m28s95.png\nVlcsnap-2013-02-08-11h58m00s88.png\nVlcsnap-2013-03-30-19h50m30s116.png\nvlcsnap-2013-07-07-22h53m14s184.png\nVlcsnap-2013-05-21-14h09m47s96.png\nVlcsnap-2013-03-30-19h52m36s223.png\nVlcsnap-2013-03-14-09h38m47s233.png\nScreenCapture 03.04.13 14-16-57.jpg\nVlcsnap-2012-07-03-22h16m18s43.png\nUnknowncloud.jpg\nStitch Now - Cloudy.jpg|Cloudy in ''[[Stitch!Now]]''\n</gallery>\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
