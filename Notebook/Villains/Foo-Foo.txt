She is the pet dog of [[Killjoy Margaret]].\n\n==Personality==\nFoo-Foo is as stuck up as her owner. Whenever Flying John becomes distracted, she also imitates Killjoy Margaret's anger much to Margaret's chagrin.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Fantasia 2000]]''===\nFoo-foo is first seen leaving a hotel building along with her owner and [[Flying John]]. When John attempts to have fun, Margaret becomes enraged just as Foo-Foo growls at him. Later when John and Margaret pass by a peanut machine by playing with a nearby monkey, Foo-Foo and her owner continue walking to a pet store known as \"Le Pampered Pooche\" where Margaret buys many stuff for her pet dog, making John feel overwhelmed about the number of items accumulated. Foo-Foo and Margaret are last seen at the end of the segment where Margaret and John walk alongside together only for the dog and her owner to be caught by a construction hook pushed by a pipe during [[Joe (Fantasia)|Jobless Joe]]'s routine. Fortunately, John manages to join a jazz club much to Margaret's protests of telling Joe to get her off the hook.\n\n==Trivia==\n*A running gag is when Margaret scolds John for her distractions, Foo-Foo angrily snarls at him.\n\n{{Fantasia}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Fantasia characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
