He is a well-known intellectual who wants to protect the world from the forces of evil and relies on four incredible intelligent children to aid him.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Personality===\nMr. Benedict is a very eccentric man with very unconventional methods. He is very giddy, yet serious and determined to save the free world at any cost. It is very much apparent that being holed up in his mansion has somewhat affected his social skills and possibly his mental health. He suffers from a severe form of narcolepsy that takes hold of him whenever he is incredibly excited or stressed, though he is only out for a couple of seconds. Despite this, he is very kind and understanding of the children and offers a great deal of good advice to them when necessary. He in some ways has developed a parental fondness for them as he was very concerned for their well being when he sent them out on their own for the first time, yet excited at the prospect of them working together to help save the world.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nMr. Benedict has messy black hair and a beard that has some grey patches in them, He is usually dressed in a nice plaid three piece suit and tie that is usually colored brown or green.\n\n==Role in the [[The Mysterious Benedict Society|series]]==\nNicholas Benedict grew up in an orphanage with his brother, Nathaniel. While Nathaniel was more outgoing and an overachiever, Nicholas was more withdrawn and submissive to his brother's demands. One day, a kind couple came and chose to adopt Nicholas. He promised Nathaniel that once he got cozy in his new life that he would try to convince them to come back and adopt him. However, Nicholas grew to love being an only child and to be able to make his own decisions and when approached with the opportunity to confront his new parents about the second adoption, he choked and acted like nothing was wrong. This small moment had since haunted Nicholas as he realized that his actions lead to Nathaniel's transformation into L.D. Curtain.\n\nBeing a genius in his own right, Nicholas used his intellect to become a success in numerous fields of study. He invented a complex device that revealed that subliminal messages were being sent into people's heads under a phenomena called \"The Emergency\" and managed to follow the source to the L.I.V.E. Institute. Knowing that nobody would believe his theories as people would only see it as proof that one chooses to believe, he set out to form a team to take on this mysterious threat. Over time, he had somehow recruited Number Two, Rhonda Kazembe and the mysterious Milligan as his assistants before setting out to recruit the true agents: children. Using a fake ad for Boatwright Academy, he created a series of tests for children to answer; eventually settling on Reynie Muldoon, Sticky Washington, Kate Wetherall and Constance Contraire.\n\nNicholas and his adult agents watched from afar as the children entered the L.I.V.E. Institute on Harbor Island to take it down from the inside. During their mission, they uncovered Dr. Curtain and sent word of his similarity to Nicholas who was shocked to realize that it was, indeed, his long lost brother. Angered and upset over the news, Nicholas became unnerved and inconsolable. A visit from Ms. Perumal, Reynie's tutor, convinces him that he should end the mission prematurely. However, he is unable to as the children refuse and also his mode of communication is compromised. Following the growing power of Dr. Curtain, Ms. Perumal visits again and informs Nicholas that he should not give up on the children just yet.\n\nAfter building a dirigible, Nicholas and his assistants arrive on Harbor Island to look for the children who are closer to taking down Dr. Curtain's machine the Whisperer which has slowly begun to grow in power. They manage to destroy it just in time for Mr. Benedict to arrive and congratulate the children. He finally confronts his brother and the two of them argue over recent events. Despite his apology, Dr. Curtain tricks Nicholas into laughing himself to sleep and escapes, much to his dismay. Afterwards, Nicholas works out the children's fates; offering to adopt Constance, who turns him down, but decides to be a live-in inhabitant at his mansion, and resumes his work; knowing that his brother may return at any time.\n\n==Trivia==\n* In the original book series, Nicholas Benedict was described as having grey hair, in the series he has dark hair with slight hints of grey, a badly shaved beard and wore glasses. His first name was also not said aloud until the second book. He was also somewhat comically unaware of the fact that he had a twin brother as he was just as surprised when the children told him.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nMr. Benedict poster.jpg\nThe Mysterious Benedict Society Photo 1.jpeg\nThe Mysterious Benedict Society Screenshot 3.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*[[w:c:mysteriousbenedictsociety:Nicholas Benedict|Nicholas Benedict]] at [[w:c:mysteriousbenedictsociety:The_Mysterious_Benedict_Society_Wiki|The Mysterious Benedict Society Wiki]]\n{{The Mysterious Benedict Society}}\n[[Category:The Mysterious Benedict Society]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Professors]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]"
