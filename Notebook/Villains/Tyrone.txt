He is a helpful person but sometimes wants his own way.\n\n===Physical Appearance===\nTyrone looks exactly like Dipper Pines, except that his skin is a bit paler, and doesn't have a blue tree on the front of his hat; instead, ''#2'' is drawn on there in marker.\n==Role in the series==\nTyrone was created by a copier that is able to copy human beings. He was created to help [[Dipper Pines|Dipper]] impress [[Wendy (Gravity Falls)|Wendy]], and was originally named ''#2''. He doesn't want to be called ''#2'' and changes it to Tyrone, which is the name he's always wanted. He then takes care of [[Paper Jam Dipper]], holding him like a baby and trying to feed him a snack. After all the clones turn on Dipper, Dipper fights them to the death and uses a Party Popper to work the fire sprinkler. The rest of the Clones disintegrated when the water got on them, but only Tyrone remains. Dipper and Tyrone fight but then look at Wendy and [[Robbie (Gravity Falls)|Robbie]] hanging out, and they give up and become friends again. Up on the roof with Dipper, they chat and then Tyrone disintegrates from the inside\u00a0when he drinks a can of [[Pitt Cola]]. He makes Dipper promise not to\u00a0act weird around Wendy for him and then disintegrates completely.\n\n==Trivia==\n*For an odd reason, the blue pine tree on Dipper's hat didn't appear on his hat, nor did the bow tie Dipper was wearing at the time, and it did not appear for the other clones either, but the plan somehow appeared in his pocket.\n*His original name was \"#2\", but he was later renamed by Dipper, who had always wanted to be named Tyrone.\n*Tyrone is the only clone to have a name, instead of a number.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\">\ndippertyrone.png|Tyrone with [[Dipper Pines]].\nDipper-Clones-2and3.png|Tyrone with Clon Number 3.\nS1e7 desk window and copier.png\n640px-S1e7 clones lined up.png|Tyrone with [[Dipper Clones]].\nS1e7 dipper and tyrone roof.png\nDipper and tyrone.png\nS1e7 farewell tyrone.png|Tyrone's death.\nDipper and Tyrone 2.png\nDipper and tyrone in attic.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{GFWiki}}\n{{Gravity Falls}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tyrone}}\n[[es:Tyrone]]\n[[nl:Leroy (Gravity Falls)]]\n[[pl:Tyrone]]\n[[Category:Gravity Falls characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Alternate Forms]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Those destroyed]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
