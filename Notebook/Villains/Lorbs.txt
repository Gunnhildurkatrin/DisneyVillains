When Rapunzel, [[Cassandra (Tangled)|Cassandra]], and [[Pascal]] meet the Lorbs on their island, they perceive Pascal as the king from their legend that speaks of Lizardus, as well as away to get rid of the \"monster\" that has been terrorizing their village and hot pepper harvest after seeing his insect appetite, which leads to them welcoming the three to their village and tribe. After their visitors discover the cause of the firefly's \"rage\" and how they can prevent it in the future, the Lorbs thank Pascal and their tall friends for saving their home and solving their problem. After Pascal steps down from being their king, the Lorbs continue to view him and the group of tall strangers as friends.\n\nA flashback of Lorb history was used as the prologue of \"[[Happiness Is...]]\", showing the Lorb warlock, Horb, trying to destroy the [[Idol of Vershaftsbezeigungengien]] while a few consumed Lorbs chased after him for it. Just as Hurb was about to do the deed and the other Lorbs caught up to him the idol was dropped in the chaos, which led to it being lost rather than destroyed. In the present, the Lorbs and Rapunzel's group are having a late night party on the beach, while Rapunzel found a letter from her father in one of their village's collected lanterns and becomes homesick. The next day, she finds the lost idol that she saw as the cure to her homesickness. Pascal observes what the idol's overwhelming power was doing to his friends, he tells his Lorb friends about it; Alfons identifies he was talking about the Idol of Vershaftsbezeigungengien and that it had to be destroyed before it throws the island into chaos. As the tribe tries to get rid of the idol, they too fall victim to the darker side of its power, which leaves the destruction of the idol to Rapunzel, [[Flynn Rider|Eugene]], and Cassandra. After the three destroy it for good, the Lorbs and the rest of the idol's victims are freed from its consuming hold and calm returns to the island.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The Lorbs speak with a German-sounding accent, which ties in with the German setting of ''Tangled''.\n*Alfons, the leader of Lorbs, has a droplet mark on his head to be distinguished from the other Lorbs.\n*The Lorbs physically resemble the [[w:c:zelda:Korok|Koroks]] from [[w:c:zelda:The Legend of Zelda series|''The Legend of Zelda'' series]].\n**They also bare a slight resemblance to the Pistachions (for example [[King Pistachion]]) from \"''[[Milo Murphy's Law]]''\".\n* The Lorbs seem to have very minimal experience with humans, for although they see Rapunzel and her friends as friends of their own, they keep treating humans as pets and cannot tell one human from another. The only exception to both these problems was the [[Captain of the Guards]], and only because they love his mustache.\n* The idol isn't the only source of dark magic on their island. They also have this wishing well (the Fountain of  Unbeaten Gain Faifel) that, as they had learned the hard way, grants any wish exactly as one wants it at first, but then turns even the purest of wishes into terrible living nightmares if the wisher doesn't take the wish back by sunset on the ninth day.  In [[Islands Apart]], the Captain takes advantage of this fountain and ignores Alfons warnings against it.\n* The Lorbs have their own version of the limbo that they call \"schlafen doofen\" which means \"sleeping fool\". Due to their small size, they always win, but that doesn't stop those invited to join the game from trying.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nKing Pascal (6).jpg|The Lorb village\nKing_Pascal_(30).png|The Lorbs' first appearance\nThe_Lorbs_First_Appearance_(as_a_Merged_Figure).jpg\nLorbs_-_King_Pascal.jpg\nKing_Pascal_(31).png\nKing Pascal (33).png\nKing Pascal (9).jpg\nThe_Lorb_chasing_Horb.png\nHorb_about_to_destory_his_own_creation.jpg\nThe_Lorb_chasing_Horb_2.png\nHorb_and_the_other_Lorbs.jpg\nLorb_Party_Music_1.jpg\nLorb_Party_Music_2.jpg\nHappiness Is...
