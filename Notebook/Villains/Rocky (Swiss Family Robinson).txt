After the dogs,\u00a0[[Duke and Turk]], save them from the [[Tiger (Swiss Family Robinson)|tiger]] on the island, [[Mother Robinson|Mother]] allows Francis to keep him, who is later proven very instrumental in helping the Robinsons build their [[Swiss Family Treehouse (Swiss Family Robinson)|treehouse]], and names him Rocky. He, with Francis' new pet monkey on his back, even helps [[Fritz Robinson (Swiss Family Robinson)|Fritz]] and [[Ernst Robinson|Ernst]] pull their [[Sailboat (Swiss Family Robinson)|sailboat]] to the water so as to allow them to find a way off the island.\n\nOn the day of the Robinsons' new holiday, Rocky is one of the animals who participate in the race, with Francis riding him, along with Turk (ridden by Francis' monkey), [[Lightning (Swiss Family Robinson)|Lightning]] the\u00a0donkey (ridden by\u00a0Fritz), [[Clementine (Swiss Family Robinson)|Clementine]]\u00a0the ostrich (ridden by\u00a0Ernst), and [[Duchess (Swiss Family Robinson)|Duchess]]\u00a0the zebra (ridden by\u00a0[[Roberta]]).\n\nIn the end, after the [[Pirates (Swiss Family Robinson)|pirates]]' deaths, and as Ernst travels to [[England]] with Roberta's grandfather, [[Captain Moreland]], to continue his education there, Rocky can be seen running away along with Clementine, Duke, Turk, and Duchess as Francis tries to bring them back.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nSwiss-family-robinson-disneyscreencaps.com-3057.jpg\nSwiss-family-robinson-disneyscreencaps.com-3281.jpg\nSwiss-family-robinson-disneyscreencaps.com-3923.jpg\ntumblr_n3hl4kNJo01qiceiuo1_1280.jpg\nFrancis with Rocky.jpg\nRocky the elephant's first appearance.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Rocky is the real name of the elephant who played him in the movie. According to [[Kevin Corcoran]], who played Francis, he got his name due to the fact that he never stood and rocked back and forth all the time. Corcoran got to be friends with and play with him off camera, and he remembered that he was very friendly to him.\n*It is unknown what happened to Rocky's herd in the movie. An older elephant, which presumably would have been a parent to him, was brought to Tobago for the movie's production, but did not make it into the final film.\n\n{{Swiss Family Robinson}}\n[[Category:Swiss Family Robinson characters]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Elephants]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Infants]]\n[[Category:Kids]]"
