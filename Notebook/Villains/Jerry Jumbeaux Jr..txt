He is the owner of [[Jumbeaux's Caf\u00e9]], an ice cream parlor for elephants and heavy mammals.\n==Role in the film==\nAt Jumbeaux's Cafe, [[Nick Wilde]] enters the restaurant asking Jerry if he can order a [[Jumbo-pop]] for his [[Finnick|son]]. Jerry stubbornly refuses the request on account of the fox's size and species. Just then, [[Judy Hopps]] intervenes and coerces Jerry into giving Nick the popsicle when she threatens to arrest him for health code violations because the parlor staff was not wearing gloved trunks as pointed out by Judy. Not wanting any trouble on his end, Jerry sells Nick the Jumbo-pop, with Judy paying for it.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In an earlier draft of the Jumbo-pop scene, Jerry did not turn Nick and Finnick away due to prejudice, but rather because he understandably assumed that Finnick would be unable to finish such a large treat.<ref>''Zootopia'' Blu-ray and digital deleted scenes: \"Original Jumbo Pop\"</ref>\n*According to his profile in ''[[Zootopia: Crime Files]]'', Jerry is approximately 15 ft. tall and approximately weighs 14,980 lbs.\n*His name could be a reference to [[Dumbo (character)|Dumbo]] as his initial given name, Jumbo Jr.\n*Originally, Jerry's \"We reserve the right to refuse service\" sign was going to say \"No free Jumbo-Pops\".\n\n==Gallery==\n===Concept art===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nArmandSerrano JumbeauxParlor concept2.jpg\nArmandSerrano JumbeauxParlor concept3.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nZootopia At the Ice Cream Parlor.png\nZootopia-disneyscreencaps.com-2219.jpg\nZootopia-easter-eggs-totoro-cookies-frozen-plates.jpg\nZootopia-disneyscreencaps.com-2244.jpg\nZootopia-disneyscreencaps.com-2264.jpg\nZootopia-disneyscreencaps.com-2291.jpeg\nZootopia-disneyscreencaps.com-2281.jpg\nZootopia-disneyscreencaps.com-2322.jpg|\"(Sigh) Fifteen Dollars.\"\n</gallery>\n\n===Merchandise===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nModal tsum-tsum zootopia 20160105.jpg\nZootopia tote .jpg\nNick Wilde Finnick Jerry Figures.jpg\nJerry Flatsie Plush.jpg\nZootopia Funko Pops and Mystery Minis.jpg\nJerry Jumbeaux Jr Tsum Tsum Mini.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Misc.===\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nZootopia Art Department Emblem.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Zootopia}}\n{{DisneyTsumTsum}}\n{{Disney Crossy Road}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jumbeaux Jr., Jerry}}\n[[ar:\u062c\u064a\u0631\u064a \u062c\u0627\u0645\u0628\u0648]]\n[[de:Jerry Jumbeaux Jr.]]\n[[es:Jerry Jumbeaux Jr.]]\n[[fr:Jerry Jumbeaux Jr.]]\n[[pt-br:Jerry Jumbo Jr.]]\n[[Category:Zootopia characters]]\n[[Category:Elephants]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney Crossy Road characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]"
