He is eventually bought, being separated from her, and tries to find her throughout the majority of the segment. At the end, after being tossed away, smacked around, and left in a condition that was a far cry from his original pristine days, he is picked up by an iceman who cuts two holes in his rim to fit him over his horse's ears - the horse beside him wearing a similarly changed Alice! Thus they are reunited and go on to be together ever after. Johnny made a cameo during the final scene of ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' atop the head of a cartoon hippopotamus.\n\n==Gallery==\n\n===Animation===\n<gallery widths=\"130\" position=\"center\">\nJhonny Fedora.jpg\nAlice.jphjks.jpg|Johnny smiling at Alice\nMakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps com-4311.jpg|Johnny and Alice's first kiss at the store\nmake-mine-music-disneyscreencaps.com-4703.jpg|Johnny singing to Alice\nMakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps com-4329.jpg|Johnny and Alice's dream sequence about their future baby bonnets\nMakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps com-4409.jpg|Johnny seeing Alice being bought by a woman\nMakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps com-4455.jpg|Johnny crying\nMakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps com-4471.jpg|Johnny being bought by a man\nmake-mine-music-disneyscreencaps.com-4893.jpg|Johnny being tried on by the man\nMakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps com-4525.jpg|Johnny talking to strangers\nMakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps com-4644.jpg|Johnny getting blown away from his owner while seeing Alice\n42209.jpg|Johnny smacking into a billboard\nmake-mine-music-disneyscreencaps.com-5074.jpg|Johnny nearly getting run over by a bicycle\nmake-mine-music-disneyscreencaps.com-5076.jpg|...a streetcar\nmake-mine-music-disneyscreencaps.com-5093.jpg|...and a car\nMakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps com-4680.jpg|Johnny  getting bitten by two dogs\n1954-bonnetbleu-3.jpg|Johnny being discovered by a dilapidated man\nmake-mine-music-disneyscreencaps.com-5139.jpg|Johnny sadly contemplating his fate after his new owner walks into a bar\n42210.jpg|Johnny uninterested in a pretty pink hat who gives him looks at the bar\nMakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps com-4739.jpg|Johnny fighting at the bar\nMakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps com-4815.jpg|Johnny freezing his brim off\nmake-mine-music-disneyscreencaps.com-5235.jpg|Johnny returning to the store to see if Alice is there\n42211.jpg|Johnny observing some wedding apparel in the store window\nMakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps com-4842.jpg|Johnny getting swept off the sidewalk with the rest of the garbage\nMakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps com-4849.jpg|Johnny flat as a pancake when literally crushed\n42212.jpg|Johnny caught in the stream of water from a street sweeper\nMakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps com-4898.jpg|Johnny almost ending up in the sewer\n42213.jpg|Johnny saddened when placed upon the horse's head\n42214.jpg|Johnny happily reunited with Alice\nTumblr myja2fuRMk1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\nMakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps com-4988.jpg|Johnny and Alice kissing again in the horses' stable\nAlice blue .jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Printed Media===\n<gallery widths=\"130\" position=\"center\">\nAlice 1.jpg\nMakeMineMusicPoster.jpg\nMakeMineMusicPoster (2).jpg\nJohnnyFedora&amp;AliceBluebonnetLobbyCard.jpg|Johnny and Alice on a lobby card for [[Make Mine Music]]\nJohnnyFedora&AliceBluebonnetStorybook (1).jpg|Johnny and Alice in the Disneyland Read-Along Storybook\nJohnnyFedora&AliceBluebonnetStorybook (3).jpg\nJohnnyFedoraStorybook (2).jpg\nJohnnyFedoraStorybook (5).jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Merchandise and Miscellaneous===\n<gallery widths=\"130\" position=\"center\">\nAlice blue.jpg\nDisney-Mix6.jpeg\nclub11.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fedora, Johnny}}\n\n{{Make Mine Music}}\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Make Mine Music characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Articles of Clothing]]\n[[Category:Who Framed Roger Rabbit cameos]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse (TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
