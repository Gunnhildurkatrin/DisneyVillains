Accusing her of being a serpent, the mother bird attacks Alice and she quickly acts to shrink herself with another mushroom piece. As she did, the bird managed to grab her eggs and make sure they're safe before getting one last good look at where Alice was.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The mother bird's animation was later reused for that of the Toucan's in Goliath II.\n*In one Alice in Wonderland comic, when the mother bird came to tell the Dodo (who was with Alice) about what was going on in the [[Tulgey Wood]], she hardly seemed to mind Alice (if she even noticed her at all), possibly due to her size.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" orientation=\"none\">\nalice1951-bluray-05.jpg|Mother Bird on a giant Alice's nose\nAlice_in_Wonderland_Party_Crashers.jpg|Mother Birds size compared to a giant Alice\nTumblr mhmuu4LN9I1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Alice in Wonderland}}\n[[Category:Alice in Wonderland characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Passeriformes]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
