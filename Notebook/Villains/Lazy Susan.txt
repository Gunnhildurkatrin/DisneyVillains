She is a woman who lives in [[Gravity Falls (location)|Gravity Falls, Oregon]] and is known for being lazy and not wanting to do things. For example, while fishing, she simply asked for the fish to get into the pan instead of catching the fish herself.\n\n==Role in the series==\n===Season 1===\nIn \"[[Tourist Trapped]]\", she appears as a waitress writing down an order, while Norman breaks the glass of the door to open it.\n\nIn \"[[The Legend of the Gobblewonker]]\", she appears asking the fish to get in her pan.\n\nIn \"[[Dipper vs. Manliness]]\", [[Mabel Pines|Mabel]] helps [[Stan Pines|Stan]] get her attracted to him.\n\nIn \"[[Irrational Treasure]]\", Lazy Susan is seen riding in a wagon with Lake Gravity Falls Ranger McGucket during Pioneer Day. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nIn \"[[Little Dipper]]\", she is seen sitting by the bus stop with [[Li'l Gideon]]. She attempts to make a friendly conversation, but is quickly freaked out by Gideon's rant about revenge and doesn't get on the bus when it comes.\u00a0\n\nIn \"[[Summerween]]\", she appears dressed as a big ball of yarn with her cats climbing all over it, giving huge amounts of candy to Trick-or-Treaters. She only gives one piece of candy each to Mabel, [[Soos Ramirez|Soos]], [[Candy Chiu]], and [[Grenda]] because Dipper was not wearing a costume.\n\nIn \"[[Dreamscaperers+Gideon Rises|Gideon Rises]]\", she was one of the citizens that believed Lil' Gideon to be psychic. In her case, Susan thought that he knew her secret about coffee pancakes, but in the end, it was proven by Grunkle Stan that Lil' Gideon only knew it by using a hidden camera.\n\n===Season 2===\nIn \"[[Scary-oke]]\", she attends the \"Mystery Shack is Back\" party, bringing a pie with her. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n==Personality==\nLazy Susan is, as her name implies, is sluggish and avoids hard work. She has a rather odd sense of humor and enjoys fixing things, although she is untalented at doing so. She loves cats and owns three. She is extremely codependent in her love life, as exhibited by her incessant calls to Grunkle Stan in their short-lived relationship. Lazy Susan is also rather oblivious. She is also friendly and polite.\n\n==Trivia==\n*She may take the \"''Lazy Susan''\" cause of her lazy left eye, whose lid droops completely down in a perpetual wink and being referenced lazy as of from a revolving table-top.\n\n{{GFWiki}}\n{{Gravity Falls}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Susan, Lazy}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Gravity Falls characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
