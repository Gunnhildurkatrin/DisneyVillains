He is the father of [[Beshte]] (the strongest in the [[Pride Lands]]) and the leader of the [[Basi's Pod|Hippo Pod]] in the [[Pride Lands]].\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nMuch like his son, Basi is a gentle giant with an optimistic disposition. Basi is amicable and open, willing to engage in conversation and negotiate according to the customs of his homeland. Being so learned in the ways of the animals, Basi is knowledgeable and wise. Despite being an animal with a very different way of life, he understands the customs of the crocodiles and how this affects his pod's everyday life. Basi is also shown as an encouraging influence on his son, his son often quoting motivational and helpful quotes from Basi.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nBasi is the largest hippo in his pod. As a hippo, he is massively portly and well-built. He has hairs on his muzzle and notices in his ears. He has dark brownish-gray skin, a pale underbelly, dark spots on his back, and dark rims around his eyes. He also has bucked teeth and small ears.\n\n==Role in the series==\n===[[The Rise of Makuu|''The Rise of Makuu'']]===\n{{Quote|And when there's too many fish in the lake, the crocodiles come and eat the fish. It's the Circle of Life at its finest.|Basi on Big Spring's fish}}\nBasi is first seen when Beshte brings his friends to Big Springs, since [[Ono]] is worried on Bunga's smell, with Beshte explaining that the fish eat all of the food in his teeth, cleaning him, with Basi adding when there are too many fish in the lake, the crocodiles come and balance the amount of fish.\n\nIn the midst of their talk, [[Pua (The Lion Guard)|Pua]], the leader of the crocodiles, approaches and asks Basi how the fish are faring. Basi suggests that the float come back next week, and Pua amicably agrees, leading his crocodiles away. However, before he can leave, he is challenged by [[Makuu]], who accuses him of being afraid of Basi and weak for not ignoring a hippo's word. The two arrange a mashindano at Lake Matope, which Basi explains as being a physical contest that determines the leader of the crocodiles.\n\nWhen the mashindano takes place, Basi watches alongside his son, Beshte. At the start of the event, Basi can be seen chanting, and in the midst of the brawl, he comments that Pua is too tired and weak to take on Makuu. Not long after this comment, Makuu wins, and Basi explains that as a defeated leader, Pua is banished from the crocodile float, however that causes Makuu to take Big Springs from [[Basi's Pod]], leading to all of the [[Pride Animals]] not being in their natural homes (Basi forced to take the Elephants' Spring).\n\nBasi makes his final appearance when the Circle of Life is brought back into balance, with the crocodiles returning Big Springs to the hippopotamuses. As Makuu strides sullenly out of the water, Basi calls out after him, inviting him to come back once the fish are in plenty. He reminds him that all he has to do is ask, and Makuu promises to keep the proposition in mind.\n\n===[[The Kupatana Celebration|''The Kupatana Celebration'']]===\nBasi is first seen during the opening scene where he is alongside [[Twiga]], [[Mbuni]], [[Muhanga and Muhangus|Muhanga]] rehearsing for their song in the upcoming Kupatana Celebration, though Mbuni makes a mistake. From a distance, their singing can be heard, with [[Simba]] complimenting Basi's singing to Beshte, much to his enjoyment.\n\nLater on, he is seen at the celebration, where he alongside the others, is seen singing the song they were rehearsing that day, though afterwards comes a jackal attack, where he is seen glaring down at [[Dogo]] and his [[Dogo's Brothers|siblings]].\n\n===[[Bunga and the King]]===\nBeshte mentions his father after seeing Bunga ride on Simba as the pair leap through the chasm. He quotes his father as always saying, ''Live long enough, and you'll see everything''.\n\n===[[The Trouble With Galagos]]===\nBasi is mentioned when Beshte sees Shingo stuck in a tree. He quotes his father by saying ''Like my dad says, 'Live long enough, and you'll see everything'''.\n\n===[[Beshte and the Hippo Lanes]]===\nBasi and his son Beshte are in the Flood Plains, walking through the reeds and stomping them down. Basi explains to his son how making the Hippo Lanes after a big rainstorm has been a hippo tradition for a long time. He goes on to say that the lanes help others cross the Flood Plains, and that a good Hippo Lane must be \"straight and true\" and that someday, it will be Beshte's turn to make the lanes.\n\nSuddenly, a voice calls out for help. The pair rush towards the sound of the voice and locate Young Rhino, who is trapped in the reeds. Nearby, Makuu and another crocodile are lurking, positive they won't find him in the mess. However, Beshte bursts through the reeds and warns him to back off, reminding him that the Flood Plains are a safe spot after a rainstorm. Makuu challenges Beshte, believing him to be outnumbered. Basi soon arrives and chastises him, and Makuu slinks away, muttering angrily that hippos always follow the rules.\n\nConfirming they're gone, Young Rhino explains how he was trying to cross when he became ensnarled in the reeds and mud. Basi comments that he should have waited, but Young Rhino claims that he was in a hurry, but soon admits that he should have waited. Basi and Beshte start to untangle him, but a flock of egrets startles him greatly, and he accidentally thrusts his horn against Basi's leg. Young Rhino is freed regardless, and he thanks them, promising that he'll wait. Basi assures him that it won't be long.\n\n=== [[Beshte and the Beast|Beshte and the Beast]] ===\nBasi's pod is fighting with the [[Army of Scar]] when [[Shujaa]] comes to help.\n\n=== [[The Fall of Mizimu Grove|The Fall of Mizimu Grove]] ===\nBasi gets worried when he sees something in the water turns out it's just a baby hippo. [[Makini]] comes by to talk about her Mpando Mpaya. She invites Basi's Pod but Kion turns it into a huge event. At the celebration, the Army of Scar crashes the party. The [[Pride Animals|Pride Landers]] and [[Outlanders]] have a battle and Scar reveals himself. He explains his plan and everyone starts to run away. Once calmed Basi starts to wonder why Kion never told them about Scar being back. Simba claims that the [[Lion Guard]] was following his orders. The herds all think they should leave the Pride Lands. The next morning they all meet at [[Pride Rock]] and Kion comes with an announcement. Turns out Makini's tree has survived the battle. Basi admits he'll stay since they're stronger together and Makini plants her tree.\n\n=== [[Return to the Pride Lands]] ===\nBasi comes to Pride Rock after hearing that the Lion Guard is back and reunites with Beshte. He then takes his son home to Big Springs where Beshte is given a big welcome home by their pod, the crocs, and the elephants. He also watches the competition between Kion and [[Vitani]]'s Lion Guards. When his son joins the [[Night Pride]], Basi is among the attendees at Kion's wedding/coronation.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nHipposatBigSprings.png|Basi with the Lion Guard at Big Springs\nRom- (114).png|Basi tells Pua to come back next week\nMashindano (93).png|Basi explains the fight rules\nTromakuu- (259).png|Inviting Makuu back later\nTromakuu- (257).png|Returning to normal\nTromakuu- (258).png|Returning to normal\nThe-kupatana-celebration-hd (5).png|Basi sings\nThe-kupatana-celebration-hd (4).png|Basi sings along with the other Pride Landers\nBeshte-and-the-hippo-lanes (3).png|Making Hippo Lanes\nLG.
