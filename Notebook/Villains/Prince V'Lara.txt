Without it, V'Lara was transformed into a feeble and weak man by Gargon.\n\nV'Lara first met [[Wildwing Flashblade|Wildwing]] when he too was imprisoned in the very same dungeon. He managed to free them both, and returned V'Lara's scepter to him. In true royal fashion, the prince then thanked Wildwing before he departed to pursue a fleeing [[Saurians|Saurian]].\n\n==Memorable Quotes==\n* '''[[The Final Face-Off]]''': \"You can do it, feathered friend, no matter what it takes.\"\n\n==Trivia==\n* Prince V'Lara speaks in a manner similar to [[Elvis Presley]], possibly in reference to Presley's title as the \"King of Rock and Roll\". He also has a similar haircut.\n\n{{The Mighty Ducks}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:V'Lara, Prince}}\n[[Category:Mighty Ducks (TV show) characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Princes]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]"
