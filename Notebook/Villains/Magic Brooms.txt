They are the primary antagonists in \"[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]\" segment.\n\n==Background==\n===\ufeffDesigns===\nThe brooms are besom brooms with brown handles and yellow bristles. They have been animated by magic, and have sprouted thin, brown arms and four-fingered hands as a result. Their bristles are their \"legs\". The brooms are constantly seen carrying one brown bucket of water in each hand. Each bucket has a silver handle and two silver hoops around them.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]''===\nIn the short, one\u00a0broom\u00a0is brought to life by [[Mickey Mouse]]. He had done the spell in order for the broom to do his work, instead. The plan goes by smoothly until Mickey falls asleep and wakes up hours later once the building is flooded. Mickey tries to stop the broom but it does not work. Mickey then grabs an ax and chops the broom into pieces. From the two halves, as well as the scattered splinters, an entire army of water-carrying brooms arises, and the entire room is soon filled with water. Eventually, Mickey's mentor [[Yen Sid]] comes and ends the chaos.\n\n===''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''===\nThe brooms made a cameo appearance in the film, sweeping at the [[Maroon Cartoons|Maroon Cartoons Studio]] while a man plays \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" on a saxophone.\n\n===''[[Darkwing Duck]]''===\nTwo brooms made a cameo appearance in the ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'' episode \"[[Hot Spells]]\". When they appear, Beezelebub is peeved that they don't clean windows.\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\nIn the television series ''[[House of Mouse]]'', the brooms make cameos along with many other Disney characters. In the show, the brooms work at the club as its janitors as well as its means of extinguishing fires and are frequently seen sweeping with modern brooms as a joke. In the episode \"[[Donald's Lamp Trade]]\", one of the brooms (taking a role similar to [[Magic Carpet]] when he follows [[Aladdin (character)|Aladdin]] in the [[Cave of Wonders]]) follows Donald and they end up walling off of [[Pride Rock]] and go flying.\n\n===''[[Tangled]]''===\nA Magic Broom made a cameo appearance as a regular broom at the Town Square.\n\n===''[[Kingdom Keepers]]''===\nIn ''[[Kingdom Keepers II: Disney at Dawn]]'', the Broomsticks follow Finn around Hollywood Studios. In ''[[Kingdom Keepers V: Shell Game]]'', they attack the DHI base with buckets of acid but are thwarted by [[Charlene Turner]].\n\n=== ''[[Once Upon a Time]]'' ===\nIn ''Once Upon a Time'', the magic broom\u00a0is an enchanted, walking broomstick that [[Rumplestiltskin]]\u00a0used in order to find the\u00a0[[The Apprentice (character)|Sorcerer's Apprentice]]\u00a0in the town of\u00a0[[Storybrooke]].\n\n==Video games==\n===''[[Mickey Mousecapade]]''===\nThe Brooms appear as enemies in this game.\n\n===''[[Fantasia (video game)|Fantasia]]''===\nThe Brooms appear as enemies in this game as well.\n\n===''[[Disney's Aladdin in Nasira's Revenge]]''===\nThe Brooms also appear as enemies in this game first encountered in the Palace levels usually in the slippery ice parts.\n\n===[[Kingdom Hearts (series)|''Kingdom Hearts'' series]]===\n[[File:Magic_Broom_KH3D.png|right|250px]]\nThe Brooms appear in both ''[[Kingdom Hearts (game)|Kingdom Hearts]]'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'' as housekeepers (and occasionally guards) of [[Disney Castle]]. As before, the Brooms are silent, but it is because they are so busy that they never talk to Sora and company. In\u00a0''[[Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep]]'', the Brooms arrest and remove [[Pete]] at [[Minnie Mouse|Queen Minnie]]'s command. They also appear in ''[[Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance]]'' in Symphony of Sorcery, and play a role similar to their appearance in ''Fantasia''.\n\n===''[[Epic Mickey]]''===\nThe brooms appear in the ''Fantasia''-based transition stages and in the ending credits animation chasing a Blotling. They also serve as the inspiration for the [[Sweepers|Sweeper Blotlings]]. A lifeless broom can be seen in Yen Sid's studies during the opening. The Magic Brooms reappear in the sequel, ''[[Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two]]''.\n\n===''[[Disney Infinity]]''===\nThe Magic Brooms appear in ''Disney Infinity'' as enemies, however, several seem to aid Sorcerer Mickey as one of his attacks. In the 3DS version, they appear as cameos on the game board moving space turning them into coin spaces.\n\n==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==\n[[File:2903836190 e5ba97ee71 b.jpg|thumb|250px|The brooms at Walt Disney World.]]\n===[[Walt Disney World]]===\nThey were seen along with Mickey Mouse's float in the ''[[Celebrate A Dreams Come True Parade]]'' at the [[Magic Kingdom]].\n\nThe brooms also have topiaries at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]].\n\nIn ''[[Mickey's PhilharMagic]]'', when Donald accidentally loses the sorcerer hat, he journeys off into different Disney films including Fantasia where the brooms splash the water in the buckets onto Donald eventually leading him to ''[[The Little Mermaid]]''. This attraction also shows 2 exclusive broom variations: a tiny broom with a single normal-sized bucket (which Donald took so the broom wouldn't splash him), and an enormous broom with a single and equally giant bucket (which it used to flood over Donald after it got him to return the tiny broom's bucket).\n\nIn [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]]' version of ''[[Fantasmic!]]'', the brooms make minor cameos during the floating bubble sequence.\n\n===[[Tokyo Disney Resort]]===\nIn [[Tokyo DisneySea]]'s version of ''Fantasmic!'', they appear marching on the Sorcerer's Hat stage during the Sorcerer's Apprentice sequence opening the show.\n\nThey also appeared at [[Remember... Dreams Come True|Celebrate! Tokyo Disneyland]] opening scene before Mickey takes the balcony on the [[Cinderella Castle]] in shadow note.\n\n===[[Shanghai Disneyland]]===\nMulticolored variants of the Magic Brooms appear in the ''Fantasia'' scene of ''[[Voyage to the Crystal Grotto]]'', dumping water on Sorcerer Mickey.\n\n==Other appearances==\n*[[Genie]] from [[Aladdin (1992 film)|Aladdin]] impersonated one of the brooms (though still retaining his face) in the [[Aladdin (TV series)|tv series spin-off]].\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n{{Fantasia}}\n{{Mickey Mouse & Friends}}\n{{House of Mouse}}\n{{Kingdom Hearts}}\n{{Epic Mickey}}\n{{Kingdom Keepers}}\n{{Once Upon a Time}}\n\n[[es:Las Escobas]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Fantasia characters]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Fantasmic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Who Framed Roger Rabbit cameos]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Epic Mickey characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Disney on Ice characters]]\n[[Category:Servants]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Magical Objects]]\n[[Category:Overtakers]]\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Created by Magic]]\n[[Category:The Sorcerer's Apprentice characters]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Keepers characters]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Infinity characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Dreams! characters]]\n[[Category:Custodians]]\n[[Category:Darkwing Duck characters]]\n[[Category:Armies]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Spell Cards characters]]\n[[Category:Once Upon a Time characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey's Philharmagic characters]]\n[[Category:Once Upon a Time objects]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Animated characters in live-action films]]\n[[Category:Bonkers characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Magic Kingdoms characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Descendants characters]]\n[[Category:Wonderful World of Color]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Sorcerer's Arena Characters]]"
