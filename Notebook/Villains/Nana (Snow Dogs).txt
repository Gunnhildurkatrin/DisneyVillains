She quickly latched onto Ted, perhaps his scent reminded her of her late mistress, Lucy. She quickly became Ted's favorite, enjoying getting to ride in the car as the rest of the dogs had to pull the car down the street. Even though she wasn't a Siberian Husky, she wanted to join the team, but wasn't given the chance until Ted needed her to be lead dog in his rescue effort. When she and the team were returning home with their mushers, the sled slipped off the cliff. Working with Demon, the team managed to save the sled and mushers, bringing them to safety. Her efforts impressed Demon, who later \"married\" her and had four puppies together.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"175\">\nChar 63698.jpg|Nana begging for food from Ted\nBanner 958.jpg|Talking Nana and the other talking dogs at the beach in Ted's crazy dream\nDemon-snow-dogs-32163393-632-480.png|Nana and the dogs at Ted and Barb's Alaskan wedding\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Nana is the only one of Lucy's dogs not to be a Siberian Husky.\n*Nana is the only dog who seems to like Ted mostly.\n*Nana is the first non-Siberian Husky character to become a lead dog in the movie.\n*Nana is the only dog that kept Lucy company during the days when Lucy was not out sleding.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n<br clear=\"all\"/>\n{{Snow Dogs}}\n[[Category:Snow Dogs characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]"
