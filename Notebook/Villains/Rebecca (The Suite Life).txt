"{{Infobox character\n|name=Rebecca\n|image=Victoria_justice13.jpg\n|shows=''[[The Suite Life of Zack & Cody]]''\n|actor=[[Victoria Justice]]\n}}'''Rebecca''' ([[Victoria Justice]]) is a character in ''[[The Suite Life of Zack & Cody]]''. She only appears in \"[[The Fairest of Them All (The Suite Life episode)|The Fairest of Them All]]\" and gives [[Cody Martin|Cody]] his first kiss.\n\n==Story==\nRebecca is first seen in the hotel lobby. It seems that when her eyes meet with Cody's, she likes him, but still refuses to let him help her with her bag, saying she \"can't talk to strangers.\"\n\nShe really likes Tyreesha (Cody), and whenever Cody compliments her says she (he) is \"so sweet.\" She has also called him funny and tried to hug him, but could not because Zack did instead, excited with the prospect of earning money for bikes.\n\nShe only competes in beauty pageants because she needs money for vet school, as she wants to open an animal hospital for underprivileged pets. Her mother is never seen, but in the first part of the episode Rebecca has to go hold her earrings because her mother got in a catfight.\n\nRebecca wins the beauty pageant because Cody drops out and is disqualified anyways because the judges discover Tyreesha ([[Zack Martin|Zack]] in the talent competition, as he had dropped out) is a boy. In the last scene of the episode, she warms up to him and says goodbye, kissing him. After she leaves Cody declares that that was \"way better than a bike!\"\n\n{{Suite Life}}\n[[Category:The Suite Life characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Stude]]\n[[Category:Students]]"
