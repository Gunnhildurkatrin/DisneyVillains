He plays a supportive role in Mickey Mouse's comic book mysteries as a police officer who often relies on Mickey's help to catch characters such as [[Pete]], [[Phantom Blot]] and the like. Known fellow officers include his friend, [[Detective Casey]].\n\n==History==\nThe character was conceived by [[Floyd Gottfredson]] (and Merrill De Maris) for Disney as a stereotypical Irish cop. He first appeared in the newspaper strips in May 1939, in the serial \"Mickey Mouse Outwits the Phantom Blot\". In the German translations of the comics, he is known as \"Kommissar Albert Hunter\" (Kommissar means commissioner in German), in the Italian version as \"Commissario Adamo Basettoni\" (\"comissario\" is the Italian for \"commissioner\", \"Basettoni\" is a reference to O'Hara's sideburns), and in the Portuguese and Brazilian versions as \"Coronel Cintra\".\n\nIn 1995 Italian authors Giorgio Pezzin and [[Romano Scarpa]] created the character of Petulia as O'Hara's wife.\n\n==Animation==\n===''[[DuckTales]]''===\nO'Hara's first appearance in animation is in the animated TV series ''DuckTales''. O'Hara made occasional appearances in various episodes of the series, including \"[[Ducky Horror Picture Show]]\" and \"[[The Bride Wore Stripes]]\".\n\n===''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]''===\nO'Hara would later go on to be a supporting character in ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]''. In ''Mouse Works'', O'Hara would occasionally show up to arrest the villains that Mickey has defeated, such as [[Pete]] after trying to steal Minnie's purse, Mortimer after it was revealed that the baseball belongs to Mickey (which Mortimer uses it to trick Mickey out of a dinner date with Minnie) and Minnie when she drove into Daisy's house as an attempt to give her a most famous apple pie that she just made. In ''[[Mickey Foils the Phantom Blot]]'', O'Hara awarded Mickey, Donald and Goofy medals for saving the city from the blot.\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\nO'Hara also made a special appearance on ''[[House of Mouse]]'' in the episode \"[[House of Crime]]\", where he visited the club to investigate the mysterious guest disappearances. It was soon revealed that the [[Phantom Blot]] was behind the thefts, and together Mickey and O'Hara defeated the villain. Later on, he arrested [[Ludwig Von Drake]] for creating a cartoon that he said had him dying of laughter.\n\n==Trivia==\n* He shares the same name as the [[w:c:batman:Chief O'Hara|character]] in the 1966 ''Batman'' series. Only his first name is Miles (revealed in the 2016 animated film ''[[w:c:dcmovies:Batman:_Return_of_the_Caped_Crusaders|Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders]]''), while he's been called Clancy in nearly every other continuities.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nChief O'Hara House of Mouse.jpg|Chief O'Hara with Mickey in House of Mouse.\nO'Harahom.png|Chief O'Hara in ''Mickey Mouse Works''.\nFourcolor16b.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Mickey Mouse & Friends}}\n{{Disney Crossy Road}}\n{{DuckTales}}\n{{House of Mouse}}\n{{Mickey Mouse Works}}\n[[da:Politimester Striks (karakter)]]\n[[es:El Jefe O'Hara]]\n[[fr:Commissaire Finot]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Police officers]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Irish characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse Works characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:DuckTales characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Crossy Road characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]"
