Peppington''' is a character in the [[DuckTales (2017 series)|''DuckTales'' reboot]].\n\n==Background==\nPercival is described as the creator of the drink [[Pep!|PEP]]; however, in his first appearance, he is shown to have an unnamed, mentioned son. [[Doofus Drake]] felt enraged for hiring a grown-up to play his son to which Percival fearfully regrets on hiring his real son in his car.\n\n==Role in the series==\nPercival P. Peppington first appeared in the Season 2 episode, ''[[Happy Birthday, Doofus Drake!]]\".''\n\nWhen [[Goldie]] takes [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|Louie]] to the carnival at the tree house doing a con artist plan, Percival attends [[Doofus Drake]]'s birthday party where Doofus blames him for hiring a grown-up actor pretending to be his son and demands him to hire a child actor to pretend to be his son. Just as Percival prepares to get his real son in his car, Doofus presses a switch that causes him to fall into a storage of honeybees, much to Doofus being unhappy for many liars in his party.\n\nIn \"[[Louie's Eleven!]]\", Percival can be seen briefly kicked out of the museum for supposedly attempting to crash the party. He later leaves in anger.\n\n==Trivia==\n* His design appears to be based on that of Gene Wilder's portrayal of Willy Wonka in the 1971 musical fantasy film, ''Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory'', especially the cartoony depiction of him in the Wonka candy commercials and the design of Willy Wonka in the Wonka candy brand (now Nestl\u00e9 Candy Shop).\n\n{{DuckTales}}\n[[Category:DuckTales characters]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
