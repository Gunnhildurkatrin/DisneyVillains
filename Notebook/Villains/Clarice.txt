Her beauty and talent catches the interests of both Chip and Dale, who proceeded to compete for her affections - the first time Chip and Dale have ever worked against each other. Despite the short going on to become one of Chip and Dale's most beloved, Clarice would not appear in any future animation (sans in archived footage of the short when played on ''[[Walt Disney anthology series]]'' and ''[[House of Mouse]]'') for 69 years until reappearing in the 2021 [[Disney+]] series [[Chip 'n' Dale: Park Life|Chip n Dale Park Life]]. Regardless, the trope of Chip and Dale competing for the affections of an attractive female would become somewhat of a staple, specifically in ''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]''.\n\nWhile Chip and Dale have been at the Disney theme parks since 1955, Clarice was present during [[Disneyland]]\u2019s opening ceremony on [[July 17]], [[1955]] and was a meetable character throughout the 1950s. She eventually disappeared from the parks in [[1961]]. She later returned to the parks in [[2005]] and was exclusively found at the [[Tokyo Disney Resort]], where she's very prominent. Clarice later started appearing at the [[Walt Disney World Resort]] and the [[Disneyland Resort]] in Spring [[2009]]. She eventually became prominent at [[Disneyland Paris]] in the early 2010s and at [[Hong Kong Disneyland]].\n\nIn Japan, Clarice has been regularly featured in media and merchandise involving the ''Mickey Mouse'' franchise. She would often feature as the definitive love interest of both Chip and Dale (in the same vein as what [[Minnie Mouse]] is to [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]], and [[Daisy Duck]] is to [[Donald Duck|Donald]]). An example of this is the [http://www.unibearsity.jp/ ''Disney UniBEARsity''] spin-off franchise. Clarice appears in the story ''[http://www.youtube.com/watch?&v=eUBK6rTtzjQ Two Bears and a Kiss]'', in which she was responsible for providing Chip and Dale the materials to make their teddy bears.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Chip 'n' Dale: Park Life]]''===\nClarice appears in the animated series, marking her first proper appearance in animation since her debut short in 1952.<ref name=\"chip\"/>\n\n[[File:Clarice in Chip 'n' Dale- Park Life.jpg|thumb|250px|Clarice in ''[[Chip 'n' Dale: Park Life]].'']]Her character undergoes a radical redesign with a tomboyish look. Clarice has no clothes and instead possesses an undercut with two flowers shaved into the sides of her head, as a nod to her classic look. She also has her own set of buck teeth that are held together like Chip's, but are slightly uneven with one tooth being longer than the other.\n\nClarice is much more well-off than her previous incarnation and is constantly putting up with Chip and Dale's ineptitude, though she will help them out if necessary. Unlike Chip and Dale, who live in a tree, Clarice lives in a car engine that somehow ended up in a tree. She is a messy, almost barbaric, person, yet is also very constructive chipmunk who is constantly tinkering and fixing things. Her relationship to the boys is also more platonic, though they do admire her for her respective abilities.\n\n==Video games==\n===''[[Disney Tsum Tsum (game)|Disney Tsum Tsum]]''===\nClarice is a Premium box Tsum Tsum, with the ability to turn the central characters into heart-eyed Chip and Dale Tsum Tsums. These can be connected to Clarice's for points.\n\n===''[[Disney Magical World 2]]''===\n[[File:DMW2 - Clarice.jpg|thumb|250px|Clarice in ''[[Disney Magical World 2]].'']]In the simulation game, Clarice is a resident of Castleton alongside other classic Disney characters. She is associated with Daisy and owns a style shop in which she can take the player's current attire and create variations with different colors and styles.\n\n===''[[Kingdom Hearts Union \u03c7]]''===\nIn the mobile game ''Kingdom Hearts Unchained X'', a beret or snuggly accessory of Clarice can be equipped on the avatar.\n\n==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==\n[[File:8643690043 4e7f849420 b.jpg|thumb|250px|Clarice at Disneyland Paris.]]\nClarice made her first live appearance at [[Disneyland]] in [[1955]]. Nowadays, she rarely appears in the North American parks, her most recent appearance being during the reopening ceremony of the [[Disneyland Railroad]]\u00a0on July 28, 2017, but is extremely common at the [[Tokyo Disney Resort]], as she is a widely popular character amongst Japanese audiences.\n\n===[[Tokyo Disney Resort]]===\nClarice and has been seen in the parks since 2005.\n\nAt [[Tokyo Disneyland]], she is prominently featured in [[Nightfall Glow]], where she speaks English in a Disney theme park for the first time.\n\nAt [[Tokyo DisneySea]], she appears in the finale of [[Fantasmic!]] and the Easter in New York show for [[Mickey & Duffy's Spring Voyage]] to celebrate the arrival of spring.\n\n===[[Disneyland Paris]]===\nBesides appearing for meet-and-greets often, Clarice was part of the Halloween shows, Captain Mickey and the Pumpkin Pirates and Merlin and the Witch Academy.\n\n=== [[Disneyland Paris|Disneyland]]  ===\nClarice returned to the Disneyland Resort in 2009 after a 50 year absence for the street show \"Celebrate! A Street Party\". She makes occasional at the resort for special events and occasionally parties. She was present at the \"Dancing With Disney\" dance party located at Disney's California Adventures between 2010-2014. She also makes occasional meet and greets at Disneyland.\n\n===[[Walt Disney World]]===\nClarice made her debut at Walt Disney World on April 12, 2009 on Easter at Disney's Polynesian Resort where she meet guests alongside Mr. Easter Bunny. During that period, Clarice was meetable at Disney's Hollywood Studios around the Sorcerer Mickey Hat and One's Man Dream. In 2019, Clarice made a rare stateside appearance alongside Chip 'n' Dale for a character greeting during the [[RunDisney]] Walt Disney World Marathon.\n\nOn January 2019, she began to appear in the [[Move It! Shake It! MousekeDance It! Street Party]].\n\n=== Shanghai Disneyland ===\nAside from appearing in various merchandise, she made her Shanghai debut in the park during the first Chip 'n Dale event beginning on November 8, 2021.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Though she is the same as Chip and Dale in that her fur is brown, some Japanese promotional art gives her fur a more yellowish tone.\n*Back when Disney Characters appeared at the Ice Capades shows held in 1955 which were later borrowed for Disneyland's opening ceremony, Clarice was depicted without clothes (just like Chip 'n' Dale) instead wore an apron, and was barefoot and only kept her flower around her head.  She also shared the same design as the costumes for Chip and Dale but with half-closed eyelids.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==References== \n{{Reflist}}\n{{Mickey Mouse & Friends}}\n{{DisneyTsumTsum}}\n\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Fantasmic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Chipmunks]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Chip 'n' Dale: Park Life characters]]"
