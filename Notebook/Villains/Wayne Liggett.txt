Other than he was the one who caught Fillmore raiding the school's chalk supply and turned him in prior to the start of the series. Wayne gives him an ultimatum: Compensate by joining the Safety Patrol or do time in detention. To avoid the sentence of the former, Fillmore took the latter. Since then, they became best friends and had been partners in crime-solving and stopping, until Wayne moved away to the South. He was replaced by [[Ingrid Third]] when she came to X, as seen in\u00a0<ref>Ingrid Third, Public Enemy # 1</ref>. Fillmore's deep friendship with Wayne was the reason why he preferred to work alone and was not very accommodating to Ingrid as his new partner at first. Later, near the end of the same episode, he's seen at his new school, looking at a letter he received from his old partner. He's been mentioned or referenced to a few times also. However, he and Fillmore would reunite in\u00a0<ref>South of Friendship, North of Honor</ref>, when the latter visited him in Tennessee, where he's currently based and resides, to take on a case there. Wayne is now a member of the\u00a0Tennessee Safety Patrol\u00a0at\u00a0Macluhan Middle School, where his new partner, [[Emily Kinzey]] is also a part of the force.\u00a0\n\n==Case File==\n*Name: Wayne Liggett\n*Occupation: Safety Patroller\n*Associates:\u00a0Cornelius Fillmore\u00a0(former), Emily Kinzey (current, briefly)\n*Organizations: Safety Patrol (formerly X Middle School, currently\u00a0Maculan Middle School)\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{Fillmore!}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Liggett, Wayne}}\n[[Category:Fillmore characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Detectives]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]"
