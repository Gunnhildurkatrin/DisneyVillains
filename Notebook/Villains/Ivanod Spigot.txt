He is often at odds with [[Baloo#TaleSpin|Baloo]] and is a rabid hater of [[Cape Suzette]] and its locals.\n\nBaloo usually doesn't take Spigot seriously, and it is often Spigot's soldiers who have to thwart Baloo instead of Spigot himself. Much of Baloo's jest comes from Spigot's diminutive stature and boastfulness. When Spigot brags that he would claim a treasure for the glory of [[Thembria]], Baloo scoffs \"The only advantage he has in treasure hunting is that he is closest to the ground!\"\n\nIn one episode, being outnumbered by the muscle of Spigot and his troops, Baloo and [[Kit Cloudkicker|Kit]] play on Spigot's pompousness by sabotaging his network and messing up his orders, causing Spigot to lose his mind.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink|Ivanod Spigot}}\n{{TaleSpin}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Spigot, Ivanod}}\n[[Category:TaleSpin characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Pigs]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Military characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Warthogs]]\n[[Category:Colonels]]\n[[Category:Soldiers]]"
