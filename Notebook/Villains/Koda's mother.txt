She fights against Kenai and his brothers in order to protect her son and ends up falling off a glacier when Sitka breaks the part she is on in order to save his brothers. She survives the fall and runs off. She is later chased and killed by a vengeful Kenai, who blames her for the death of his brother. She is then taken into the world of the Great Spirits.\n\nShe is mentioned various times in the film after these events, and is also seen in Kenai's flashbacks when he puts the pieces of Koda's story together.\n\nWhen Kenai was hiding in the berry bushes Koda's mother appeared and Kenai thought that she is looking for him. But she was really calling for Koda.\n\nShe is last seen in spirit form nuzzling her son and then, along with Sitka, returns to the Great Spirits.\n\n===''[[Brother Bear 2]]''===\nShe is not seen in the second film, but is mentioned. When Kenai is missing Nita, Koda asks her and the spirits to change Kenai back into a man so he can be happy.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Before she died, and in Kenai and Koda's flashback, Koda's mother had black beady eyes, but when she reunited with Koda at the end of the movie, she had cartoony eyes the other bears had while Kenai was a bear. The change in eye design reflected how Kenai and the audience portrayed her at the time; her black, beady eyes remarked a soulless, rampaging monster who killed the protagonist's brother, but at the end of the movie, she has normal eyes since Kenai and the audience no longer saw her as a monster, but a kind, loving, and cautious and worried mother protecting her cub and herself from a pack of hunters.\n*She only speaks one line in the flashback. She is silent in the rest of the film. This makes her similar to [[Mrs. Jumbo]] from ''[[Dumbo (1941 film)|Dumbo]]'' and [[Sarafina]] from ''[[The Lion King]]'', as they also spoke only one line in the films.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nKoda's mom attacking Sitka.jpg|Koda's mother attacking [[Sitka]]\nBrother-bear-disneyscreencaps.com-2566.jpg|Koda's mother's dead body dissolves away into [[the Great Spirits]]\nKoda;s mom charging at kenai.jpg|Koda's mother charging toward [[Kenai]] in a flashback\nBrother-bear-disneyscreencaps.com-9086.jpg|Koda's mother's spirit with [[Koda]]\n</gallery>\n\n{{Brother Bear}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Bears]]\n[[Category:Brother Bear characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric animals]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Canadian characters]]\n[[Category:Spirits]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]"
