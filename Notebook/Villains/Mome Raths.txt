They are flower-like creatures.\n\n==Background==\n===Physical appearance===\nThe Mome Raths are bipedal, flower-like creatures without arms. They each have a pair of googly eyes and fuzzy hair on their heads. When they sleep, only their fuzzy hair is visible.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Alice in Wonderland]]''===\nThe Mome Raths appear in the Tulgey Wood scene when [[Alice]] loses hope and notices the [[Hammer and Pencil Birds|hammer and pencil birds]] nailing a sign diagonally across a low tree. The sign read \"Don't step on the Mome Raths\". The Mome Raths reveal themselves, then gather around and make an arrow formation. They point to a pink path that leads out of Tulgey Wood and Alice exclaims she can make it home for tea, but a dog made out of a broom dusts the path away. They are last seen looking at a very tearful Alice who is saying she will never find her home again as the woodland creatures also react when they see Alice crying as they fade away into oblivion. They are not shown later in the film.\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\nThe Mome Raths made a cameo appearance in the ''House of Mouse'' episode \"[[Pete's House of Villains]]\" where they are greeted into [[House of Mouse (night club)|the club]] by [[Donald Duck]] before being scared away by [[Pete]], who is mocking the way Donald talks.\n\n===''[[Once Upon a Time in Wonderland]]''===\nIn this show, the Mome Raths are completely different creatures from their animated counterparts; instead of resembling flowers, they are feral and carnivorous wolf-like creatures attracted by light colors. When her reign is precipitated by [[Jafar]], the [[Red Queen]] is captured by the villagers, taking revenge for her tyranny and wanting to deliver and feed her to them. She is saved by [[Cyrus (Once Upon a Time)|Cyrus]] and [[Alice]] who leaves her radiating medallion to occupy the mome raths.\n\n==Trivia==\n* In the original \"Jabberwocky\" poem, Raths are green pigs; and in the original [[wikipedia:Mischmasch|''Mischmasch'']] state are land turtles with erect heads, shark mouths, curved out front forelegs so that the animal walked on its knees, and smooth green bodies that lived on swallows and oysters (Humpty Dumpty was uncertain what \"Mome\" meant but thinks it means \"from home\" [and in the ''Mischmasch'' state \"grave\"] ).\n** The one that appeared in the [[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|2010 film]] was accurate to the original poem version\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nMomeraths3.jpg|Mome Raths forming arrow formation\nMomeraths2.jpg|Alice's first encounter with Mome Raths\nMomeraths.jpg|The Mome Raths\nMomeraths6.jpg|Mome Raths Vinylmation\nDonald&Momeraths HoM.png|Mome Raths with [[Donald Duck|Donald]] in the ''[[House of Mouse]]'' episode \"[[Pete's House of Villains]]\"\nDVG_Mome_Raths.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Alice in Wonderland}}\n[[Category:Alice in Wonderland characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Once Upon a Time characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]"
