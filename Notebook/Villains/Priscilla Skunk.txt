She is a girly skunk who loves to be the center of attention to the point where she doesn't like sharing the spotlight with anyone - even [[Sheriff Callie]].\nPriscilla also loves fashion and looking her best, as well as flowers and all things beautiful.\n\n==Personality==\nPriscilla's ego is displayed in \"Calamity Priscilla\", in which Frida Fox and her Wild West show come to Nice and Friendly Corners. Being a known celebrity, Frida Fox gets a lot of attention from the residents of Nice and Friendly Corners, which makes Priscilla jealous.\n\nPriscilla cares a lot about self-image and hates to get dirty, and it's revealed in \"My Fair Stinky\" that Priscilla is part of a Flower Club. Priscilla was embarrassed by Farmer Stinky's filth in the episode and tried to change him into a sophisticated gentleman. She was successful, but she let him go back to his old ways toward the end of the segment.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\">\nPriscilla SC1 1.png|Priscilla watches a showdown.\nPriscilla SC12 1.png\nPriscilla SC12 2.png\nPriscilla SC21 1.png|Priscilla tries to show up Frida Fox.\nPriscillaClub SC33 1.png|Priscilla and her Flower Club cower from a bee.\nTobyPriscilla SC47 2.png\nTobyPriscilla SC47 1.png\nPriscillaStinky SC49 1.png|Priscilla and Stinky.\nPriscillaCallie SC49 1.png|Priscilla smears her makeup.\nPriscilla SC49 5.png\nPriscillaCallie SC49 2.png\nPriscilla SC49 3.png\nPriscilla SC49 4.png\nDashing_Farmer_Stinky.png\nmaxresdefault 414.jpg\nmaxresdefault 415.jpg\nmaxresdefault 416.jpg\nmaxresdefault 417.jpg\nmaxresdefault 418.jpg\nmaxresdefault 419.jpg\nPriscilla and Frida.jpg|Frida tells Priscilla she's got talent.\nskunk fox friends.png|Priscilla and Frida together\nSCWW_S01E11_Calamity_Priscilla_179.jpg|Priscilla Skunk Show\nskunk 1.png\nskunk 2.png\nskunk 3.png\nskunk 4.png\nskunk 5.png\nskunk 7.png\npriscilla1.png\npriscilla3.png\npriscilla2.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Skunk, Priscilla}}{{Sheriff Callie's Wild West}}\n[[Category:Sheriff Callie's Wild West characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Skunks]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Cousins]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]"
