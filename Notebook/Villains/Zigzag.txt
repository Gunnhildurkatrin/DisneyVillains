This ended with Zero leaping on Zigzag's back and\u00a0proceeding to choke him violently.\n\nZigzag is known for his wild, frizzy hair and crazy antics, it's mentioned by Squid that he might suffer from acute paranoia, thinking that the Warden has cameras in the showers.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Zigzag was the first to sing in the \"[[Dig It]]\" single. He and Zero were the only ones not rapping.\n*In the original book, Zigzag apologizes to Stanley about teasing him and beating him up; this does not occur in the movie.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"180\" spacing=\"medium\">\nMagnet and ZigZag.JPG|Zigzag teasing Stanley about Yellow Spotted Lizards\nZiggy.JPG\nSquid and ZigZag.JPG|Squid and Zigzag telling the Warden about Zero and Stanley's deal\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Holes}}\n[[Category:Holes characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
