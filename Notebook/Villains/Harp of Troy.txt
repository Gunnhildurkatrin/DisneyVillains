She believes it is very important for people to hear the truth, even hard truths, and deal with the problems of the real world.\n\n==History==\n[[Scrooge McDuck]] and [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|the nephews]] discover the harp inside a giant stone chest held by a stone Minotaur. They ship her all the way back home to [[Duckburg]]. Scrooge uses her to detect whenever someone is lying. However, [[Magica De Spell]] wants her, and disguises herself as Helen of Troy in an attempt to get her hands on her.\n\nHowever, once the harp is removed from the box she is in, the Minotaur awakens, angry that someone has taken what is rightfully his. He follows them all the way back to [[Duckburg]], unwilling to stop until he gets his hands on her again. Submarine torpedoes and aircraft missiles seem to do no damage to him, as he seems to be protected by some sort of magic. At the end of the episode, Scrooge sadly gives the Harp back to the Minotaur.\n\nThe Harp was voiced by [[Russi Taylor]]. In the 2017 series, she is voiced by Retta.\n\nIn the 2017 series, her \"lie detector\" song goes off when\u00a0[[Betina Beakley|Mrs. Beakley]]\u00a0says she's not keeping any secrets from [[Webby]], indicating that Beakley\u00a0'''IS''' lying to Webby.\n\nIn the episode \"[[Escape from the ImpossiBin!]]\", [[F.O.W.L.]] steals the Harp.\n\n==Abilities==\nWhenever someone tell a lie in her presence, she sings, \"No-no-no-no! You're fibbing, fibbing, fibbing!\"\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nScroogeharp.png\nTumblr n1e2g4L8uv1r3jmn6o1 1280.png\nEp49 A11.jpg\nTumblr n35w7sZV8V1r3jmn6o1 1280.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{DuckTales}}\n[[Category:DuckTales objects]]\n[[Category:Magical Objects]]\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Instruments]]\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:DuckTales characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
