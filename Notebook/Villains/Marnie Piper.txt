When Marnie notices a witch in the book that looks like her, Aggie makes no attempt to quell this thought.\n\nLater that night, Marnie overhears an argument between her mother and grandmother. Marnie learns that both women are witches from Halloweentown, and that Marnie must begin training to use her powers before she loses them. Gwen refuses, favoring their normal human life. Marnie also overhears Gwen refuse to help Aggie when Aggie reports that people in Halloweentown are going missing. Marnie excitedly tells her siblings what she has heard.\n\nWhen Aggie leaves to return to Halloweentown via a magic bus, Marnie and her two siblings stow away unbeknownst to their grandmother. Becoming lost after exiting the bus, Marnie and her siblings meet the mayor, [[Kalabar]], who summons a taxi to take them to Aggie's house. Aggie is both surprised and happy to see them. Against her better judgment, Aggie chooses not to return the three children home; Aggie promises to begin Marnie's training after she solves Halloweentown's problems, which involves lighting a magic talisman. When Aggie's instant witch's brew fails, Aggie takes the kids into town to gather ingredients for a homemade recipe.\n\nWhile in town, Gwen arrives in Halloweentown and catches up to them where she plans to bring her children home much to Marnie's objections.
