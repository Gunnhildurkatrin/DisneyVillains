Prince Christopher complains that Queen Constantina can't keep interfering with his love life, but she can't seem to accept his views on the matter and asks King Maximilian what Prince Christopher means. King Maximilian explains that Prince Christopher doesn't want to have another ball, but Queen Constantina can't seem to stomach the idea. She appeals to him to talk sense into Prince Christopher, so he tells him that all they want is for him to be happy, but they feel that it's time he chose a bride and produce an heir. He explains that he wants to marry someone he's in love with and although King Maximilian understands, Queen Constantina insists there's no reason he can't find his true love at the ball. Noticing that she hasn't heard a word he said, he leaves and King Maximilian goes back to his chess match as Queen Constantina calls their servant, [[Lionel (Cinderella 1997)|Lionel]], in to inform the kingdom of the ball.\n\nOn the day of the ball, King Maximilian and Queen Constantina are overseeing the preparations and Prince Christopher is not at all happy about it. He confronts them and demand that they cancel the ball and tell everyone that they are very ashamed of themselves for going behind his back. King Maximilian states that he's never been ashamed in his life, nearly knocking Lionel down from his ladder by accident in the process. Lionel uses his diplomacy skills to arrange a compromise: Prince Christopher will go to the ball, but if he does not find a bride there he will be allowed to find his true love in his own way without any interference from King Maximilian and Queen Constantina no matter how long it takes. King Maximilian easily accepts and convinces Queen Constantina that its a fair agreement. Prince Christopher is so happy he kisses Queen Constantina, hugs King Maximilian, and gives Lionel a grateful pat before he takes his leave. Lionel reassures King Maximilian and Queen Constantina that he is sure Prince Christopher will find a bride at the ball, but Queen Constantina says Lionel \"will feel it in his bones if he doesn't\" and slaps him off his ladder. Glancing unconcernedly at the fallen Lionel, they depart.\n\nLater that evening, King Maximilian and Queen Constantina preside over the ball from their thrones, watching Prince Christopher dance unenthusiastically with various maidens. Queen Constantina is certain that he is bound to find ''someone, ''but King Maximilian isn't so optimistic. However, Queen Constantina turns out to be right when the mysterious [[Cinderella (1997 character)|Cinderella]] arrives and sweeps a mesmerized Prince Christopher off his feet. They are very intrigued by her as they watch her dance past with King Maximilian. King Maximilian even implies that if he were a younger man, he'd be wooing her himself.\n\nAfter it becomes clear that Prince Christopher is positively spellbound by Cinderella and no one else, King Maximilian and Queen Constantina join in the dancing in order to meet her. Deftly switching partners, Queen Constantina slips into a dance with Prince Christopher as King Maxmilian slides into a dance with Cinderella. He comments on her almost-magical arrival and asks her if Prince Christopher is treating her well before he and Queen Constantina switch partners again. As Queen Constantina has her turn talking with Cinderella, King Maximilian holds back Prince Christopher, who is visibly worried that Queen Constantina will somehow scare her off. His worries are proved to be justified when Cinderella suddenly dashes outside. Trampling Lionel, whom the [[Cinderella's Stepmother|Stepmother]] accidentally flung to the ground, Prince Christopher follows her into the gardens. King Maximilian and Queen Constantina, completely bemused at her unexpected reaction, wander off to discuss her after glancing unconcernedly at the once-again fallen Lionel. The next time they see Prince Christopher he pushes past them to chase after Cinderella. Unfortunately, he is unable to catch her this time.\n\nThe next morning, a very concerned King Maximilian and Queen Constantina ask Prince Christopher to eat something. He declares that he won't do so or rest until he finds Cinderella, despite King Maximilian's warning that he knows nothing about her and may never see her again. But he is determined, explaining how he's been looking for something all his life and that's he's finally found it in Cinderella. Realizing he is truly in love, King Maximilian encourages him to search for her for as long as it takes.\n\nSoon enough, King Maximilian and Queen Constantina are happily attending Prince Christopher and Cinderella's wedding.\n\n{{Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Maximilian, King}}\n[[Category:Kings]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella characters]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
