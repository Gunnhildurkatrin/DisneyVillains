He can be persuaded to take orders, but does reluctantly. He is also known to give up easily and can be hard to work with. But later on, we learn that he likes politeness and will be kind to those who are well-mannered.\n\nHowever, he can be rather judgemental to other species, notably the Crocodiles.\n\n==Role in the Series==\n===''[[Beshte and the Hippo Lanes]]''===\nBupu and his herd had to stand around in water after a rainstorm flooded their grazing grounds. The Lion Guard comes to warn about a second storm on the way and that they must follow them for their own safety. Bupu refuses saying that they don't take orders from them, but Kion says if they come, they'll lead them to food and won't have to stand around in water. Boboka convinces Bupu to reconsider for the young ones. He finally agrees, and the Guard leads them away across the a cliff slide.\n\nThe Lion Guard lead the herd around the side of a cliff, until a rockslide falls. Kion warns them to stay back which annoys Bupu after just being told to follow them. The rockslide blocks them off, however the Guard climb over it.

Although Kion still sees him as somewhat stubborn, he knows that a well-timed 'please' can persuade the sable antelope into doing what he asks.\n\n[[Fuli]]\n\nBupu and Fuli got off to a rocky start, with the sable antelope's belief that Fuli was far too aggressive and rude to both himself and his herd.
