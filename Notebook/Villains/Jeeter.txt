After Fillmore and Wayne meet again, Jeeter begins to tell him some things that went on with the latter while at his new school, but Wayne cuts him off before he can continue.

Later, Jeeter is asked for help from Fillmore pertaining to the case of the missing pralines in order to clear Wayne's name. Jeeter tells him that he heard mention of\u00a0Patrol Sheriff Thrift\u00a0and his henchmen hiding them in the storage closet. They check there, but don't find any. The patrol sheriff and his henchmen catch them searching.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n{{Fillmore!}}\n[[Category:Fillmore characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Detectives]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Irish characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]"
