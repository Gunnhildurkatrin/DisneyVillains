He also appeared in the animated short, \"[[Hare Peace]]\", where he asked [[Rapunzel]] to watch over his \"precious\". Rapunzel misunderstood \"precious\" being a bunny in a flowerbed, when Feldspar was referring to a head of cabbage. In \"[[Fitzherbert P.I.]]\", Feldspar hired [[Flynn Rider|Eugene]] for a job as a cobbler, but quickly fired him after remembering that he stole a pair of boots from him once.\n\nFeldspar played a much larger role in \"[[Painter's Block]]\", where he became the first victim of an evil spirit named [[Mrs. Sugarby]]. He was hypnotized to free her master, Zhan Tiri, followed by [[Lance Strongbow]], [[Ulf]], [[Freidborg]] and Rapunzel. His disappearance attracted the [[Captain of the Guards|Captain's]] attention, and assigned [[Cassandra (Tangled)|Cassandra]] to investigate.\n\nIn \"[[The Lost Treasure of Herz Der Sonne]]\", Feldspar and the other are in the Corona Castle's Throne Room, which was damaged from the event of Rapunzel's Return. Later, he partners with Rapunzel.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Feldspar is voiced by [[Zachary Levi]], who also voices [[Flynn Rider]].\n*His full name, Feldspar Willipeg, was mentioned by the [[Captain of the Guards]] in \"[[Painter's Block]]\".\n*Feldspar's distinct voice and characteristics were inspired by vaudevillian actor and comedian [[Ed Wynn]].\n*Feldspar can read Saporian language in \"[[The Lost Treasure of Herz Der Sonne]]\".\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\">\nFitzherbert P.I. - Eugene and Feldspar.jpg\nGreat Expotations - Varian 14.jpg\nBig-Brothers-of-Corona-1.png|Feldspar's flashback of being robbed\nQueen for a Day 21.jpg\nFeldspar-1.jpg\nFeldspar-2.jpg\nFeldspar-3.jpg\nFeldspar-4.jpg\nRapunzel's Return (95).jpg\nFeldspar made a map.png\nFeldspar speaks Saporian.png\nRapunzel angry at Feldspar.png\nRapunzel and Feldspar rollerskate.png\nFeldspar passes the trap.png\nBe Very Afraid (49).jpg\nOnce a Handmaiden...
