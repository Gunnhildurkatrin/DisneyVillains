She is the mother of the protagonist, [[Anne Boonchuy]].\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nMost of Mrs. Boonchuy's personality is only referred to by her daughter, [[Anne Boonchuy|Anne]], throughout the series. What is known about her is that she is very strict and is a very disciplined woman. When Anne was an infant, it was heavily implied that she would get aggravated by her daughter's \"high spirited\" personality and would look for things for her to do so that she could have some peace and quiet. By the time Anne became a teenager, Mrs. Boonchuy seems to have gotten over her daughter's wild side and was more calm about it. She is very protective of her to the point that she would not let her try genuine Thai food; claiming that her \"California stomach\" was incapable of handling the rich flavor. It is possible that she is out of touch with modern American culture as Anne had a tendency to mock her strange old fashioned tastes.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nMrs. Boonchuy resembles an older Anne. Much like her, she is a tall slender woman of Thai descent and bronze skin. When Anne was young, her hair was done in a shoulder length messy style, almost like Anne's hair in the series, but flatter. She at some point grew it out and put her hair up in a pony tail with a knot featuring a small butterfly on it. To indicate her age, she has crow's feet around her eyes.\n\nHer main wardeobe is a purple blue sweater, a pair of light color jeans, and a pair of greenish yellow earrings. At home she walks around barefoot, and while out she wears a pair of pink crocs.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Mrs. Boonchuy is voiced by On Braly, series creator [[Matt Braly]]'s mother.\n*Based on her telling her daughter that her \"California stomach\" cannot handle the street food, it is implied that she was born in Thailand.\n*Her first appearance in \"[[Family Fishing Trip]]\" off-screen is her voice and first official appearance in \"[[The New Normal]]\".\n\n==Gallery==\n===Promotional and Concept===\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\">\nAmphibia season 3 poster.jpg\nLost in Newtopia concept art.jpg\nFile:Boonchuy residence kitchen and Mrs. Boonchuy Color concept art.jpg\nFile:The New Normal Concept art Mrs. Boonchuy by Cat Sukiman & Andy Garner.jpg|Mrs. Boonchuy Model sheet\n</gallery>\n\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\">\nIvy on the Run still 2.png\nFam Reunion (Amphibia Season 3- Anne is back!).png\nThe-New-Normal Anne's parants blissfuly unaware.png\nThai Feud 1.jpg\nFight at the Museum 1.jpg|\"Who are you and what you done with my daughter?\"\nFight at the Museum (6).jpg\nFight at the Museum (8).jpg\nAnne-sterminator (9).jpg\nAnne-sterminator (11).jpg|\"A mom can dream, can't she?\"\nAnne-sterminator (14).jpg\nAnne-sterminator (19).jpg\nFile:Anne-sterminator (39).png\nFile:Anne-sterminator (40).png\nFile:Anne-sterminator (41).png|\"Leave my daughter alone!\"\nAnne-sterminator (25).jpg|Mrs. Boonchuy fighting the [[Cloak-Bot]] to save her daugher\nAnne-sterminator (33).jpg\nFile:Anne-sterminator (46).png|Mrs. Boonchuy embracing the planters and Anne\nMr. X (1).jpg\nMr. X (6).jpg\nMr. X (9).jpg\nMr. X (11).jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*[[w:c:amphibiapedia:Mrs. Boonchuy|Mrs. Boonchuy]] at the [[w:c:amphibiapedia|Amphibia Wiki]]\n\n{{Amphibia}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Amphibia characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n\n[[Category:Asian characters]]"
