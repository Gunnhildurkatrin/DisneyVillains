However, Mrs. Hasagawa does not understand Nani and it takes a few times for Nani to remind Mrs. Hasagawa of her ad in the paper. Nearby, a hula practice between [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] with [[Stitch]] sends the alien twirling into Mrs. Hasagawa. They collide into the fruit stands and Mrs. Hasagawa gets a watermelon stuck on her head with Stitch poking out on top.\n\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nMrs. Hasagawa makes a few appearances in the series. In \"[[Mrs. Hasagawa's Cats]]\", it is revealed that she keeps many experiments, thinking they are cats\u00a0at [[Mrs. Hasagawa's House|her house]]. Most of these experiments are activated when Mrs. Hasagawa mistakes their [[Experiment Pods|pods]] for apricots and washes them to eat.\n\nIn \"[[Checkers (episode)|Checkers]]\", she is called a troublemaker by [[Mertle Edmonds|Mertle]], [[Elena, Teresa, and Yuki]] when Lilo was temporarily their queen.\n\nIn the [[Morpholomew (episode)|crossover episode]] with ''[[American Dragon: Jake Long]]'', [[Luong Lao Shi|Lao Shi]] falls in love with her, though they regretfully depart at the end of the episode.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nIn the film, it is revealed that Mrs. Hasagawa has yet another experiment under her care,\u00a0a [[Cloudy|cloud-like experiment]] that helps her at work\u00a0by watering her fruit at the stand.\n\n==Experiments==\nMrs. Hasagawa owns fifteen experiments whom she took in, thinking they were cats and one that works with her at her fruit stand. Most of these experiments were activated when Mrs. Hasagawa mistook their pods for apricots and washed them to eat. They include:\n\n*[[Doubledip]]\n*[[Gotchu]]\n*[[Forehead]]\n*[[Hocker]]\n*[[Zawp]]\n*[[Mulch]]\n*[[Shredder]]\n*[[Pix]]\n*[[Boomer (Lilo & Stitch)|Boomer]]\n*[[Cloudy]]\n*[[Manners]]\n*[[Woody (Lilo & Stitch)|Woody]]\n*[[Wrapper]]\n*[[Blowhard]]\n*[[Derrick]]\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the intro sequence of [[Lilo & Stitch: The Series|the series]], Mrs. Hasagawa appears in two squares in the hula dance, with her image and movements mirrored to one another.\n*Stitch mispronounces her name as \"Hasagasawa\".\n*Mrs. Hasagawa has experiments from every series with the exception of the 4-series and 6-series.\n*Aside from Hocker, the experiments under her care are not life-threatening, and most are only designed to frustrate their targets with mild inconveniences.\n*It is unknown if she, being the caretaker of several alien life forms, is under the official protection of the United Galactic Federation as Lilo and Nani are.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nMrs. Hasagawa.png|Mrs. Hasagawa artwork\nlilo-stitch-disneyscreencaps.com-5085.png\nVlcsnap-2012-12-23-10h17m08s41.png|Mrs. Hasagawa with [[Derrick]]\nvlcsnap-2012-12-23-10h47m29s55.png\nvlcsnap-2012-12-23-10h50m48s17.png|Mrs. Hasagawa with [[Boomer (Lilo & Stitch)|Boomer]]\nvlcsnap-2012-07-01-22h20m36s58.png|Mrs. Hasagawa with [[Woody (Lilo & Stitch)|Woody]]\nvlcsnap-2012-07-03-21h08m16s165.png|Mrs. Hasagawa with [[Cloudy]]\nvlcsnap-2012-12-25-19h46m46s129.png\nvlcsnap-2012-12-27-19h08m48s21.png\nvlcsnap-2012-12-27-19h08m55s102.png\nvlcsnap-2012-12-27-20h03m49s253.png\nvlcsnap-2013-01-04-17h21m07s207.png\nvlcsnap-2013-01-04-17h21m11s251.png\nvlcsnap-2013-01-04-17h47m35s218.png\nvlcsnap-2013-01-08-09h31m19s66.png\nvlcsnap-2013-01-08-14h25m02s165.png\nvlcsnap-2013-01-14-12h40m30s179.png\nvlcsnap-2013-02-17-17h25m29s243.png\nVlcsnap-2012-11-02-22h33m08s170.png|Mrs. Hasagawa with [[Luong Lao Shi|Lao Shi]]\nvlcsnap-2013-02-17-17h41m55s111.png\nvlcsnap-2013-03-25-13h12m31s132.png\nvlcsnap-2013-03-25-13h12m39s209.png\nLilo_&_Stitch_The_Series_intro_-_characters_hula_dancing.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hasagawa}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Polynesian characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Disney Crossy Road characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
