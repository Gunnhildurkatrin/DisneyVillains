He subsequently appeared in ''Walt Disney's Comics and Stories'' #309, as well as in ''[[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]]<nowiki>'s Junior Woodchucks</nowiki>'' #1, 2, 49, and 50.\n\n==Background==\nNewton is a fan of his uncle's work, and wants to be an inventor like him when he grows up. Newton is also a Junior Woodchuck, as well as a friend of Huey, Dewey, and Louie. In some comics, Newton is referred to as '''Giggy'''.\n\nAfter the early 1970s, Newton ceased appearing in new North American Disney comics. He continued to be used in some Italian and Danish-produced Disney comics into the late 1990s.\n\nThere was a similar character in the [[DuckTales]] episode \"[[Superdoo!]]\", like Newton he was also in the Junior Woodchucks. Though his name is never spoken he does bear a physical resemblance to Newton Gearloose.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gearloose, Newton}}\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Chickens]]\n[[Category:Nephews]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
