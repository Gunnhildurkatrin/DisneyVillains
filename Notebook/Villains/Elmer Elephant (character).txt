Very much the reason why Tillie adores him. But unfortunately, this also makes him the target for bullies. Elmer is also very brave.\n\n==Role in the short==\nElmer is invited to Tillie Tiger's birthday party, bringing her a bouquet of flowers. Tillie loves Elmer, but the other animal kids make fun of his nose and cruelly mock him when Tillie isn't around to defend him. Brokenhearted by their teasing, Elmer leaves the party and cries in front of the nearby pond. Elmer is reassured by a nearby elderly giraffe named Joe who admits to him that he used to suffer the same teasing about his neck. Just then, a fire breaks out at Tillie's tree-house with Tillie still in it. The rescue efforts by the other children as well as a monkey fire brigade prove futile. With the help of Joe Giraffe and some pelicans who resemble Jimmy Durante, Elmer successfully puts out the fire and rescues Tillie.\n\nElmer would later go on to star in his own comic stories in the ''Silly Symphonies'' comic strip, even getting his own short-lived comic strip. However, with the exceptions of the crowd shots in the later ''Silly Symphonies'' short ''[[Toby Tortoise Returns]]'' and a cameo appearance in ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', Elmer was never again featured in animation afterward, although his name was mentioned on a punch card in the ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'' cartoon, \"[[Donald's Rocket Ruckus]]\".\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"200\" position=\"center\">\nElmer Elephant Shy.jpg\nElmer Elephant With flowers.jpg\nElmer Elephant.jpg\nElmer Elephant1.jpg\nElmer Elephant2.jpg\nElmer Elephant3.jpg\nElmer Elephant4.jpg\nElmer Elephant5.jpg\nElmer Elephant6.jpg\nElmer Elephant7.jpg\nElmer Elephant8.jpg\nElmer Elephant9.jpg\nElmer Elephant10.jpg\nElmer Elephant11.jpg\nElmer Elephant12.jpg\nFifer and fiddler elmer and tillie in toby tortoise returns.jpg|Elmer and Tillie Tiger make cameo appearances in ''[[Toby Tortoise Returns]]''\nSeiberling elmer.jpg\n1941 RKO DIS.png\nShusympdeck.jpg\n1938CastellCrdGameB9.jpg\nCarriedAway2.jpeg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Elephants]]\n[[Category:Silly Symphonies characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Who Framed Roger Rabbit cameos]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse (TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
