From there, her rise in show biz was meteoric, and the ravishing beauty is known as The Jewel of the Dakotas. Though she has always wanted to perform serious drama, her fans have never let her forget her feather boa and her parasol, both of which have been promised to the Daughters of Benton County Western Museum when they wear out. In Grizzly Hall she performs her famous \u201cHeart, We Did All We Could\u201d while descending from the ceiling on a swing. She has been called The Last of the Big Time Swingers.''\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\n120413_attraction-rewind-country-bear-christmas-special-skis-feat-1_1.jpg\nScanned 1972 Spring.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* She is referenced in [[The Country Bears|''The Country Bears'']]'' ''through the Barrington family speedboat being named the \"Teddi Barra-Cuda\".{{The Country Bears}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Barra, Teddi}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Bears]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Country Bear characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Singers]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
