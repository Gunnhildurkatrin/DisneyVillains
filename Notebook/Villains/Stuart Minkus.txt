When told he was wrong, Minkus stood up and went to the nurse.\n*Appeared again in \"Graduation\", was upset because Cory, Topanga, and Shawn never spoke to him.\n**When Cory asked him where he had been, he simply said in the other part of the school and gestured offscreen. He then called to [[Mr. Turner]], who hadn't been seen for a full season at that point.\n\n==Appearance==\n\"'''[[Boy Meets World]]'''\"\n\n'''Season 1'''\n*On the Fence (''First appearance'')\n*Father Knows Less\n*Cory's Alternative Friends\n*Killer Bee\n*Boys II Mensa\n*Teacher's Bet\n*Class Pre-Union\n*Santa's Little Helper\n*The Father/Son Game\n*Once in Love with Amy\n*She Loves Me, She Loves Me Not\n*The B-Team of Life\n*Model Family\n*Risky Business\n*The Fugitive\n*Kid Gloves\n*The Play's the Thing\n*Boy Meets Girl\n*I Dream of Feeny\n'''Season 5'''\n*Graduation (''Final appearance'')\n\n==Trivia==\n*The writers had originally intended to name him \"Stuart Lempke\".
