He was voiced by [[Will Ryan]].\n\n==Personality==\nBarnaby is\u00a0a goofy dog who is the clown/magician known as \"Barnaby the Great\". He is known for saying, \"Ah-hee-ee-ee-ee-ee!\" whenever he laughs and sounds like he's from the south. His tricks don't always work out the way he wants them to. He is good friends with [[Lionel]] and [[Q.T.]]. He also gets scared easily. He often hums his signature song \"[[I'm Just a Lucky Dog]].\"\n\nHe comes from a big family: Edison Bowser (who invented flea powder), Isadoga Bowser (a famous dancer who perfected the \"Dog trot\"), Julia Bowser (his favorite as she invented the hot dog) and Lattimer Bowser, III, his famous explorer uncle.\n\nAfter several attempts, Barnaby was the last to join Dumbo's Circus before Fair Dinkum's twin brother, Rinkum Dinkum, came along.\n\n{{Dumbo}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Clowns]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Circus performers]]\n[[Category:Servants]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Dumbo's Circus characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
