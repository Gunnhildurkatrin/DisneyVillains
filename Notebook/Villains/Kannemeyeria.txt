Their face resembles that of a [[Triceratops]]. They have stubby legs and a small tail.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Fantasia]]''===\nA Kannemeyeria briefly appears in ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' segment of ''[[Fantasia]]'', crawling to a heard of [[Plateosaurus]] that were digging for clams; it snatched one and snuck away while the Plateosaurs weren't looking. Later it was amongst the other dinosaurs running out of the way of the approaching  [[Tyrannosaurus Rex]].  Anchisaurus tripped over it during the chaos. It was later seen among the ones viewing the fight between the Tyrannosaurus Rex and the [[Stegosaurus]].  Around the time of the extinction scene, it was shown eating some roots from a barren tree that a [[Parasaurolophus]] was eating at before trying to get some water from a small hole that a [[Corythosaurus]] and a Gryposaurus were drinking at, which was made easier when the Gryposaurus lifted its head from drinking to look around from behind.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Ironically, in real life, Kannemeyeria was extinct before the extinction that is depicted in ''Fantasia''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nHyperodapedodon-sketch.png|Concept sketch\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Fantasia}}\n[[Category:Reptiles]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric animals]]\n[[Category:Fantasia characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric characters]]"
