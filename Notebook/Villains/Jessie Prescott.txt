Even though Jessie's life isn't the most realistic (this is a Disney comedy, after all), young kids won't mind a bit. Instead, they'll see a thoroughly likable character who stays optimistic as she navigates a new city and a new job, showing kids the value of maintaining a positive attitude in the face of a challenge.\"<ref>http://www.commonsensemedia.org/new/10-best-tv-role-models</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Jessie}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Prescott, Jessie}}\n[[es:Jessie Prescott]]\n[[Category:Jessie characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Nannies]]\n[[Category:Austin & Ally characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Ultimate Spider-Man characters]]\n[[Category:Good Luck Charlie characters]]\n[[Category:Military characters]]\n[[Category:Time travelers]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
