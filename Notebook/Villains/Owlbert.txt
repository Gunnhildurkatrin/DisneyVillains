Eda often uses him to either steal from the human realm or as a distraction against opponents. Despite being an enchanted object used to cast magic, Owlbert has a sense of independence and can attach and reattach from his staff either by command or on his own free will. He has a very close bond with Eda, who is shown to be protective of him.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nOwlbert bears the appearance of a typical owl, displaying brown-toned feathers, golden-yellow eyes, and orange feet. A staff-binding interlock is located underneath his right foot that allows him to detach from atop of Eda's staff.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The name Owlbert is a play on the name \"Albert\".\n*Owlbert shares the same name as a [[1988]] children's book title ''Owlbert'' written by Nicholas Harris.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nThe Owl House 47.png|Riding the Owl Staff\nA Lying Witch and a Warden 2.jpg\nTOH Magic Staff.png\nThe Owl House 6.png\nEda's staff.png\nThe Owl House 94.png\nCovention (69).png|Owlbert pecking [[Lilith Clawthorne]]\nCovention (70).png\nHooty's Moving Hassle (2).png|Playing Hexes Holdem\nHooty's Moving Hassle (4).png\nOnce Upon a Swap (59).png\nEscape of the Palisman (6).png|He likes that\nEscape of the Palisman (9).png\nEscape of the Palisman (12).png\nEscape of the Palisman (23).png\nEscape of the Palisman (26).png\nThe Owl House 167.png\nThe Owl House 137.png\nEscape of the Palisman (28).png\nEscape of the Palisman (36).png\nEscape of the Palisman (67).png\nEscape of the Palisman (68).png\nEscape of the Palisman (85).png\nEscape of the Palisman (92).png|Owlbert now a Boo Boo Buddy\nReally Small Problems (56).png\nAgony of a Witch (84).png\nYoung Blood, Old Souls (48).png\nThe Owl House S2 (1).png\nEchoes of the Past (68).jpg\nEclipse Lake (96).jpg\nEclipse Lake (102).jpg\nThe Owl House Promo.jpg\nThe Owl House second poster.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*[[w:c:theowlhouse:Owlbert|Owlbert]] on [[w:c:theowlhouse|The Owl House Wiki]]\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{The Owl House}}\n[[pt-br:Bast\u00e3o Coruja]]\n[[Category:Magical Objects]]\n[[Category:Owls]]\n[[Category:The Owl House characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Objects]]"
