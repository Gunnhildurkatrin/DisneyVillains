'''Experiment 151''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]]. He\u00a0is designed to turn entire populations into babies, causing planetary chaos; the antidote consists of two teaspoons of applesauce, one cup of milk, three mashed bananas, and a dollop of 100% Kona coffee. Any\u00a0de-aged victims who are left untreated will have to grow up all over again. His one true place is at the [[Aloha Animal Rescue|dog shelter]], turning old dogs into adorable puppies, thus making them more appealing to potential adopters.\n\n==Background==\n===Physical appearance===\nBabyfier is a small light pink koala-like experiment with a large\u00a0head with a baby-like face, tiny purple insect-like wings, stubby legs, short stubby ears, plump cheeks, blue nose, a yellow pacifier in his mouth and a long baby rattle-shaped tail with dark pink stripes.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nBabyfier can sprinkle a pink powder from his rattle-like tail, causing his victims to regress physically and mentally into babies. The only cure to Babyfier's victims is a remedy mix of two teaspoons of applesauce, one cup of milk, three mashed bananas, and a dollop of 100% Kona coffee that reverts all victims to their original age. If the victims are not cured, they will have to grow up all over again.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment 151 was the 151st genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to turn entire civilizations into babies, throwing the planet into unsupervised chaos.\u00a0151 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai, with 151's pod landing on a sidewalk.\n\nWhen\u00a0the [[Ice Cream Man]]\u00a0tripped on 151's pod, it rolled across a nearby [[Lahui Beach|beach]]\u00a0shore and into an ocean wave, activating the experiment.\u00a0151 then proceeded to turn the tourist into a baby,\u00a0causing him to behave like an infant. He was later photographed by [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Stitch]], who both consulted [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] and learned about 151's powers.\n\nLater, 151 went on a rampage by\u00a0turning\u00a0others, including a construction worker, into babies before Stitch captured him in a bucket. After running into [[Nani Pelekai|Nani]], who mistook\u00a0Lilo and Stitch for trying to sneak\u00a0off to the movies unsupervised, they took 151, named Babyfier, back to their [[Lilo's House|house]], where Lilo had a falling-out with Nani.\n\nThat night,\u00a0Stitch released Babyfier on Nani\u00a0so Lilo could be in charge for once. However, after turning Nani into a baby, Babyfier turned Stitch, Jumba, and [[Pleakley]] into babies too.\u00a0Babyfier then attempted to do the same to Lilo, but the former was lured into a trap and recaptured, leaving Lilo to look after her de-aged [[Pelekai \u02bbohana|''\u02bbohana'']].\n\n[[Captain Gantu|Gantu]], who had been searching\u00a0for the experiment,\u00a0arrived at\u00a0the Pelekais' house the next day. Since Lilo's family was all babyfied and helpless, Gantu managed to take Babyfier back to [[Gantu's Ship|his ship]].\n\nWhen [[Reuben|Experiment 625]] learned that Babyfier turns adults into babies, he released the experiment\u00a0on Gantu out of curiosity. However, after turning Gantu into a baby, Babyfier attempted to do the same\u00a0to Reuben, causing the latter to lock Babyfier out of the ship. [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]] was then alerted and demanded them both to retrieve Babyfier.\n\nMeanwhile, the babyfied Jumba (who still retained the personality and intellect of adult Jumba) managed to find a cure on [[Jumba's Computer|his computer]] that would reverse Babyfier's effects. Lilo despaired when she saw that one of the ingredients for the antidote was a dollop of 100% Kona coffee, which only adults were allowed to buy.\n\nOutside with her infantile ''\u02bbohana'', Lilo tried coaxing [[Charles and Mary|a passing couple]]\u00a0to buy her the desired coffee before Babyfier turned them into babies. A moment later, Reuben and the babyfied Gantu pursued Babyfier as he went on a second rampage, followed by Lilo and the babyfied Nani and Stitch.\n\nMeanwhile, the babyfied Jumba and Pleakley traveled to [[Kiki's Coffee Hut]], where they found several bags of 100% Kona coffee on a shelf to make the remedy for undoing Babyfier's effects.\n\nLater, the babyfied Stitch and Gantu tracked Babyfier down to a playground, where the two fought over him while bickering, with Stitch winning. After Babyfier was recaptured, Jumba and Pleakley (back to their normal ages) arrived with the antidote, which Stitch blasted into the sky, turning all the babies on Kauai except Gantu back into adults.\n\nAfter Nani made amends\u00a0with Lilo, Babyfier was then found a one true place at the [[Aloha Animal Rescue|dog pound]],\u00a0where\u00a0he turned old dogs into adorable and more adoptable puppies, effectively giving them a second chance at\u00a0finding a new home.\n\nIt is known that the babyfied Gantu was somehow\u00a0turned back into\u00a0his adult self, as he was seen at his normal age in later episodes, while Reuben was forced to babysit Gantu in the meantime.\n\nIn \"[[Ploot (episode)|Ploot]]\", Babyfier was one of the second team of experiments (along with [[Finder]] and [[Drowsy]]) formed to try and stop [[Ploot]]. However, Ploot was easily able to defeat them, forcing the three experiments to retreat.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nIn the film's opening, Babyfier can be seen waving hello to [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], along with [[Snooty]] and [[Amnesio]].\n\nLater, the first 624 experiments, including Babyfier, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium\u00a0to be destroyed. However, Lilo, [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]], and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nBabyfier participated in the following battle between the experiments and the\u00a0[[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]] by turning attacking Leroys into babies.\n\nHowever, the Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.\n\n===''[[Stitch!]]''===\nBabyfier made an appearance in Season 2\u00a0of the\u00a0''Stitch!'' anime along with [[Hammerface]], [[Link]], [[Spike (Lilo & Stitch)|Spike]], and [[Woody (Lilo & Stitch)|Woody]]. It is revealed that [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]] reverted these experiments to evil using a recording of [[Angel]]'s song, thus enabling them to wreak havoc on the [[Izayoi Island|island]]. In another episode, Babyfier was reprogrammed by H\u00e4msterviel to transform his victims into toddlers instead of babies (and appropriately renamed '''Toddler-fier'''). He left [[Stitch]] in charge of several schoolchildren whom he turned into toddlers, including [[Yuna Kamihara|Yuna]] herself. He\u00a0made a third appearance in aiding Stitch in battle against [[Dark End]].\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Even though Stitch was not born as a baby (being a genetic experiment), Babyfier still managed to turn him into an infant.\n**This happens again in ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]'', as in one scene, Babyfier turns three Leroy clones\u00a0into infants. This also shows that while experiments have different lifespans\u00a0and aging cycles than humans (as seen in \"[[Skip (episode)|Skip]]\"), they still have different stages of life. Simply put, \"experiment years\" are not equal\u00a0with \"human years\".\n*Babyfier's [[Experiment Pods|pod]]\u00a0color is white.\n*Babyfier's tail appears in the online game ''[[Jumba's Lab (Game)|Jumba's Lab]]''.\n*In the English dub of the ''[[Stitch!]]'' anime episode \"Link-age\",\u00a0[[Reuben]] states that Babyfier's favorite type of sandwich is pur\u00e9ed carrots.\n*Babyfier has the same number as the Pok\u00e9mon character [[Bulbapedia:Mew (Pok\u00e9mon)|Mew]] in addition to a similar appearance.\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
