She appears in only one scene when she spots him and falls in love with him after she tricks him into noticing her. She sings and walks up to him and says her only line: \"Hello\" and is last seen petting his ear.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Bambi (film)|Bambi]]''===\nRight after [[Bambi (character)|Bambi]], Thumper and [[Flower]] claimed that they will never fall in love, Miss Bunny notices them and fashions herself up making her look flirtatious and noticeable. She struts up close to Thumper and bats her eyelashes at him, saying \u201chello\u201d. Thumper eventually spots her and she woos him with charm and a kiss.\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\nMiss Bunny was seen in the episode \"[[Jiminy Cricket (House of Mouse)|Jiminy Cricket]]\", sitting with Thumper and his friends, while staring at Thumper.\n\n===[[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Disney Parks]]===\nMiss Bunny currently makes appearances for meets and greets at [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]] at Walt Disney World with Thumper (formerly at [[Camp Minnie-Mickey]]). In [[Japan]], she is very popular not just for Disney but other things as well, except she has pink cheeks and often wears a pink flower on her ear (which is used at Disneyland Paris).\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Although she wasn't given a name in the film, in ''[[Kingdom Hearts \u03c7]]'' (as a costume) and many merchandise and the Disney Parks, she is referred to as \"Miss Bunny.\"\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nTh5OMuYqCGxKW4cDaTEc 2X8S6A.png\nHouse Of Mouse chip fans.jpg\nF10.jpg\nMiss Bunny WDW.jpg|Miss Bunny at Walt Disney World.\nMiss Bunny Tsum Tsum Mini.jpg\nHarajuku Miss Bunny Tsum Tsum Mini - 1.jpg\nOsaka Miss Bunny Tsum Tsum Mini.jpg\nTsum Tsum Game Characters.jpeg\nMiss Bunny Tsum Tsum Game.png|[[Disney Tsum Tsum (game)|''Tsum Tsum'']]\nMiss Bunny Valentine Tsum Tsum Mini.jpg\nTsum Tsum Poster.jpg\nUniqloMsRabbitTsum.jpg\nBambi Tsum Tsum Collection.jpg\nTsum Tsum 3DS Cover.jpg\nMiss Bunny Kingdom Hearts \u03c7.png|''[[Kingdom Hearts \u03c7]]'': [[Miss Bunny]] Costume\nMiss Bunny plush.jpg\nMiss Bunny Dressy Tsum Tsum Mini.jpg\nMiss Bunny Tsum Tsum Vinyl Figure Set.jpg\nA4 Notebook Tsum Tsum.jpg\nMiss Bunny Tsum Tsum Mini (Wave Two).jpg\nBambi-clipart-disney-cartoon-character-849169-161464.png|Miss Bunny is sit on a floor and look plants\nD4nSFwyW4AIslgu.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Bambi}}\n{{DisneyTsumTsum}}\n[[es:La Conejita]]\n[[it:Coniglietta]]\n[[nl:Mevrouw Konijn]]\n[[Category:Bambi characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Rabbits]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Raw Toonage Characters]]\n[[Category:Celebrate the Magic characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Tsum Tsum characters]]"
