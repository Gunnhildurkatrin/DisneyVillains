Wendy was responsible for a breakthrough in artificial intelligence that lead to the creation of [[Tadashi Hamada]]'s revolutionary healthcare companion, [[Baymax]]. However, her thesis was stolen by Trengrove and used to build up an illustrious career. Wendy, meanwhile, would never receive the credit she deserved, and instead became a children's television host that taught science to young audiences.\n\n==Role in the [[Big Hero 6: The Series|series]]==\nAfter being denied access to a workshop hosted by Trengrove [[Hiro Hamada]] instead attended Wendy's workshop for juvenile scientists. Wendy takes note of Hiro's disappointment and tries to cheer him up, but is unsuccessful. Hiro is, nevertheless, impressed by Wendy's knowledge of robotics, as she was fascinated by the inner-workings of Baymax.\n\nLater on, Hiro asks Wendy and her students to help distract the villain [[Mr. Yama]] with their baking soda volcanos while he and [[Fred (Big Hero 6)|Fred]] sneak into Trengrove's workshop hall.\n\nAt the end of the episode, Wendy lends her ukulele to [[Karmi]], who tried to sing a song of her own for her Woweroos. At the same time Trevor stepped out of his pavilion and ran into Wendy, [[Big Hero 6 (team)|Big Hero 6]] arrived and return to Trevor a flash drive they retrieved from Yama. Trevor\u2014out of guilt\u2014confesses that the flash drive contained evidence that he stole Wendy's thesis and wants to make things right by sharing the truth with the world. Rather than being upset, Wendy thanks Trevor for finally admitting the truth. She later takes a night tour of S.F.I.T. with Hiro; in during which, she reveals that Professor Granville was her mentor. This confuses Hiro, as he and the other students were told that Granville was an entirely new member of the staff, prompting him to look into the university's history.\n\nWendy (now with the title \"Dr.\") later appeared in \"[[Countdown to Catastrophe]]\", where she attended the school's end of the semester showcase alongside other big names in the scientific field.\n\nWendy returns in \"[[City of Monsters]]\" where [[Mr. Sparkles]] kidnaps her on orders of [[Di Amara]]. She is later rescued by Big Hero 6.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Wendy's television persona was inspired by Professor Granville.<ref>\"[[Countdown to Catastrophe]]\"</ref>\n*Wendy is clearly based on classic educational science TV hosts such as Beakman (Paul Zaloom) from ''Beakman's World'' and [[Bill Nye]] of ''[[Bill Nye the Science Guy]]''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nSmall Hiro One 27.jpg\nSmall Hiro One 15.png\nSmall Hiro One 1.jpg\nSmall Hiro One 3.jpeg|Young Wendy Wower\nCountdown to Catastropher 27.png\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Big Hero 6}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wower, Wendy}}\n[[Category:Big Hero 6 characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
