He acts very effeminate and loves fashion. Because of that he gets made fun of constantly. His father who is a coach and gym teacher is embarrassed by him. Penny's male friend, and is a good fashion designer and basketball player. He is also a choreographer. In public, he is forced to call his father \"Coach\" instead of \"Daddy.\" Michael's dad is the coach at [[Willy T. Ribbs Middle School]]. Though he is often bullied, he is a big trash talker and gets along well with others more often than not.\n\nIn the sequel series, ''Louder and Prouder'', Michael is presumably now transgender and gender non-conforming. It's unknown if they kept the same name. \n\n==Episode Appearance==\n===Season One===\n*\"[[Bring it On (The Proud Family)|Bring it On ]]\"\n*\"[[She's Got Game]]\"\n*\"[[Love Thy Neighbor]]\"\n*\"[[The Altos]]\"\n*\"[[Hip-Hop Helicopter]]\"\n*\"[[Romeo Must Wed]]\"\n\n===Season Two===\n*\"[[A Star is Scorned (The Proud Family)|A Star Is Scorned]]\"\n*''[[Tween Town]]''\n*\"[[Wedding Bell Blues]]\"\n\n===Season Three===\n*\"[[Election]]\"\n*\"[[The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly]]\"\n*\"[[Twins to Tweens]]\"\n*\"[[Suga Mama's Believers]]\"\n*\"[[Who You Callin' a Sissy|Who You Callin' a Sissy?]]\"\n*''[[The Proud Family Movie]]''\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\">\nA Star is Scorned.jpg\nWedding Blue Bells (2).jpg\nWedding Blue Bells (3).jpg\nvlcsnap-2013-09-12-11h09m54s20.png\nvlcsnap-2013-09-12-11h10m57s196.png\nVlcsnap-2013-09-12-11h20m04s16.png\nvlcsnap-2013-09-12-11h15m39s186.png\nvlcsnap-2013-09-12-11h16m50s106.png\nvlcsnap-2013-09-12-11h19m34s41.png\nThe Proud Family Movie (5).jpg\nThe Proud Family Movie (4).jpg\nvlcsnap-2016-04-26-15h55m48s537.png\nvlcsnap-2016-04-26-19h39m31s489.png\nvlcsnap-2016-04-26-21h38m25s757.png\nvlcsnap-2016-04-26-22h11m37s487.png\nvlcsnap-2016-04-26-22h11m13s737.png\nvlcsnap-2016-04-26-22h12m37s970.png\nvlcsnap-2016-04-27-10h02m19s472.png\nvlcsnap-2016-04-26-22h30m21s200.png\nvlcsnap-2016-04-26-22h30m52s443.png\nvlcsnap-2016-04-26-22h30m38s527.png\nvlcsnap-2016-05-08-23h44m35s272.png\nvlcsnap-2016-05-08-23h48m16s746.png\nvlcsnap-2016-05-09-00h05m34s208.png\nvlcsnap-2016-05-09-00h05m38s313.png\nvlcsnap-2016-05-09-00h06m36s483.png\nvlcsnap-2016-05-09-08h50m57s984.png\nvlcsnap-2016-05-09-09h20m15s246.png\nvlcsnap-2016-05-09-09h20m27s832.png\nvlcsnap-2016-05-09-13h32m20s800.png\nSticky & Duke in New Clothes.PNG\nvlcsnap-2016-06-06-17h06m14s894.png\nmichaelmonster.png\nScreen Shot 2021-05-12 at 1.24.00 PM.png|Michael Collins in ''The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder''\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n{{The Proud Family}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Collins, Micheal}}\n[[Category:The Proud Family characters]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
