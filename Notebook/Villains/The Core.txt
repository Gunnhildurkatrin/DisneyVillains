They traverse the castle's many passages and briefly come across the Moss Man. Soon, they manage to find Marcy and revive her, but are all trapped in a hologram that preys on their worst fears. After overcoming the illusions by destroying the source, Andrias appears and reveals that they used the Moss Man to revive Marcy and that her intelligence was what was needed for an entity called the Core to be rebirthed. The Core transfers to Marcy's body, taking her over.\n\n==Relationships==\n===[[King Andrias]]===\nThe ruler of Amphibia refers to the Core as \"My Lord\" implying that the creature is his master. Andrias serves the Core and heals [[Marcy Wu]] from her injuries inflicted by Andrias himself as the Core required a host who possessed high intelligence and was capable of beating Andrias at Flipwart. Andrias did not agree with the Core on using Marcy as a host, but followed his master's orders anyhow after recapturing Marcy and allowing the Core to possess her body.\n\n===[[Marcy Wu]]===\nThe Core sought Marcy Wu as its host due to her possessing high intelligence and being capable at beating Andrias at the game Flipwart. After Marcy had been healed from the injuries she sustained from Andrias, she was restrained and possessed by the Core.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nAndrias bows to Mysterious Entity.PNG\nS3-Amphibia-Core-Marcy-Image.png|The Core in Marcy's body\nThe Core Profile.png\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*Some fans referred to dubbed this creature as \"The Night\".\n\n==External links==\n\n*[https://amphibia.fandom.com/wiki/The_Core The Core] at the [[w:c:amphibiapedia:Main Page|Amphibia Wiki]]\n* [https://villains.fandom.com/wiki/The_Core The Core] at  the [https://villains.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page Villains Wiki]\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Amphibia}}\n[[Category:Amphibia characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Unseen characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Gods]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Robots]]"
