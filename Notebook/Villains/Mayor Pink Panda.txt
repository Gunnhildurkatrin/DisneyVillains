She has dark blue googly eyes, and she wears a teal hat with a light pink flower attached.\n\n==Personality==\nUnlike the rest of the denizens of the Plush Toy World, Mayor Pink Panda isn't usually happy. She is a tad world-weary, though such wear and tear (as it were) likely comes from the stress of running a city. Regardless, she can be friendly when she wants to.\n\n\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Penn Zero: Part-Time Hero}}\n[[Category:Penn Zero: Part-Time Hero characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Toys]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Mayors]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Character stubs]]\n[[Category:Stub]]\n[[Category:Bears]]\n[[Category:Pandas]]\n[[Category:Politicians]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]"
