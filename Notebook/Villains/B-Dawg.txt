He wears a silver chain necklace with the letter \"B\" on it and usually ends his sentences with \"Dawg.\" His catchphrase is: \"I am the ultimate P-U-P!\" He always tries to show off and make everyone think he is not scared when he actually is. When talking to his siblings or his mom, he always uses slang, which often perplexes them. He is sometimes rebellious, as shown in [[Air Buddies|the first Air Buddies film]] when he said, \"No one tells B-Dawg he has to take a nap,\" after Mrs. Niggles told the Air Buddies to rest. He lives in Fernfield, [[Washington]], with his famous all-star father, [[Air Bud (dog)|Buddy]], and mother, [[Molly (Air Bud)|Molly]]. His owner is Billy, a boy who is into music and dancing.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the Air Buddies poster, he is seen wearing sunglasses. However, he does not wear them at all in the live-action movies. The same is true pertaining to the poster for the [[Treasure Buddies|sixth film]].\n* Notably, B-Dawg retained his original voice actor longer than any other Buddy, as Skyler Gisondo voiced him from [[2006]] to [[2012]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nBdawg 1600x1200.jpg\nSnow buddies bdawg.jpg\nNormal B-Dawg s.jpg\nBDawg Card.jpg\nAir-buddies-disneyscreencaps.com-382.jpg\nSuper Buddies B-Dawg.jpg\nB-Dawg wearing sunglasses.jpg\nb-dawg.jpg\nB-Dawg eating out of bowl.jpg\nBDAWG CleoCatraDL.png|B-Dawg under the power of the collar of Cleocatra\nB-Dawg with his siblings.jpg\nSpooky Buddies B-Dawg.jpg\nSpace Buddies B-Dawg.jpg\nSanta Buddies B-Dawg.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Air Bud}}\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Air Bud characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Superheroes]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]"
