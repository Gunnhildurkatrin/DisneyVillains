It is known for its magical ink, but it is one of the few aquatic creatures that isn't willing to comply with the [[Mermaids (Peter Pan)|mermaids]]. [[Jake (Pirate)|Jake]] tries to find the squid to gather ink for [[Cubby]]'s map in the special \"[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates: Never Land Rescue|Jake's Never Land Rescue]]\". When Jake asks it to spare some of its magical ink, this instead sends the squid into a rage and chases Jake through the the sea.\n\nLuckily, [[Flow the Dolphin|Flow]] helps Jake swim away from the squid as it pursues them, where they trick it into swimming into a narrow surface which causes the squid to get caught between a rock pillar. With the animal safely incapacitated, Jake gets close enough to the squid to tickle it into releasing some of its magical ink. However, the squid manages to break free and swims away, but spares Jake due to its uncontrollable state of laughter.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\ngold squid emerges.png|The squid comes out of hiding.\nsquid says no way.png|The squid refuses to give any ink.\nAngrysquid.png\nsquid clap.png\nAngrysquid03.png|The angry squid starts to chase Jake and Flow.\nAngrysquid02.png\nAngrysquid04.png\nSquid stuck.png|The squid gets stuck.\nsquid look.png\nSquid laugh.png\nSquid ink release.png|The squid discharges a cloud of ink.\n</gallery>\n\n{{Jake and the Never Land Pirates}}\n[[Category:Jake and the Never Land Pirates characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Sea Monsters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Cephalopods]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
