They first appeared in ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Alice in Wonderland]]''===\nWhile [[Alice]] is chasing after the [[White Rabbit]] after being shrunk, she runs into a flower garden where she meets a large group of beautiful flowers. During her attempt to befriend them, the child flowers exclaim they can sing and want to sing about themselves, but the red rose (the leader) says they will sing \"[[All in the Golden Afternoon]]\" which is about all of them. After the song, they try to figure out what kind of flower Alice is. When she replies that she isn't one, they determine that she is a weed and change their attitude towards her, at which they chase her out of their garden violently. She tries to get her own back by telling them that she would pick them all if she was her normal size, and two daffodils respond by soaking her with water, sending her further away from their garden. They aren't shown again for the rest of the film and cease to exist when Alice wakes up at the end.\n\n===''[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates]]''===\nThe tiger lily makes a cameo in the ''Jake and the Never Land Pirates'' episode ''[[Grandpa Bones]]''.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n{{Alice in Wonderland}}\n[[pt-br:Flores do Pa\u00eds das Maravilhas]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Alice in Wonderland characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Plants]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Jake and the Never Land Pirates characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Disney Sorcerer's Arena Characters]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]"
