Just as the short begins, Bumble ends up getting pursued by instrument flowers preparing to catch him while trying to escape from the noisy environment. Just as he frantically flies through the flowers with piano keys for petals, the keys transform into a snake-like monster preparing to eat him, but Bumble manages to dodge him, separating the keys together just as Bumble tries to escape from the music. Bumble ends up getting caught in the cage formed by keys, so he shakes the cage in anger, causing the keys to form into butterflies chasing him. As Bumble is still being pursued by the frenzy such as trumpets and piano hammers, he dodges the keys falling off a river. Just as he escapes, he jumps on the keys to fix the piano at the end of the segment.\n\n==[[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Disney Parks]]==\nBumble appeared in the opening unit of the former [[Happiness is Here Parade]] at [[Tokyo Disneyland]].\n\n==Trivia==\n*Bumble changes colors throughout the segment, which are from purple, red, and green.\n\n{{Melody Time}}\n[[Category:Bees]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Melody Time characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]"
