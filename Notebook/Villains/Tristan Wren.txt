He is a [[Mandalorian]] human and is [[Sabine Wren|Sabine's]] brother.\n\n==Background==\nTristan Wren, brother of rebel [[Sabine Wren]], is a capable yet conflicted warrior. Along with his clan, he aligned with the [[Galactic Empire|Empire]] following the occupation of [[Mandalore]], and blamed his sister for her role in its fall. But after a clash with [[Gar Saxon]] on Krownest, he now stands with his sister in defiance of Imperial tyranny.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Sabine having a sibling was an idea the ''Rebels'' producers had since during initial development of the show, but they originally intended for her to have a twin sister called Sacha Wren. They eventually changed her sibling's gender and considered introducing him earlier as The Protector of Concord Dawn, but he was replaced by the new character [[Fenn Rau]].\n*Early in development, Tristan's name was Jona Wren.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"180\">\nLegacy of Mandalore 23.jpeg\nSWR_Sabine_Returns_Home.jpg\nLegacy of Mandalore 22.jpeg\nSWR Mandalorians.png\nLegacy of Mandalore concept 4.jpeg\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*{{Interwiki|https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/6/64/Favicon.ico|starwars|Tristan Wren|Wookieepedia}}\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Star Wars}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Star Wars Rebels characters]]\n[[Category:Warriors]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Star Wars: Forces of Destiny characters]]"
