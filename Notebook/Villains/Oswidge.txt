A rather clumsy sorcerer who usually wreaks havoc with his spells rather than being useful. It was revealed in the episode \"[[Sorcerer Material]]\" that he never really went to sorcerer school, he just worked in the cafeteria.\n\nUncle Oswidge loves to eat and presents a rather unkempt appearance. Like his younger niece Fang, he secretly likes to play with dolls. His favorite foods are ham and \"Nut Logs\" - he cannot resist them. His knowledge of magic and magical items, and most other things, surpasses the rest of the family.\n\n== Trivia ==\n*His name is a pun on Oz, as in \"Wizard of Oz\", considering he's a wizard, but he doesn't know real magic.\n*Some kids mistakenly believed Oswidge should have been ruling [[Udrogoth]] instead of [[Candy Barbarian|Candy]]; mistaking him for the King's brother. \n*One of his spells was \"hydrogen peroxide\", which is actually a disinfectant.\n\n==Gallery==\n\n{{Gallerylink}}\n{{Dave the Barbarian}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT: Oswidge}}\n[[Category:Wizards]]\n[[Category:Dave the Barbarian characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Bugs]]\n[[Category:Frogs]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Uncles]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
