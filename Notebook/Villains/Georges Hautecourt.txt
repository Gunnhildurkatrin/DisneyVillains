Sounds like a gang of swinging hip cats!|Georges Hautecourt to Adelaide}}'''Georges Hautecourt''' is a minor character in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[1970]] animated feature film the ''[[The Aristocats]]''.\n\n==Background==\n\n=== Personality ===\nNot only is Georges an old friend to [[Madame Adelaide Bonfamille|Madame Bonfamille]]; he also works with her in a more official capacity as her lawyer. Despite his old age, he does appear to be fairly competent in terms of law. Due to his old age, he can be slightly eccentric at times, doing such things as mistaking [[Duchess]]' tail for Madame Bonfamille's hand. In general, he is fairly friendly and is noted to have a liking for music.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[The Aristocats]]''===\nGeorges is summoned to [[Madame Adelaide Bonfamille|Madame Bonfamille]]'s house early in the film. Refusing the elevator, he has [[Edgar Balthazar|Edgar]], Madame's butler, escort him up the staircase. After a rather eventful climb, he begins a meeting with Madame Bonfamille. Though he initially believes he is suing someone, he soon learns that Madame Bonfamille simply wishes to create her will. Due to her lack of living relatives, Georges initially believes Madame Bonfamille will leave her fortune to Edgar but is soon corrected when she reveals her intentions to leave it to her cats, with Edgar inheriting after their lifespan is complete. Unknown to either of them, Edgar is listening in and determines a plan to remove the cats, so that he may inherit first.\n\nAt the end of the film, Georges is summoned back to the mansion to alter the will by removing Edgar, who apparently left. (Edgar's kidnapping of the cats, as well as his subsequent defeat, remain unknown to either.) Madame reveals to him that she has adopted the alley cat [[Thomas O'Malley]], alongside her own cats. In addition, Georges soon learns that Madame Bonfamille has started a foundation for the [[Alley Cats]] of Paris after hearing music and comparing it to a \"gang of swinging hepcats.\"\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\nGeorges Hautecourt\u00a0appears as a small cameo with\u00a0[[Madame Adelaide Bonfamille|Madame Bonfamille]] in the ''[[House of Mouse]]'' series.\n\n== Trivia ==\n*He bears a strong resemblance to [[Geri]], who is a well-known minor character in the [[Pixar]] universe. There are theories that Georges and Geri are the same person.<sup>[http://moviepilot.com/posts/2890244-the-pixar-character-that-disney-invented-decades-ago?lt_source=external,manual <nowiki>[1]</nowiki>]</sup>\n*The car that Georges drives resembles a [[1913]] [[Wikipedia:Mercer (automobile)|Mercer 35J Raceabout]].\n*After Edgar suggests they take the elevator up, George\u2019s declines, claiming that elevators are for old people, yet Georges himself is an elderly person.\n*Georges is credited as \"Lawyer\" in the beginning credits.\n\n==Gallery==\n\n=== Screenshots ===\n<gallery widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nGeorges Hautecourt 3.png|\"Whoops!
