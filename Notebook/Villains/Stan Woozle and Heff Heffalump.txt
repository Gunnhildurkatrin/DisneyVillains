They are also one of the many cartoon parodies of George and Lennie from John Steinbeck's ''Of Mice and Men''.\n\n==Role in the series==\nIn \"[[The Great Honey Pot Robbery]]\", Stan appears to be calm, devious, sneaky, and somewhat intelligent, while Heff appears to be loud, easily scared, idiotic and cowardly. When the two are foiled by [[Roo]] (whom Heff thinks is a giant mouse) the first time, Stan decides to go to a friend of his named [[Wooster]], a gigantic [[Woozles|woozle]] who Stan and Heff lead to [[Winnie the Pooh|Pooh]]'s house where \"brunchfast\" is about to start. Leading Wooster to Pooh is what Stan hopes will get he and Heff what they want, but when Pooh befriends Wooster and foils them a second time (just like the first time when Roo stopped them), Stan flees with Heff and vows that they will return and take their honey, one way or another (other than simply asking for it).\n\nIn \"[[A Bird in the Hand]]\", Stan and Heff come up with a plan to capture [[Kessie]] and hold her for ransom (that being honey). After capturing Kessie and [[Rabbit]] and taking them to their hideout, Stan is the one who sends Pooh, [[Tigger]], and [[Piglet]] a ransom note.\n\nWhen they too are captured, Kessie convinces Stan and Heff to start taking care of her. Kessie's constant demands result in a flood of honey in the thieves' hideout and Stan's begging to take Kessie far away from them. This was his and Heff's last appearance.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Heff mistakenly thinking Roo is a giant mouse is a reference to the ''Looney Tunes'' cartoons starring [[wikipedia:Sylvester (Looney Tunes)|Sylvester]] and [[wikipedia:Hippety Hopper|Hippety Hopper]].\n* In both their appearances, they both met Pooh, Tigger, Rabbit, and Piglet.\n*Being a [[Woozles|woozle]] and a [[Heffalumps|heffalump]], Stan and Heff fulfill the original idea that heffalumps and woozles were monstrous thieves that took honey without a second thought, as seen in the song and dream sequence \"[[Heffalumps and Woozles]]\" from ''[[Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day]]''. Their motives (at least Heff's anyway, him being a heffalump) would be counteracted in ''[[Pooh's Heffalump Movie]]'', in which heffalumps (especially [[Lumpy]] and [[Mama Heffalump|his mother]]) are portrayed as kind, misunderstood quadrupeds who believed that Pooh and his friends were the real strange creatures that dwelled in the forest.\n*Though there had already been heffalumps in the [[Hundred Acre Wood]] before, as seen with the heffalump family in the episode \"[[There's No Camp Like Home]]\" from ''The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh'', Stan is the first physical woozle to be seen in the ''[[Winnie the Pooh (franchise)|Winnie the Pooh]]'' universe, with [[Wooster]] as the second. All other woozles seen up until that point were nightmarish depictions dreamt up by the characters. They would continue to be nightmarish figures after Stan and Wooster, due to the lack of anymore physical woozles, and Heff Heffalump is the fourth funniest Heffalump is about to be seeing ''[[Winnie the Pooh (franchise)|Winnie the Pooh]]'' universe, same thing as all heffalumps seen with there dreamily thoughts of learning the difference about not to do anymore bad ideas unless they'll understand.\n*Heff has no family but was only shown himself on his picture frame.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nUTB.jpg|Stan and Heff under Pooh's bed\nStanw42.jpg\nHoneyrobbery07.jpg\nStanw58.jpg\nHoneyrobbery09.jpg\nStanw75.jpg\nStanw83.jpg\nStanw85.jpg\nHoneyrobbery.jpg\nStanws6.jpg\nStanws14.jpg\nStanws15.jpg\nHeff in abird in the hand.jpg\nStanws16.jpg\nStanws24.jpg\nStanws28.jpg\nStanws35.jpg\nStanws47.jpg\nStanws49.jpg\nStanws63.jpg|Stan and Heff's Defeat\n</gallery>\n\n{{Winnie the Pooh}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Winnie the Pooh characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Elephants]]\n[[Category:Weasels]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Toys]]\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Mobsters]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters with disabilities]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]"
