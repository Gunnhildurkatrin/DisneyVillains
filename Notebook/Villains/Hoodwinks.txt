They can be confused with Christmas tree globes, as that's what they can shape-shift into when they are scared and feel they need to hide. As the Rompkins took their tree they reside in they are scared of them. After the misunderstanding was made clear that the Rompkins would never hurt anyone, the hoodwinks befriend them. They later assist at Chrysta's Wassalia party.\n\nThey next appear in \"[[The Mystic Isles: A Hero for the Hoodwinks]]\" seeking Clover's help. Three wee sprites were bothering them. After Clover \"solved\" the problem, they praise his heroics. This episode further shows that the group's members have different personalities. While most Hoodwinks praise Clover, Halt is not sure about him, wanting proof that he's a Protector. Hidey admires Clover so much that she claims herself to be the number 1 fan of a number one super star. She even puts on bunny accessories. She is also the one to write the whole song herself. At the end of the episode, two hoodwinks claim Clover to be their Protector and give him a medal of honor.\n\n{{Sofia the First}}\n[[Category:Sofia the First characters]]\n[[Category:Shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]"
