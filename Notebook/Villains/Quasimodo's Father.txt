He also seemed to be particularly harsh when he ordered his wife to silence him, trying to get him to \"shut up\". This could either hint that he (like other people) was disgusted by his deformity and did not consider him his child, or this may have been because of the circumstances of their situation at the time.\n\n{{The Hunchback of Notre Dame}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:The Hunchback of Notre Dame characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Romani characters]]\n[[Category:Widows/Widowers]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:French characters]]"
