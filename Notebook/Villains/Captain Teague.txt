He is [[Jack Sparrow]]'s father and a former Pirate Lord of Madagascar, retiring from the position and becoming the Keeper of the [[Pirata Codex|Pirate's Code]].\n\n==History==\n===Background===\nTeague was once the most feared pirate in the world, and as such, receives respect and fear from all of the pirates in the [[Brethren Court]]. At one point, Teague was the Pirate Lord of Madagascar but later resigned to become the Keeper of the Pirate Code, the Pirata Codex, which he keeps with him at [[Shipwreck Cove]]. At some point in time he had an affair with a [[Jack Sparrow's Mother|woman]] who would go on to give birth to Jack Sparrow. After her death, he would turn her into a shrunken head.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]''===\n{{Quote|It's not about living forever, Jackie. The trick is living with yourself forever.|Captain Teague to [[Jack Sparrow]]}}\nCaptain Teague seems to be the new master of the [[Prison Dog|jailhouse dog]] that was last seen on [[Pelegosto]] about to be devoured by the natives. Teague explains the dog's apparent escape to [[Pintel and Ragetti]] by merely shrugging his shoulders and commenting, \"Sea turtles, mate\" mirroring to how his son Jack lies about his escape from the rumrunners' island.\n\nHe firmly believes that the Pirate Code is law and will kill anyone who claims otherwise, which happens in the film when, at the Brethren Court, the first mate of the Pirate Lord of India, [[Sri Sumbhajee Angria]], says to \"Hang the code\" (colloquially saying to \"ignore\" the code). Teague immediately guns him down, silencing him from further disrespect and slander. Despite his gruff demeanor, he does have a sense of humor as well as musical skill though he said recently he forgets some tunes when on his ship, and he does seem to be fond of his son, calling him \"Jackie\". During a conversation with Jack, who asks about his mother, Teague shows him a shrunken head. Jack then comments, \"She looks great!\".\n\nJack references the fact that Teague has \"seen it all, done it all\", hinting that Teague has experienced a great deal during his pirating career. Likewise, his crew seems to be made up of older pirates. It is possible that Teague was at one of the three previous meetings of the Brethren Court (he seems to have an awareness of how the meetings go), or has fought in a battle or war of the like that the current Brethren face. He also seems to have a knowledge of immortality as he warns his son \"It's not just about living forever, Jackie, the trick is living with yourself forever.\" He may be lonely as he spends his time at Shipwreck Cove and it appears his wife died at some point in the past, possibly killed by Amazonians or Melanesians who shrunk her head, which he carries with him everywhere. It is clear that his relationship with his son is strained, highlighted by Jack's negative facial expression when Barbossa calls for Teague.\n\n===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides|On Stranger Tides]]''===\nAfter Jack escaped from St James's Palace, he was chased through the streets of London by the Royal Guards under King George's tyranny. Just as one of the soldiers aimed his musket at Jack, he was shot in the back by Teague. Later, inside the Captain's Daughter pub, Teague gave Jack a significant amount of information about the [[Fountain of Youth]]. When Jack asked him, \"Have you ever been there?\", Teague sarcastically replied, \"Does this face look like it's been to the Fountain of Youth?\". Teague then vanished when Jack looked away.\n\n===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales|Dead Men Tell No Tales]]''===\nTeague's only appearance is during a flashback during a young Jack Sparrow's encounter with [[Captain Salazar]] who has a strong hatred against pirates. At some unknown circumstance, Teague ended up on the ''Wicked Wench'' where he ended up as a crew member of Captain Morgan. During battle, many of the crew members died due to Salazar's plan, alongside the ship's captain, Morgan.\n\nJack manages to take control of the ship, planning to defeat Salazar. Later, Teague, Jack, and the surviving crew watched Salazar's defeat. Teague stood behind Jack when several crew members praise Jack for his victory, alongside Teague.\n\n==Other Appearances==\n===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Price of Freedom]]''===\nIn this book it was shown that Teague lived on Shipwreck Cove with a teenaged Jack and the prison dog long before the events of the first film.\n\n===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Battle for the Sunken Treasure]]''===\nIn the opening cavern sequence of this ride, the skeletal corpses of the Brethren Court members can be seen sitting at a table, Teague being one of them. It is unknown how they died or what they were doing on [[Treasure Cove]] which lead to their apparent deaths.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Teague being played by ''Rolling Stones'' member [[Keith Richards]] is a meta-joke on how [[Johnny Depp]] based his characterization of Jack Sparrow on the mannerisms of Keith Richards, having the mentality that pirates were the rock-stars of the 18th century.\n*Captain Teague's wardrobe appears to be based off of the original Captain of the Wicked Wench from the [[Pirates of the Caribbean (attraction)|Pirates of the Caribbean]] ride. This having been a representation of [[Blackbeard]].\n**It is possible that the name \"Edward Teague\" was based off \"Edward Teach\" which was the most reputed alias of Blackbeard. Teague's clothing and facial hair are similar to written accounts of Blackbeard's appearance.\n*Strangely in ''[[LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean: The Video Game]]'', Teague does not appear in the game at all, despite his important role in the third and fourth films.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\">\n226px-Captainteague.jpg|Captain Teague in ''At World's End''\nCaptain Teague.jpg\nDSF - Stitch with the Codex.jpeg|A [[Stitch]] as Captain Teague pin\nPirates3-disneyscreencaps.com-12535.jpg\nAWETeaguebeforeshowingMum.jpg\nPirates3-disneyscreencaps.com-12494.jpg\nTroubadour.JPG\nTeague-jack-prison-dog.jpg\nCap.Teague-OST.png\nEdwardTeague.png\nTeagueTalkstoJack.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Pirates of the Caribbean}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Teague, Captain}}\n[[Category:Pirates of the Caribbean characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Captains]]\n[[Category:Sailors]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Articles with Wikipedia content]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:English characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]"
