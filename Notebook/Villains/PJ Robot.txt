He joined and became the newest PJ Mask member instead of being the villain's sidekick.\n\n==Background==\nThe PJ Robot was originally invented by [[Romeo]] as part of a plan to infiltrate HQ. Romeo intentionally made PJ Robot cute and friendly, knowing the heroes would like him and take him to HQ. However, PJ Robot began to genuinely like the [[PJ Masks (team)|PJ Masks]] too, and eventually doublecrossed Romeo to join them.\n\n===Personality===\nPJ Robot is very friendly and energetic and expresses his emotions by changing the digital face on his head.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nThe PJ Robot is shaped like an egg, colored in white with a coral red trim design.

The PJ Robot has an aqua-colored digital face and wears white gloves on its hands.\n\n==Trivia==\n*His origins is never revealed in the episode \"[[Wacky Floats]]\" until the episode \"[[PJ Robot (episode)|PJ Robot]]\".\n**His actual first appearance is \"[[PJ Robot (episode)|PJ Robot]]\".\n\n*The shape of PJ Robot's body is a reference to the character [[EVE]] from the film ''[[WALL-E (film)|WALL-E]]''.\n\n*The facial expression on PJ Robot is almost similar to the 2005 Cartoon Network character Robotboy.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\">\nPJ Robot Concept Art.jpg|PJ Robot's concept art\nPJ Robot.png\nSeries 2 - PJ Robot - Personality.jpg\nPJ Robot 1.png\nPJ Robot stats.png\nFirst appearance of PJ Robot.jpg\nGekko and PJ Robot hug.jpg\nPJ Robot hearing that the PJ Masks really need him!.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{PJ Masks}}\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:PJ Masks characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
