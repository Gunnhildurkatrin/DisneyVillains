His other abilities include flying, telepathy and general magic use. It is not known which planet he comes from but he mentions that he used to play a game like soccer there, the only difference being the use of magic.\n\n{{W.I.T.C.H}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Runics, The}}\n[[Category:W.I.T.C.H. characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]"
