She is [[Queen Delightful]]'s long-time friend, who comes to [[Jollywood]] to celebrate her graduation from Hoity-Toity Tech. But while on the way, she is transformed into a frog by [[Hildy Gloom]], who thinks Princess Prettyhead has a prettier head than she does. Then the princess decides to get back at her, and she accidentally turns everyone in Jollywood into frogs instead of Hildy. That made Princess Prettyhead the only one who could undo the frog spell. The 7D had to receive kisses from her in order to break the spell.\n\n==Appearance==\nPrincess Prettyhead wears a pink, purple and white dress with long arm length gloves.
