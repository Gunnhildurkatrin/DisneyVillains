She is the forger of [[Dimensional Scissors]] and one of the members of the Magic High Commission.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality and Traits===\nHekapoo is normally laid-back and something of a trickster toward beings she considers to be lesser than herself. She tends to be somewhat cocky and condescending at times as well, coming off as a little neurotic. As the creator of dimensional scissors, however, she takes her job very seriously and becomes deeply offended when someone steals or abuses them. Not only does she create the scissors; she also presents them to those who rightfully earn them. Her trials in earning a pair involve\u00a0having her opponent try to blow out the flame above her head, which is easier said than done.\n\n===Physical Appearance===\nHekapoo has pale white skin, long red hair with bangs that cover her right eye, orange eyes, pointed ears, and yellow-orange horns. She primarily wears a yellow-orange ballgown, brown high-heeled boots, and a black tiara. A small orange flame constantly burns over her head.\n\n==Trivia==\n*It is revealed in \"[[Running with Scissors]]\" that the Dimensional Scissors that Pony Head gave to Star belonged to Hekapoo, and Pony Head stole them.\n*Hekapoo's name is sometimes spelled by series crew members and other sources as \"Heckapoo\".\n*According to ''[[Star and Marco's Guide to Mastering Every Dimension]]'', Hekapoo was created by [[Glossaryck]] to allow Mewmans to traverse the different dimensions of the multiverse.\n*In \"[[Running with Scissors]]\", [[Pony Head]] says that Hekapoo left her scissors in the bathroom at the bounce lounge, indicating that Hekapoo has spent/spends time at the bounce lounge.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\">\nRunning With Scissors 13.png\nHekapoo laughing.png|Hekapoo laughing\nRunning With Scissors 14.png|\"That's rich.\"\nRunning With Scissors 15.png\nRunning with Scissors 11.png|Hekapoo with her clones\nRunning with Scissors 12.png\nStarcrushed-4.png\nNight Life 5.png\nNight Life 6.png\nNight Life 7.png\nNight Life 9.png\nNight Life 10.png|Hekapoo slaps Marco round the head\nNight Life 1.png\nNight Life 2.png\nNight Life 4.png|\"Err.
