She is\u00a0[[Gabriella Montez|Gabriella Montez's]] mother. Not much is known about her husband, Gabriella's dad, except for the fact that he taught Gabriella how to waltz when she was a little girl. She is one of the few characters who instantly approve\u00a0[[Troy Bolton]]\u00a0and Gabriella's relationship, unlike her daughter's friends. She apparently moves a lot with her job because it was after she was transferred to\u00a0[http://high-school-musical.wikia.com/wiki/Albuquerque,_New_Mexico Albuquerque], [[New Mexico]] that her daughter was soon reunited with Troy after they sang together. She also attended the\u00a0Scholastic Decathlon match\u00a0between\u00a0[http://high-school-musical.wikia.com/wiki/East_High East High]\u00a0and\u00a0[http://high-school-musical.wikia.com/wiki/West_High West High]\u00a0but was forced to leave the room when\u00a0[[Taylor McKessie]]\u00a0(Gabriella's best friend) and Gabriella purposely created a stinky chemical reaction in order for Troy and Gabriella to make the callbacks on time. However, she also saw her daughter sing\u00a0[http://high-school-musical.wikia.com/wiki/Breaking_Free Breaking Free]\u00a0with Troy right after that and was very proud of her for it. She is also very proud of Gabriella being accepted to Stanford University as seen in\u00a0[[High School Musical 3]]\u00a0as they had been talking about it since her daughter was little. However, Gabriella says that it was embarrassing to her that her mother wouldn't stop talking about it.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[High School Musical]]\n*[[High School Musical 2]]\u00a0(mentioned only)\n*[[High School Musical 3: Senior Year]]\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{High School Musical}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Montez, Mrs.}}\n[[Category:High School Musical characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]"
