She is the daughter of Queen Avery, and according to her, has traveled a lot with her mother.\n\n==Role in the Series==\nIn her debut appearance \"[[Scrambled Pets]]\", She was with her mother taking a tour of [[Royal Preparatory Academy|Royal Prep]] given by [[Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather]]. When she saw one of the pets running by, Queen Avery thought her daughter was seeing things, and while they were still touring the school, she saw [[Clover]] flying and [[Crackle]] hopping. Her mother thought she was making it up, but when they touring the gym, she saw the [[Freedo]] peacock with the others. When she heard what [[Sofia the First (character)|Sofia]] and her friends did and got their pets back to normal, she decided she'd be happy going to Royal Prep.\n\nShe returns in \"[[Princess Adventure Club]]\", unsure how to make friends since she always travels and was taught by tutors. After a suggestion from Sofia, she forms the club with the same name to make friends and learns from Sofia that it's not nice to exclude others after excluding Amber from the club for hurting her feelings.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Fiona Bishop not only provides the voice of [[Meg and Peg]] but also the voice of [[Miles Callisto|Miles]]' older sister, [[Loretta Callisto|Loretta]] in ''[[Miles from Tomorrowland]]''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nScrambled-Pets-32.png\nScrambled-Pets-25.png\nScrambled-Pets-45.png\nSofia the First - Princess Adventure Club4.jpg\nSofia the First - Princess Adventure Club3.jpg\nSofia the First - Princess Adventure Club1.jpg\nAmber and Sofia and Zooey.png\nSofia the first - When It Comes To Making Friends.jpg\nPrincessZooeyClub17.png\nPrincessZooeyClub16.png\nPrincessZooeyClub12.png\nPrincessZooeyClub9.png\nPrincessZooeyClub8.png\nPrincessZooeyClub7.png\nPrincessZooeyClub6.png\nPrincessZooeyClub4.png\nPrincessZooeyClub3.png\nPrincessZooeyClub2 decoy.png\nPrincess Zooey tells Princess Amber this Club is Full.PNG\nPrincess Zooey wants to know What Happened.PNG\nForever Royal 46.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Sofia the First}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Zooey}}\n[[Category:Sofia the First characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Princesses]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]"
