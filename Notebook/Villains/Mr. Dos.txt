Headquarters in ''[[Special Agent Oso]]'', who tells the special assignments Oso needs to accomplish.\n\n==Appearance==\nThis character holds a non-physical face, unlike the rest of the characters. It appears to be a digital and circular navy blue screen with two horizontal lines that vibrate as it speaks. The speaker seems to have a deep booming voice.\n\n==Biography==\nMr. Dos serves as U.N.I.Q.U.E.'s leader and supervisor to Oso. He isn't physically seen and only speaks to Oso in his watch, as his true identity is presumably a mystery. Whenever Oso fails a training exercise upon hearing a special alert from  [[Paw Pilot]], this is when Mr. Dos comes in and speaks to Oso about the situation the child is in and gives Oso a special assignment to help the child complete the task they're unable to do, if it is helping Joe borrow a dinosaur book for his class or helping Oliver and Theo turn on their flashlight. When Oso completes the assignment, Mr. Dos awards him a digi-medal for it before Oso breaks the 4th wall and awards the digi medal to the viewer on also helping them complete the assignment.\n\n==Trivia==\n*He is based on M, James Bond's supervisor though M is physically shown and isn't a mysterious figure.\n*Mr. Dos could also be based on Charlie Townsend from Charlie's Angels, as they're also a mysterious unseen figure giving tasks.\n{{Special Agent Oso}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dos, Mr.}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Special Agent Oso characters]]\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Playhouse Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Unseen characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]"
