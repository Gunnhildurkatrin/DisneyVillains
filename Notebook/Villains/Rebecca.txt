She is [[Lucky (101 Dalmatians)|Lucky]]'s second love interest in the series and another girlfriend of his. She is only seen in the episode \"[[DeVil-Age Elder]]\".\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[101 Dalmatians: The Series]]''===\nRebecca lives with her parents as a carriage hound in DeVil Ville, a Renaissance town run by [[Judge Dimsdale De Vil]], one of [[Cruella De Vil]]'s ancestors, who was cruel and unfair to the citizens. One time, a witch named Hester Hen came to the town and cursed the town for it to only appear every 100 years, and for everyone to forever be happy. The only ones that didn't fall under the curse were chickens, Hester's favorite animal.\n\nDuring a picnic, [[Roger Radcliffe|Roger]] and [[Anita Radcliffe|Anita]] end\u00a0up in DeVil Ville and were hypnotized to not want to leave, as well as the pups. While [[Lucky (101 Dalmatians)|Lucky]] was hypnotized, he became close to Rebecca. [[Spot Chicken|Spot]] broke the curse on Lucky, [[Rolly]], and [[Cadpig]] by kissing them (since she was a chicken and not subject to the curse), and then kissed Rebecca. She then realized how cruel Dimsdale was, and helped the pups find him to save Roger and Anita from being imprisoned.\n\nAfter the Dearlys were freed from the curse by Spot's kisses, the town began to vanish again. Although Lucky wanted Rebecca to come home with him, hinting some genuine affection, she refuses because she had to protect her world from its wicked DeVil, as Lucky should be with his. Lucky then left the town with everyone else, and the [[Dalmatian Puppies|pups]] had no memory of that day.\n\n==Trivia==\n*She somewhat resembles a spotted version of [[Oddball]], except that her spots are heart-shaped.\n*She is one of Lucky's three love interests in the series, the other two being [[Two-Tone]] and [[Dumpling]].\n*She speaks with a prominent Scottish accent, a likely homage to the stage musical [[wikipedia:Brigadoon|Brigadoon]], which \"DeVil-Age Elder\" is based on.\n*She is the only prominent and/or vocal Dalmatian in the series to have no apparent relation to [[Pongo]] or [[Perdita]], not even by adoption.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" position=\"center\">\nRebecca 001.png\nRebecca 002.png\nRebecca 003.png\nRebecca 004.png\nRebecca 005.png\nRebecca 006.png\nRebecca 008.png\nRebecca 011.png\nRebecca 014.png\nRebecca 015.png\nRebecca 016.png\nRebecca 019.png\nRebecca 021.png\nRebecca 023.png\nRebecca 026.png\nRebecca 027.png\nRebecca 029.png\nRebecca 033.png\nDvlAgEldrDL (992).png\nRebecca 035.png\nRebecca 036.png\nRebecca 038.png\nRebecca 040.jpg\nRebecca 041.png\nRebecca 042.png\nRebecca 043.png\nRebecca 044.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{101 Dalmatians}}\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:101 Dalmatians characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
