She is one of [[Marina]] and [[Stormy]]'s various dolphin companions. Her vocal effects are provided by [[Dee Bradley Baker]].\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates]]''===\nFlow first appears in the episode ''[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates: Never Land Rescue|Jake's Never Land Rescue]]''. When Jake asked Marina and Stormy how to restore [[Cubby]]'s map, the young mermaids told him that only the magical ink of the [[Golden Squid]] was capable of doing so. To reach the Squid, the young mermaids summoned Flow to escort Jake through the depths of the Never Sea. All the while, Jake wore a snorkel shell to enable him to breathe underwater.\n\nWhen Jake and the dolphin reached the squid, Jake asked the creature if it would lend any ink for the map. Alas, it only made the squid angry and chase after the two. But the dolphin proved to be much faster and outran the squid. When the squid got stuck between the rocks, Flow moved Jake close enough to tickle the squid with her tail fluke. The squid laughed so hard, it released a trail of ink.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nJakeMarinaStormy-Jake's Never Land Rescue.jpg\nFlowChatter.png\nDolphinleap.png\nfish in hurry.png|Those fish sure are in a hurry.\nflowhalt.png|Jake and Flow spot something up ahead.\njakenervous.png\nJake- jake's never land rescue06.jpg|Flow and Jake confront the Golden Squid.\nSquid says no way.png|The squid becomes vexed.\nAngrysquid.png|The squid tries to grab Flow and Jake.\nCatch Flow if u can.png\nFlow chase.png\nFlowtickle.png|Flow tickles the squid with her tail.\nFlow map restore.png\nSavethemagic.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Jake and the Never Land Pirates}}\n[[Category:Jake and the Never Land Pirates characters]]\n[[Category:Dolphins]]\n[[Category:Marine Animals]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
