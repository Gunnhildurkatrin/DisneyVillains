He is voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]<ref>http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/American-Dragon-Jake-Long/Councilor-Kulde/</ref>.\n\n==History==\nCouncilor Kulde is the Dragon of Norway and the administer of the Dragon test: Judgment in fire. Like [[Councilor Andam]], he believes [[Jake Long|Jake]] has much potential as a dragon. This most likely stems from the fact that Jake once sacrifices his own victory to save [[Fred Nerk]] when he is captured by the [[The Dark Dragon|Dark Dragon]], even though Jake knows that if he loses he would lose Lao Shi as a teacher. Initially, Kulde's color scheme was mostly just blue, while later it was mostly a pinkish purple.\n\n==Apprentices==\nKulde may have an apprentice or partner, as he is seen doing the fall of faith with a young orange dragon<ref>[[Keeping Shop]]</ref>. Other dragons also did this with their partners or apprentices. Lao Shi did it with Jake.\n\n==Episode Appearances==\n===Season One===\n*\"[[Dragon Summit]]\" (first appearance)\n*\"[[The Halloween Bash]]\"\n===Season Two===\n*\"[[Being Human]]\"\n*\"[[The Hong Kong Longs]]\" (final appearance)\n\n==Trivia==\n*Kulde appears to be a phonetic spelling of the word \"cold\".\n*Kulde breathes ice instead of fire.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery bordercolor=\"transparent\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nCouncilorKulde2.jpg\nKulde old.gif|Kulde in human form promotional artwork\nKulde_old1.gif|Dragon Kulde\nKulde.jpg|Kulde in human form (Season 2)\nKulde1.jpg|Dragon Kulde (Season 2)\nDragon_Councilors.jpg\nDragon Summit (32).jpg\nDragon Summit (33).jpg\nDragon Summit (71).jpg\nDragon Summit (83).jpg\nscreenCapture 14.02.14 13-50-16.jpg\nscreenCapture 14.02.14 13-51-00.jpg\nscreenCapture 14.02.14 13-51-25.jpg\nscreenCapture 14.02.14 13-51-40.jpg\nscreenCapture 14.02.14 13-53-17.jpg\nscreenCapture 14.02.14 13-53-28.jpg\nscreenCapture 14.02.14 13-53-41.jpg\nscreenCapture 14.02.14 13-54-03.jpg\nscreenCapture 14.02.14 13-54-28.jpg\nscreenCapture 14.02.14 13-54-44.jpg\nDragon Summit (87).jpg\nDragon Summit (91).jpg\nDragon Summit (92).jpg\nDragon Summit (93).jpg\nDragon Summit (94).jpg\nDragon Summit (110).jpg\nDragon Summit (112).jpg\nDragon Summit (113).jpg\nThe Halloween Bash (79).jpg\nThe Halloween Bash (81).jpg\nDragon Council real mad at Jake Throwing a Party.jpg\nDragon Council walks and talking about Master Jake Under Control.jpg\nScreenCapture 28.03.14 12-38-50.jpg\nScreenCapture 28.03.14 12-43-36.jpg\nScreenCapture 28.03.14 12-44-53.jpg\nChar 35875.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n<references/>{{DEFAULTSORT:Kulde}}\n\n{{American Dragon: Jake Long}}\n[[Category:American Dragon: Jake Long characters]]\n[[Category:Dragons]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
