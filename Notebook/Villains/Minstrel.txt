He is the minstrel of [[King Stefan's Castle]] and is shown to love wine.\n\n\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nMinstrel is mainly shown to love wine and music. He is shown to be drunk, so he probably often becomes very drunk behind [[King Stefan]]'s back and is also shown to like his musical performances.\n===Physical Appearance===\nMinstrel is shown as a slender man with light brown hair. He is shown to have a slender long pointy nose and darker eyebrows than his hair. He shown to wear a yellow and orange (only with the strpies) shirt with a black color that matches his tunkhose. He is often shown holding his banjo.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Sleeping Beauty]]''===\nAs [[King Stefan]] and [[King Hubert]] wait for [[Aurora]] to return, Hubert feels like celebrating and summons the Minstrel to serve them wine and play music for them as they [[Skumps|sing and toast]]. He secretly helps himself to a few drinks and ends up getting drunk and falls asleep under the table with his feet sticking out and his head inside the mandolin.\n\nLater, when the [[Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather|fairies]] put everyone in the [[King Stefan's Castle|kingdom]] to sleep, Merryweather spots him after regaining consciousness, only to be put back to sleep by a wave of Merryweather's wand. Afterwards, Minstrel isn't seen again for the rest of the film. However, it can be assumed that he possibly wakes up from his slumber after [[Maleficent]]'s demise and [[Prince Phillip|Prince Philip]] kissed Aurora, which breaks Maleficent's curse and awaken the whole citizens of the kingdom.\n\n===''[[Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: Follow Your Dreams]]''===\nThe Minstrel makes a possible appearance in the first segment of the film. A person similarly dressed and with an almost similar appearance (though with green stripes instead of orange) is seen when [[King Hubert]] is seen rushing out of the castle, telling him about his speech and his preparations, sighing in relief after Hubert gets into the carriage he is taking, along with Stefan and [[Queen Leah|Leah]]. Later, when Hubert is trying to look for the speech for the royal conference, Minstrel told him that the king requested Hubert to deliver his in five minutes. When Hubert comes out of the room, he asked someone \"five minutes\". But when he pushes the door aside, he didn't know that he accidentally crashed Minstrel. Afterwards, Minstrel is not seen again.\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nsleeping-beauty-disneyscreencaps.com-4607.jpg\nsleeping-beauty-disneyscreencaps.com-4611.jpg|The Minstrel helps himself to a drink\nsleeping-beauty-disneyscreencaps.com-4636.jpg\nsleeping-beauty-disneyscreencaps.com-4665.jpg\nsleeping-beauty-disneyscreencaps.com-4689.jpg\nsleeping-beauty-disneyscreencaps.com-4693.jpg\nsleeping-beauty-disneyscreencaps.com-4750.jpg\nSleeping-beauty-disneyscreencaps.com-4765.jpg\nsleeping-beauty-disneyscreencaps.com-4818.jpg|Filling his mandolin with wine\nsleeping-beauty-disneyscreencaps.com-4824.jpg\nsleeping-beauty-disneyscreencaps.com-4832.jpg\nsleeping-beauty-disneyscreencaps.com-4847.jpg\nsleeping-beauty-disneyscreencaps.com-4854.jpg|Down the hatch\nsleeping-beauty-disneyscreencaps.com-5039.jpg|Drunk with the mandolin on his head\nEnchanted-tales-disneyscreencaps.com-387.jpg|thumb|The Minstrel's possible appearance in ''[[Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: Follow Your Dreams]]''\n</gallery>\n\n{{Sleeping Beauty}}\n[[Category:Sleeping Beauty characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Servants]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:European characters]]"
