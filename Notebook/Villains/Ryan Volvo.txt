[[Anna Coleman|Anna]] was\u00a0not\u00a0ready for Tess and Ryan to get married because of this. At the rehearsal dinner, Tess (in Anna's body) tells Anna (in Tess' body) to ask Ryan if he could postpone the wedding, because Tess did not want Anna to go through getting married in her own body. After Anna's friends, Maddie and Peg, try to get Tess (in Anna's body) to go to the band at The House of Blues, Ryan tells her to go and perform. During the toast, Anna (in Tess' body) accepts him for who he is, because he was only trying to make Tess happy\n\nAt the wedding, Ryan and Tess (including a few other guests) dance underneath a wedding tent.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"185\">\nFreaky Friday Ryan 1.jpg\nFreaky Friday Ryan 2.jpg\nFreaky Friday Ryan 3.jpg\nFreaky Friday Ryan 4.jpg\nFreaky Friday Ryan 5.jpg\nFreaky Friday Ryan 7.jpg\nHarry Coleman and the Audiences.png\nFreaky Friday Ryan 8.jpg\nFreaky Friday Ryan 9.jpg\nFreaky Friday Ryan 10.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Freaky Friday}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Volvo, Ryan}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Freaky Friday characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Stepparents]]"
