"\n[[File:Croppedimage318436-bumbumghignointera.png|thumb|250px]]\n'''Bum Bum Ghigno''' is a character created by Corrado Mastantuono. Bum Bum Ghigno is a rotund man who dresses in overalls and a red chequered shirt. He also has protruding front teeth, similar to [[Goofy]], and thick black eyebrows.\n\n==History==\nBum Bum Ghigno is a general layabout with no permanent profession, even if he officially works as a whitewasher. He is frequently seen in various short-timed jobs, but his laziness and clumsiness prevent him from holding them for long. In his first appearance he was an antagonist to [[Donald Duck]] and [[Gyro Gearloose]], but has since become their friend.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nBum.jpg\nBum_Bum_Ghigno.jpg\nBum_bum_ghigno_2.jpg \n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Wikipedia|List of Donald Duck characters}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ghigno, Bum Bum}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]"
