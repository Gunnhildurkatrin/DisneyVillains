They tell them that Camp Wilderwood has fifty Enchanted Activities and over five hundred Enchanted Plants and Animals such as Itching Ivy. When\u00a0[[Sofia the First (character)|Princess Sofia]] points out that her brother [[Prince James]] is standing on some Itching Ivy, Marty makes the piece vanish while telling him, \"I thought we cleared all the Itching Ivy from this area. Sorry.\" Marty and Maple spend the majority of the time announcing the various activities and showing and telling the campers how to do them. When they announce the Inter-camp Flag Race, Camp Wilderwood's flag gets stolen. They announce the flag's disappearence before allowing the Race to start. During the race, James and [[Wendell Fidget]]\u00a0are revealed to be the flag thieves and they are using the flag as their sail. Marty asks Maple, \"Isn't that the missing camp flag?\" but Maple lets it slide, stating, \"I suppose I shouldn't let them get away with this. But we're winning.\" When James and Wendell win the race, Marty tells them to ask next time they want to use the flag. Marty and Maple then call everyone to the Mess Hall for cookies.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Marty is the first male fairy to appear on the show.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Sofia the First}}\n[[pt-br:Marty e Maple]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Sofia the First characters]]\n[[Category:Fairies]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]"
