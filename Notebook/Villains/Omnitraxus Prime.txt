He is the master of space-time and one of the members of the Magic High Commission.\n==Background==\n===Personality and Traits===\nOmnitraxus Prime is arrogant, somewhat goofy, and callous. He bears an intense hatred of monsters and their supporters and will go to any lengths to ensure their subjugation, though he does feel a little remorse for the way they were treated.  He is willing to assist people with space-time-related problems if he feels the matter is worth his attention.\n\n===Physical Appearance===\nOmnitraxus Prime is a giant humanoid-like being with a skull-shaped face, a body made up of space. As the largest member of the Magic High Commission, his great size likely prevents him from entering normal public places, so he usually appears alongside his allies via a crystal ball.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Omnitraxus's name is similar to that of [https://warner-bros-characters.fandom.com/wiki/Optimus_Prime Optimus Prime], the leader of the Autobots in the ''Transformers'' franchise. [[Peter Cullen]] has voiced the character since 1984, although he has also been voiced by\u00a0[[David Kaye]].\n*According to ''[[Star and Marco's Guide to Mastering Every Dimension]]'', Omnitraxus was created by [[Glossaryck]] to maintain the multiverse for Mewmans and explain to them the delicate strands of space-time.\n*Despite the fact that he hates monsters he seemed to felt a little remorse for the way they were treated and tried to convince Festivia to treat them good unfortunately she listened more to Hekapoo.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nButterfly Trap 7.png\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*{{Interwiki|https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/star-and-the-forces-of-evil/images/6/64/Favicon.ico|starvstheforcesofevil|Omnitraxus Prime|Star vs. the Forces of Evil Wiki}}\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Star vs. the Forces of Evil}}\n[[Category:Star vs. the Forces of Evil characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Immortal]]\n[[Category:Those brought back to life]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
