His spots are immaculately patterned to the constellation \"Little Dipper,\" thus giving him his name (this is not official, though, and he's claimed to be named this since he has similar spots to his father's, as well as a black tip on his tail). He also has a blue collar (both in cartoon and live-action) like his father, Dipstick, and his brother, Domino.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[102 Dalmatians]]''===\nLittle Dipper first appears as a newborn puppy along with [[Oddball]] and [[Domino]]. He is later seen when Oddball attempts to get \"spots\" from a wet black inkjet copier, after she notices that she doesn't have any spots, when she is suddenly flung out the window, but is seen hanging on to the windowsill. Little Dipper and Domino go out and try to save her, to which they succeed. Little Dipper is later shown when Kevin and Chloe go on a date and he and his family are left watching TV. [[Jean-Pierre Le Pelt]] then kidnaps him, his siblings, and his mother. Little Dipper is not shown for the rest of the movie, but makes a small appearance at the end of the film with Domino.\n\n===''[[102 Dalmatians: Puppies to the Rescue]]''===\nDespite being one of Dipstick and Dottie's pups, Little Dipper does not appear in the video game, ''102 Dalmatians: Puppies to the Rescue''. However, he did appear in the Game Boy Color version at the start of the game and at the end as the puppy filling up the screen.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Like Domino, some of his cliparts are inconsistent. Some feature him wearing a red collar, some feature him with a blue collar, and some feature him with white paws that contradict other cliparts.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Stock Art===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"180\">\nGiugigig.jpg|Clipart of Little Dipper with Domino and Oddball\nLdd.jpg|Clipart of Little Dipper playing with Oddball and Domino\nDvv.jpg|Little Dipper sleeping on Domino\nScdf.jpg|Clipart of Little Dipper and his family\nLittle_Dipper.png|Clipart of Little Dipper\n102-dalmatians-coloring-pages-24.jpg\n102-dalmatians-23-coloring-pages-7-com.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nDottie.jpg|Little Dipper and his brother [[Domino]] at the beginning of the movie with their sister [[Oddball]] and mother [[Dottie]]\n102-dalmatians-disneyscreencaps.com-2536.jpg|Little Dipper\u2019s back legs & tail seen next to his father [[Dipstick]]\n102-dalmatians-disneyscreencaps.com-2551.jpg\nChloe 102 Dalmatians 3.jpg\n102-dalmatians-disneyscreencaps.com-2736.jpg\n102-dalmatians-disneyscreencaps.com-2746.jpg\n102-dalmatians-disneyscreencaps.com-2894.jpg\n102-dalmatians-disneyscreencaps com-3990.jpg\n102-dalmatians-disneyscreencaps_com-4095.jpg\n102-dalmatians-disneyscreencaps_com-4097.jpg\n102-dalmatians-disneyscreencaps_com-4099.jpg\n102-dalmatians-disneyscreencaps_com-5224.jpg|On the floor with Domino.\n102-dalmatians-disneyscreencaps_com-5228.jpg\n102-dalmatians-disneyscreencaps_com-5229.jpg\n102-dalmatians-disneyscreencaps.com-6724.jpg\n102-dalmatians-disneyscreencaps.com-6821.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nmSle3xYW0Z9sDbHWCszbiyw.jpg|Little Dipper Pin\n102 dalmatians book.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{101 Dalmatians}}\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:101 Dalmatians characters]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:English characters]]"
