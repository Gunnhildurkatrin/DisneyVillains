She is a fairy godmother in training who hails from the Motherland and arrives in the real world to help Mackenzie Walsh, a single mom facing a midlife crisis.\n==Background==\n=== Personality===\nEleanor comes from the [[Motherland]] and thus, has been surrounded by magic and wonder all her life. She naively believes that all happy endings follow a formula that must be adhered to. When she comes to the real world, she is struck with reality. Nevertheless, she maintains an optimistic attitude to get her through the day. Eleanor comes off as eccentric to those who do not know her, yet despite having magical powers, does not know how to use them properly. She fails to understand basic human necessities such as phones and cars, but seems open to accepting them rather quickly. Eleanor came off as selfish when Mackenzie learned that she wanted to help her just so she could keep her magic and prevent the school from shutting down, but she does genuinely care about her friends and looks to help anyone regardless.\n===Physical Appearance ===\nEleanor has blond hair and dons a basic pink fairy dress. However, she is shown sporting a plaid coat over her clothes, which she seems to like.\n\n==Powers and Abilities==\nEleanor possesses typical fairy magic such as flying, albeit limited, and can transform and materialize certain objects. These evidently have mixed results. At one point it seemed as if she had transformed the Walshes' dog Bingo into a piglet. However, it turned out she just transported him away and somehow created a pig in his place. It seems that in order for her magic to work efficiently, she needs to try unconventional methods such as using a watermelon, rather than a pumpkin, to create a carriage.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nEleanor animation.jpg|Eleanor animated\nEleanor concept art.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n* Eleanor is embarrassed by her middle name \"Fay\", as opposed to her more ridiculous sounding last name \"Bloomingbottom\".\n*It is hinted that Eleanor has never seen her reflection before, as seen in one scene where she opens a car mirror in Mackenzie Walsh's car. However, this could simply be because she did not expect to see a mirror in the first place as she had never been in a car before.\n\n[[Category:Godmothered]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Fairies]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Teachers]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
