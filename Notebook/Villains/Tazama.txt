Unlike her teammates, she does not seem to actively fight when the guard is in battle, instead staying off to the side and keeping watch for her teammates. This, however, is by no means a sign of cowardice as Tazama does this not to ensure her own safety by so she may keep watch over her teammates when they are fighting, fitting given she is the guard\u2019s keenest of sight. Because this role of her\u2019s in battle, Tazama is considered a valuable member of the guard and her teammates greatly appreciate her aid. Tazama also seems to be the least aggressive of Vitani\u2019s Lion Guard, as she does not smile as much as they do in battle and while she did insist that her team was the rightful Lion Guard she was not as demanding or vocal about as her other teammates were.\n\nTazama also seems to be the most intelligent of Vitani\u2019s guard. She has shown cunning and intuition when dealing with obstacle. During the contest to decide which team would be the true guard, she cleverly created a challenge where she could use her species\u2018s inherent ability to see in the dark in order to defeat Anga. This shows that she uses situations to her advantage and that she aware of talents her species has that others do not, showing that is knowledgable. Tazama, like the rest of her guard shows strong camaraderie with her teammates and does her best to support them showing that she is a true and loyal friend to them.\n\n==Role in the Series==\nTazama appears in the series finale \"[[Return to the Pride Lands]]\".\n\nAs [[Kion]] and his team are heading back to the [[Pride Lands]], the group only finds out that they have been replaced by a new group led by [[Vitani]]. There, Vitani did not recognize Kion at first upon taking a look at the lion with a scar on his face, to which the feud is halted when [[Kiara]] arrives and explains that [[Kovu]] is accepted into [[Simba]]'s pride.\n\nFurthermore, Tazama is present participating during the Battle of the Lion Guards to which she competes against the martial eagle [[Anga]] to know who has better keen. Tazama, however, wins after finding Laini inside the dark area. After Kion allows Vitani to win during the contest, Vitani's Guard suddenly wins against Kion's team. Kion then masters the power of the [[Roar of the Elders]] while Tazama and the rest of Vitani's Guard celebrate when Vitani uses the Roar of the Elders the first time. Afterwards, Tazama continues remaining as a member of Vitani's Lion Guard as the new protectors of the Pride Lands just before Kion and his friends return to the [[Tree of Life (The Lion Guard)|Tree of Life]].\n\n== Relationships ==\n\n=== Friends ===\n===[[Vitani]]===\nVitani and Tazama are good friends.
