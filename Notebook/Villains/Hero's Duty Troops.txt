The troops are commanded by [[Sergeant Calhoun]], and lead by [[General Hologram]].\n\n==Members==\n<tabber>T.J. Calhoun=\n{{main|Sergeant Calhoun}}\n|-|General Hologram=\n{{main|General Hologram}}\n|-|Markowski=\n{{main|Markowski}}\n|-|Kohut=\n[[File:Kohut_WIR.jpg|200px|left]]\nKohut is a marine and apparently Sergeant Calhoun's most trusted trooper, as well as her closest ally. He is first seen during the in-game Cy-Bug battle with the other troopers. Afterwards, he and the other troops meet Felix and learn that Ralph and a baby Cy-Bug have accidentally been sent out of ''Hero's Duty'' via escape pod.\n\nKohut, Felix, and Calhoun travel to Game Central Station and learn from the [[Surge Protector]] that Ralph entered ''Sugar Rush'' in the shuttle. Calhoun realizes she must journey into ''Sugar Rush'' and eliminate the Cy-Bug before it multiplies. At this time, Felix asks Kohut if Calhoun's always as intent as she is, prompting Kohut to explain Calhoun's tragic backstory.\n\nIn the end, Kohut is seen again at Calhoun and Felix's wedding. \n\nKohut was voiced by Brandon Scott.\n{{-}}\n|-|FPS TV monitor Robot Avatar=\nThis robot-like character represents the player character's avatar. Since this is a first-person shooter game, the avatar for some reason is a robot with the soldiers' arms that drives on caterpillar treads and has a TV monitor for a face that shows whoever is playing this game (in this case, the [[Moppet Girl]]'s). Whenever the game is not turned on, the robot's \"face\" shows the words \"offline...\"\n{{-}}\n|-|Dr. Brad Scott=\n[[File:Brad_WIR.jpg|200px|left]]\nDr. Brad Scott was Calhoun's first love interest and would-be husband until he was eaten by a Cy-Bug on their wedding day, therefore fueling the shattered Calhoun's sadness and bitter nature. One thing that really upsets Calhoun about the tragedy was the fact that Dr. Scott called her a \"dynamite gal\", something which caused her terrible flashbacks when Felix called her the same thing.\n\nThe ''Hero's Duty'' prequel comic expands on his character immensely, revealing that he was the original inventor of the Cy-Bugs, having designed them as an adaptable toy that would learn from how their owners played with them. However the company he worked for, the A-Toy Corporation, immediately saw the military applications and despite his protests, chose to start weaponizing the Cy-Bugs on a remote planet. When things went wrong, he chose to stay and help contain/destroy his creations and fell in love with Calhoun in the process.\n\nBrad was voiced by [[Tim Mertens]] in the US version, and by Nick Grimshaw in the UK version.\n{{-}}\n</tabber>\n\n==Role in the film==\nThe troops of the ''[[Hero's Duty]]'' game are given the important task of eradicating the dreaded [[Cy-Bugs]] that are native to their game, as their programming is glitched so they can't tell the difference between actual game-play and real life, making them truly villainous and extremely dangerous. A group of troops can first be spotted in [[Game Central Station]], roaming about together after hours.\n\nLater on, one of the soldiers, Markowski, gets his armor stolen by a bad-guy named [[Wreck-It Ralph (character)|Wreck-It Ralph]], from the game ''[[Fix-It Felix Jr. (video game)|Fix-It Felix Jr.]]'', who sneaks into ''Hero's Duty'' in an attempt to win the [[Medal of Heroes]], believing it'd declare him a good-guy. At the time Ralph sneaks in, the troops are preparing for some game-play. Once the game begins, the troops rush into battle and are unable to guess through Ralph's disguise, despite his inability to blend in with the other troops as far as bravery goes.\n\nAfter the game was through, the troops meet Fix-It Felix Jr., who's searching for Ralph. Their leader, Sergeant Calhoun, claims she hasn't seen him when a mysterious sound comes from ''Hero's Duty'' Tower, where the Medal of Heroes is located. Before the troops can make it to the tower, they are nearly run over by a passing escape shuttle, which Ralph and a baby Cy-Bug accidentally gets trapped in, sending them to the kart racing game, ''[[Sugar Rush]]'', forcing Calhoun and Felix to travel there to both find Ralph and eradicate the Cy-Bug before it multiplies.\n\nIn the end, the troops are lastly seen at Calhoun and Felix's wedding ceremony, as they fell in love over their adventure together and on their own. They, along with other soldier characters, were training their weapons on the church window for potential Cy-Bug attack just in case.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nHero's Duty troops.jpg|The Troops with Calhoun.\nWreck-it-ralph-disneyscreencaps.com-2107.jpg|The Robot Avatar\nWreck-it-ralph-disneyscreencaps.com-2333.jpg|The Robot Avatar offline.\nWreckitralph 4269.jpg\nHerosDutySoldierRyanLang.jpg|Concept art of soldier's armor by Ryan Lang.\nDrBradScott.jpg|Brad models by Ryan Tottle.\nHero's -Duty- Troops.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*The Hero's Duty Troops are seem to be a cross between the [http://starcraft.wikia.com/wiki/Marine Marines] from the ''[[w:c:starcraft:StarCraft|StarCraft]]'' series and [http://starshiptroopers.wikia.com/wiki/Mobile_Infantry_%28UCF%29 Mobile Infantry] from ''[[Starship Troopers]]''.\n\n{{Wreck-It Ralph}}\n[[Category:Wreck-It Ralph characters]]\n[[Category:Military characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Soldiers]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Armies]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Disney Sorcerer's Arena Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]"
