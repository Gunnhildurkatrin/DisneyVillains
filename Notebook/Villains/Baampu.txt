He is broad and portly with a large head, a round middle, and skinny legs. Like most warthogs, his tusks are white and his hooves are black, with his nose being a pale pink. His main shade is dark blue, contrasting Pumbaa's red, and his stomach is navy, almost black. His mane and tail tip are both chestnut in color, while his eyes are small and dark.\n\n===Personality===\nBaampu is the polar opposite of Pumbaa. Dim-witted, gruff, and quiet by nature, he is much less perky than his good-natured companion. He is not too deep the thinker and would rather accept the beliefs of others than give his own explanations for the phenomenons of the world. In addition to being a silent presence, Baampu is rarely bothered by personal intrusions, giving hardly a reaction to a stranger's prying. He makes friends quite easily, as he was willing to accept [[Timon]] as his new best friend almost immediately.\n\nAround [[Monti]], Baampu comes alive, turning into a loud mouthed jokester with an opinion of his own. His reunion with Monti also reveals him to be oblivious to the feelings of others, as he walks off with Monti without giving Timon a second thought. He does, however, seem to genuinely care about his best friend, as he remembers many memories from their time together in the past.\n\n==Role in the series==\n===Backstory===\nBaampu is a warthog who lived near the [[Hakuna Matata (location)|jungle]]. It is unknown if he lived within the boundaries of the jungle or in a surrounding area. He and his best friend Monti accidentally lost touch.\n\n===\"[[Kenya Be My Friend?]]\"===\nWhen Timon is in need of a new best friend, he seeks out another warthog to replace Pumbaa. Among a group of other animals, Baampu is spotted, and Timon proceeds to question the warthog about his name, reaction to predators, and affiliation with \"Bestest Best Friend Day.\" Pleased with what he hears, Timon declares Baampu his new best friend.\n\nLater that night, the two are stargazing, and Baampu questions Timon about the \"sparkling dots\" in the sky. Timon declares them to be fireflies, and Baampu, satisfied by his new friend's answer, falls into silence. Although the warthog is content, Timon is upset that Baampu does not show as much interest in the stars as Pumbaa.\n\nThe following morning, Baampu and Timon run into Monti and Pumbaa at the watering hole. Surprised to see each other, Baampu and Monti greet each other. In their haste to reestablish their friendship, they forget about Timon and Pumbaa and walk off into the grasslands together.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nBampuu.jpg\nInspectbampuu.png|Timon inspects Baampu\nStargazebampuu.png|Baampu and Timon stargaze\nPersonalitybampuu.png|Baampu reflecting his friendlier nature when around Monti\nFriendsbampuu.png|Baampu reunites with Monti\nLaughbampuu.png|Baampu and Monti share a laugh\nIdeabampuu.png|Monti proposes an idea to Baampu\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Baampu's name is pronounced \"bahm-poo.\"\n*\"Mpu\" has no meaning in Swahili, but \"baa\" means disaster.\n*\"Baampu\" is an anagram of \"Pumbaa\".\n*His name is mispelt \"Bampu\" on the Disney+ captions.\n\n{{TheLionKingWiki}}\n{{The Lion King}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Timon & Pumbaa characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Warthogs]]"
