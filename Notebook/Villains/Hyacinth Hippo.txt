She is a hippopotamus who appears in the segment ''[[Dance of the Hours]]''. She represents the hours of noon day.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Fantasia]]''===\nHyacinth Hippo is the lead of the dancers of the daytime and symbolizes Laura Adorno of the opera. This is deduced by the fact that she is wooed by [[Ben Ali Gator]] (who symbolizes Enzo Grimaldo) and by her deep sleep, as in the opera Laura also is sent into a deep sleep.\n\n===''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''===\nShe makes a couple of cameo appearances in the film. Her only line is \"Oh, excuse me,\" when she passed [[Eddie Valiant]]. When she sat on a bench to have lunch, it broke due to her sheer mass, sending a person already sitting on it flying up into the atmosphere, but several people helped her up. She, along with half of the ''Fantasia'' cast and [[Dumbo (character)|Dumbo]], are on loan to Maroon Cartoons from Disney.

She had a few appearances specifically in the episode \"[[Ladies' Night]]\" where she acts as the club's temporary bouncer and whenever [[Mortimer Mouse]] arrives, she jumps on him, which is the episode's running gag.\n\n===''[[Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas]]''===\nHyacinth and her hippo friends were part of [[Daisy Duck]]'s skating act in the segment \"Bells on Ice\".\n\n===Cameos===\nHyacinth made a cameo in the ''[[Bonkers]]'' episode \"[[Cartoon Cornered]]\".\n\nIn ''[[The Lion King 1\u00bd]]'', Hyacinth was seen sitting next to [[Lady]] and [[Tramp]] during the film's final scene as a silhouette in the theater.\n\nA Hyacinth Hippo statue can be seen in the museum in the [[DuckTales (2017 series)|''DuckTales'' reboot]] Season 3 episode, ''[[Louie's Eleven!]]'' where Louie plans to crash Glamour's party so the Three Caballeros can perform.\n\nHyacinth Hippo will make a cameo in an upcoming short of ''[[Chip 'n' Dale: Park Life]]''.\n\n==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==\n[[File:Hyacinth hippo.jpg|thumb|250px|Hyacinth Hippo at [[Walt Disney World]].]]Hyacinth Hippo appears in various parades as a walkaround character.
