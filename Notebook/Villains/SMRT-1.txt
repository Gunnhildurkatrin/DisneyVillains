I'd like to play a game with you|SMRT-1 introducing himself}}\n\n'''SMRT-1''' was a robot character found at [[CommuniCore]]'s Computer Central area at [[EPCOT Center]].\n\nHe served as a demonstration of voice-recognition technology, allowing him to interact with guests and conduct simple question and answer games, with a series of telephones surrounding him allowing guests to talk to him. SMRT-1 was removed in 1994 as part of CommuniCore's transformation into [[Innoventions]].\n\nAfterwards, SMRT-1 would be relocated to the Concourse Steakhouse at [[Disney's Contemporary Resort]], where he was renamed <strong>X1846 </strong>and reconfigured to serve as an interactive greeter that could also serve drinks. He would be removed sometime in the year 2000, supposedly due to technical malfunctions.\n\nAs one of the park's few characters at opening, SMRT-1 was featured in assorted merchandising and marketing materials for Epcot and was seen as the unofficial mascot of the CommuniCore area.\n\nStrangely, in the EPCOT Center Opening Celebration television special, SMRT-1 was referred to as female by a visiting robot, and was given a much higher pitched voice than the one he actually had in the park.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nSmrt-1 Concept Art.jpg|Concept Art\nSMRT-1 Promo Poster.jpg|Print Ad by Sperry for Epcot featuring SMRT-1\nSMRT-1 Ad 2.jpg\nContemporary SMRT-1.jpg|The Contemporary Resort version, named X1846\nSMRT1 Magnet.jpg\nBuzzyornament.jpg|On an Epcot Christmas ornament\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Former Epcot attractions]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
