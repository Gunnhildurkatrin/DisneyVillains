He is a large snake who is part of [[Jack Skellington]]'s plan to take over Christmas, which only caused a disaster in the real world until Jack saved [[Santa Claus (The Nightmare Before Christmas)|Santa Claus]] to help him undo the mistake he did.\n\n==Background==\nThe Attic Snake is a large snake with an orange and black pattern to represent the common colors of Halloween.\n\n==Role in the film==\nIn the film, the Attic Snake is first seen during the song \"[[Making Christmas]]\" where it was being prepared for [[Jack Skellington]] to take over Christmas; here, it is seen being fed by the Corpse Father who attempts to feed him a skull, but ends up getting swallowed by the snake though he manages to free himself though.\n\nLater when Jack takes off to deliver the Christmas presents to the real world, the Snake is deployed into one of the children's rooms where he slithers around a white Christmas tree with red ornaments which suddenly starts getting swallowed, as a child fearfully reacts to his tree being swallowed by the Snake. \n\nLater at the end of the film when Jack manages to defeat [[Oogie Boogie]] and save [[Santa Claus (The Nightmare Before Christmas)|Santa Claus]] to help him undo the wrongdoings he did, the Snake is then taken away along with the rest of the toys Jack mistakenly gave to the children during Christmas as it is shown that Santa is replacing all the Halloween toys frightening children with Christmas toys in order to make them happy.\n\n==Disney Parks==\n===[[Haunted Mansion Holiday]]===\nThe Snake can also be seen the attic of Disneyland's Haunted Mansion Holiday and Tokyo's Haunted Mansion Holiday Nightmare. In both versions of the attraction, he is seen holding the Naughty and Nice list as well as swallowing a present. He is also one of the stretching portraits in the Holiday version of the Haunted Mansion.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Despite his short amount screen time in the film, the Snake is sporadically featured in certain merchandises inspired by Tim Burton's ''The Nightmare Before Christmas''.\n\n{{The Nightmare Before Christmas}}\n{{The Haunted Mansion}}\n[[Category:Snakes]]\n[[Category:The Haunted Mansion characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:The Nightmare Before Christmas characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Touchstone characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]"
