"[[Image:Push HKDL.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Hong Kong Disneyland's Push the Talking Trash Can]]\n\n'''Push the Talking Trash Can''' is a radio controlled robot that made occasional rounds throughout [[Disneyland Resort]] in [[Anaheim]], [[California]], [[Tokyo Disneyland]] in [[Japan]], [[Disneyland Paris]] in [[France]] and [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] and formerly in Tomorrowland in the [[Magic Kingdom]] at the [[Walt Disney World]] in [[Lake Buena Vista, Florida]], \n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Push_with_characters.jpg|thumb|250px|Disneyland's Push the Talking Trash Can gets a hands-on examination by [[Captain Hook]], [[Alice]], [[Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum|Tweedledum]], and [[Mad Hatter|The Mad Hatter]] near the entrance to [[Tomorrowland (Disneyland)|Tomorrowland]]. The building in the background is the Plaza Inn restaurant at the edge of Main Street USA.]]\n\nPush is an actual Tomorrowland trash bin so named because of the large word \"PUSH\" found on either flap. The radio control system is hidden by the bin's regular steel liner and plastic trash bag should a guest peer inside.\n\nThe robot is discretely operated by a pair of cast members in plain clothes, one with a remote control unit who operates the movement of the robot and the other who provides its voice. (Sci-Fi from Six Flags was operated in the same manner.) The transmitter is hidden inside a large gym bag carried by one of them wherein a voice processor changes the second cast member's voice to a high-pitched, nasal register. Since they are within about 20 feet of the robot, they are able to make Push interact directly with guests and other cast members who are dressed as either atmosphere or face characters.\n\nExact technical details are uncertain, but the robot appears to be propelled with the transmission, wheels and tires of a mobility scooter, the type of which Disney Theme Resorts rent in large numbers.\n\n==Similar Characters==\n[[Image:DAK-Pipa.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Pipa the Talking Recycling Bin performs at Disney's Animal Kingdom in Lake Buena Vista, Florida.]] \nA similar character, known as '''Pipa the Talking Recycling Bin''', is at [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]], appearing at [[Rafiki's Planet Watch]] and encourages guests to recycle, and a character named Wes Palm, a talking palm tree.\n{{-}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Lucky the Dinosaur]]\n*[[Muppet Mobile Lab]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Disneyland}}\n{{Magic Kingdom}}\n{{Disney's Animal Kingdom}}\n{{Tokyo Disneyland}}\n{{Disneyland Paris}}\n{{Walt Disney Studios Park}}\n{{Hong Kong Disneyland}}\n[[Category:Fantasyland attractions]]\n[[Category:Tomorrowland attractions]]\n[[Category:Disneyland entertainment]]\n[[Category:Disneyland attractions]]\n[[Category:Magic Kingdom entertainment]]\n[[Category:Magic Kingdom attractions]]\n[[Category:Tokyo Disneyland entertainment]]\n[[Category:Tokyo Disneyland attractions]]\n[[Category:Disneyland Paris entertainment]]\n[[Category:Disneyland Paris attractions]]\n[[Category:Hong Kong Disneyland entertainment]]\n[[Category:Hong Kong Disneyland attractions]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Disney's Animal Kingdom entertainment]]\n[[Category:Disney's Animal Kingdom attractions]]\n[[Category:Walt Disney Studios Park entertainment]]\n[[Category:Walt Disney Studios Park attractions]]\n[[Category:Shanghai Disneyland attractions]]\n[[Category:Shanghai Disneyland entertainment]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
