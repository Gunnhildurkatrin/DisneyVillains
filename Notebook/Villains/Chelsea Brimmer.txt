Though she only appears in a few episodes, she is shown to be a wealthy friend of [[London Tipton]]'s.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nMore so than London, Chelsea is incredibly superficial and values appearance and wealth over everything else. Because of this, she buys posh items and loves to shop with her wealthy friends. She has had multiple nose jobs and refuses to drive her own car because bugs can get into the windshield.\n\n===Appearance===\nChelsea, being wealthy, is much like London, her outfits are all designer. She has dark brown, curly hair and fair skin, her eyes are brown. Chelsea has a slim physique and often wears mini skirts. Her clothing is both similar and different from London's own.\n\n==Story==\nChelsea is first seen in \"[[Miniature Golf]]\" where she participates in London's book club, but like the other girls, is more interested in chatting about her luxurious life than actually reading the book.\n\nChelsea appears next in \"[[Who's the Boss?]]\", where she hangs out with London on several occasions, while London tries to fix up [[Lance Fishman|Lance]] to presentable at a posh formal ball. He manages to woo Chelsea at the ball, by wearing a tuxedo and combing his hair and sweet-talking her.\n\nIn \"[[Tiptonline]]\", Chelsea appears as a guest on London's ''Yay Me!'' webshow, and later becomes a producer after [[Cody Martin|Cody]] quits.\nChelsea appears in the ''The Suite Life on Deck'' episode \"[[Flowers and Chocolate]]\", where she visits London on the ''[[S.S. Tipton]]'', assuming that London is still living a wealthy fashionable life with servants and other luxuries. She later discovers that London is actually attending school there, and eventually decides not to tell anyone back home about this.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the co-star credits at the end of \"Tiptonline\", Chelsea's name is misspelled as \"Chelsa\".\n*Her father is in prison for tax evasion.\n*Her zodiac sign is Pisces.\n\n{{Suite Life}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brimmer, Chelsea}}\n[[Category:The Suite Life characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:American characters]]"
