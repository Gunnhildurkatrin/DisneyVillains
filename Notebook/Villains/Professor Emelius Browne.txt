When she, [[Charlie Rawlins|Charlie]], [[Carrie Rawlins|Carrie]], and [[Paul Rawlins|Paul]] get there, they find him as a magic salesman/con man who never truly believed in the spells he sold. After being turned into a rabbit, he tells Miss Price that he got the spells from [[The Spells of Astoroth]] and decides to make a deal with her. If she helps him with business, he'll help her find the spell. After facing a villainous [[Bookman (Bedknobs and Broomsticks)|Bookman]] and coaching the soccer game on [[The Isle of Naboombu]], they finally find it, the first time not being a success. Then he decides to leave, but goes back to help because of the [[Nazis (Bedknobs and Broomsticks)|Nazis]], finally finding the magic in him to turn himself into a rabbit. In the end, he joins [[General Teagler]] in the old home guard because he says, \"The way things are, it's much too dangerous being a civilian.\" And so, he leaves with a wave and kiss to Miss Price.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nLadies and Gentlemen.jpg|Professor Browne using magic\nBrown.jpg|\"Gather round please, ladies and gentlemen.\"\nTumblr m7opey0bcO1r32uszo1 500.jpg|Professor Browne's suitcase\nBedknobs-03.jpg\nBedknobs-broomsticks-disneyscreencaps.com-13672.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Bedknobs and Broomsticks}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Browne, Emelius}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:English characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Bedknobs and Broomsticks characters]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]\n[[Category:Military characters]]\n[[Category:Rabbits]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Deuteragonists]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Soldiers]]"
