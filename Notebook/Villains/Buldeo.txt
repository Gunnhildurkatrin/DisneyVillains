He was meant to have [[Mowgli]] to lead him to a treasure in the ruins where [[King Louie]] lives, but then Shere Khan\u00a0would show up and kill Buldeo. Mowgli would then kill Shere Khan with Buldeo's gun. Buldeo and Shere Khan were meant to sing a duet ([[The Mighty Hunters]]), but the song, along with Buldeo, were removed due to a dispute between [[Bill Peet]] and [[Walt Disney]] over the initial contents.\n\n{{The Jungle Book}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Hunters]]\n[[Category:The Jungle Book characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Deleted characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Indian characters]]"
