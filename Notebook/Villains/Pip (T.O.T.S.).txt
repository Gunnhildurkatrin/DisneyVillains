He is a T.O.T.S. baby deliverer and is [[Freddy (T.O.T.S.)|Freddy]]'s best friend and partner.\n\n\n\n==Background==\n===Appearance===\nPip is a black and white penguin. He has blue irises, a golden yellow beak and golden yellow feet. Pip wears his T.O.T.S. uniform, which is a blue shirt with white buttons. He also wears a light blue cap. When he goes to sleep, he wears pajamas and a nightcap. For Halloween, he dressed up as an ice cube.\n\n===Personality===\nWhen it comes to delivering babies, Pip is willing to lend a wing. He is the one who uses a map to find the way during deliveries. He also comes up with solutions to any troubles that pop up before or during a delivery.\nPip is the more logical one of team Pip and Freddy. He studies the T.O.T.S. instruction manual all the time. He also stresses out if the rules are not followed.\nAt times, he puts his own desires before the baby. An example was when he neglected Percy the Peacock's egg because he was focused on winning the Easter Egg Hunt.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nTime to Fly with T.O.T.S..png\nPip (T.O.T.S.).png\nPenguin Hug.png\nIMG 20200912 135635.png\nIMG 20200917 092451.png\nIMG 20201013 170459.jpg\nScreenshot 20201013-125749.jpg\nScreenshot (176).png|link=Pip (T.O.T.S.)\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*In \"[[You've Gotta Be Kitten Me]],\" he easily gets emotional.\n*In \"[[Back to Cool]],\" he has a brotherly relationship with a baby penguin named Penn.\n*In \"[[Hug-A-Pip]],\" [[Mr. Woodbird]] made a lovey for baby named Lucy that's modelled after him.\n\n\n\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{T.O.T.S.}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Penguins]]\n[[Category:T.O.T.S. characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]"
