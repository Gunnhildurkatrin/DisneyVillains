She usually wears a pink dress, a pink bow, and black mary-janes.\n\nWhen she is a superhero, her entire body was made up of chewing gum.\n\n== Personality ==\nGabby is a very polite, but promise-breaking person. She loves to chew bubble gum.\n\nGabby takes chewing gum to a new level. She's never without it. You can find her blowing bubbles while hanging upside down from a tree, while swimming at the pool, and even while getting her hair cut at the barber shop. Until finally one day her mother tells her a rule \"No more gum.\"\n\nUnfortunately, Gabby struggles a bit with self control and ends up breaking the rule which gets her into a very sticky situation.\n\nGabby is able to stop a purse snatcher with her new, sticky superpowers, but she can keep them a secret from her mother, who forbids Gabby from chewing gum.\n\n== Relationships ==\n\n=== Family ===\n\n==== Rico Gomez/Bubble Boy ====\nRico loves his sister, Gum Girl, because she is a cute superhero.\n\n==== Amy Gomez ====\nAmy loves her daughter.

Although Ninja-Rina wants her mother to win more trophies, as seen in ''Popped Star'', in which she messes up with Gum Girl by weaving her into a basket, shaping her into a vase, and even distorts her with her trophy. Gum Girl and Ninja-Rina later become friends. Later, she helps Gum Girl save everyone, even Rico, Dr. Gomez, Mrs. Gomez, Natalie, and the boy, from the Ferris wheel. She also saves her mom from pulling the key from the stand.\n\n==== [[Natalie Gooch|Natalie Gooch/Brainstormer]] ====\nNatalie bullied Gabby, and insulting her for how she looks with her at school. In ''Gum Luck'', It appeared to be that Natalie had been bullying Gabby, and so, she had actually always thought of Gabby as her friend.\n\n=== Frenemies ===\n\n==== Robo-Chef ====\nRobo-Chef wanted revenge on his baking event due to gum. His evil plan was to steal the bank and destroy Gum Girl, but his plan was foiled, got tripped by Gum Girl, and got arrested by the police for his crimes.\n\n==== Mr. Hansen ====\n\n=== Enemies ===\n\n==== The Underhander ====\nThe Underhander wanted to win the wrestling game.
