(short for '''Intelligent Outer Space Technical Assistant''') is a small robot designed and built by [[Leo Callisto]] to assist in any way. It is capable of getting into any machine, fix any glitch and straighten up any mess. However, when it malfunctions, or is poorly coded, it displays a mischievous side and can deliberately make problems go from bad to worse. It works best with specific coding as opposed to general codes, as shown in it successfully giving Loretta a complex style, but struggling with several simple styles for Miles. The I.O.T.A., despite its fickleness, is a durable robot, capable of functioning in water.\n\nThe I.O.T.A.'s main body is a small sphere with one camera eye and has five holo legs that operate as propellers, allowing it to fly and hover. Its legs and body are held together by a small cone-like projection. \n\n{{Miles from Tomorrowland}}\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n\n[[Category:Tools]]\n[[Category:Miles from Tomorrowland]]\n[[Category:Technology]]"
