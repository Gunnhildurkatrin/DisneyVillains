When she was 12, her parents passed away and she went to live with her [[Polly Harrington|Aunt Polly]] in Harrington, where her optimistic views change several of the townsfolk's lives for the better.\n\nShe was forbidden from attending a local festival, so she snuck out when she tries to re-enter her room by climbing the tree outside the window she falls, causing her to become paralyzed from the legs down. She and Aunt Polly leave Harrington with [[Dr. Edmond Chilton]] for an operation in Baltimore, which will correct her injury. \n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nPollyanna2.jpg\nPollyanna3.jpg\n</gallery>\n{{CharacterStub}}\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Pollyanna characters]]\n[[Category:Nieces]]\n[[Category:Orphans]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters with disabilities]]"
