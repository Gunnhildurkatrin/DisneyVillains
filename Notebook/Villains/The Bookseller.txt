He is the owner of a small bookshop/library in the [[Village (Beauty and the Beast)|village]] that [[Belle]] lived in. He is one of the few villagers who is genuinely friendly to Belle.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]''===\nDuring the [[Belle (song)|film's opening musical number]], Belle enters his workplace with the intention of returning a book that she had previously borrowed, she questions if there is anything new, to which the Book Seller denies, after choosing a book that she had already read twice, the Book Seller kindly gives the book to Belle as a gift and watches as Belle departs.\n\n===[[Beauty and the Beast (2017 film)|''Beauty and the Beast'' (2017)]]===\nIn the live-action remake, the Bookseller is changed to '''P\u00e8re Robert''' (French for \"Father Robert\"), the village chaplain.\n\nHe is first seen when Belle arrives at his chapel, to return a book that she had borrowed from him. Belle asks him if he has any new books, which he hasn't, but assures Belle that she could borrow one of his old ones. A few hours later, P\u00e8re Robert helps Belle pick up her laundry, which some of the villagers have thrown on the street on the orders of the headmaster after discovering Belle teaching a young girl to read.\n\nHe later appears at [[Tavern (Beauty and the Beast)|the tavern]], when [[Gaston]] arrives and Maurice accuses Gaston of having tried to kill him. When Gaston throws [[Maurice]] into the back of [[Monsieur D'Arque]]'s carriage, P\u00e9re Robert insists that Maurice is sick and needs to go to a hospital, not an asylum.\n\nAfter Belle reveals the existence of the [[Beast]], P\u00e8re Robert watches in horror as the villagers head off to kill the Beast. However, it is likely he may have had a part in helping Belle and Maurice by setting the horses to the carriage loose to buy them some time as he did not go with the mob (probably believing in Belle's claim that the Beast was not dangerous). P\u00e8re Robert later attends the ball at [[Beast's Castle|the castle]], together with the others, after the curse is broken.\n\n==Literature==\n===''[[As Old as Time (A Twisted Tale)]]''===\nIn ''As Old as Time (A Twisted Tale)'', a variation on the original film based on the idea that the [[Enchantress]] was Belle's mother, the bookseller is named 'Monsieur Levi' and is identified as not only being an old friend of Belle's mother and Belle's own godfather but is also slightly magical himself, although his only 'magic' appears to be an extremely long life as he revealed to be at least over a century old. After various other magic users were 'arrested' by Monsieur D'Arque, Levi was forced to make a deal with D'Arque where he would be left alone so long as he did nothing to help other magical beings, Levi accepting this deal so that he can keep an eye on Belle. At the novel's conclusion, D'Arque has Levi arrested and his bookshop burned down, but he is swiftly rescued when the Beast reveals the truth about D'Arque to the rest of the village.\n\n==Gallery==\n===''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]''===\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nBeauty-and-the-beast-disneyscreencaps.com-278.jpg|Finished already?\nBeauty-and-the-beast-disneyscreencaps.com-285.jpg|\"Not since yesterday.\"\nBeauty-and-the-beast-disneyscreencaps.com-288.jpg\nBeauty-and-the-beast-disneyscreencaps.com-294.jpg\nBeauty-and-the-beast-disneyscreencaps.com-296.jpg|\"That one?
