Later on, Darkwing used antidote gas on Megavolt and the rest of the Fearsome Five.\n\nUnlike the regular Megavolt, he wears larger goggles and enhanced armor acting like lights, and an electric aura emits from him.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Since \"Dangerous Currency\" was never actually approved by Disney, the story (and therefore, Super Megavolt) is considered non-canon.\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Darkwing Duck}}\n[[Category:Darkwing Duck characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Alternate Forms]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Rats]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
