"{{Infobox character\n|image = Camera_9.jpg\n|designer = Alberto Lavoradori\n|fullname = Stefan Vladuck\n|alias = Camera 9\n|occupation = Cameraman\n|home = [[Duckburg]]\n|friends = [[Lyla Lay]]}}\n'''Camera 9''' is a character from the [[PKNA]] comic book. He is a cameraman of Channel 00, who wears a camera helmet on his head. [[Angus Fangus]] calls him a robot, but it isn't clear if it's out of ignorance or Angus is just being his typical obnoxious self. The only Channel 00 reporter who treats him as a person is [[Lyla Lay]], but due to her own secret missions with the Time Police, she tends to cancel appointments with him, so Camera 9 believes Lyla thinks about him so lowly as his other co-workers do.\n\nWhat nobody knows about Camera 9 is that he once was a famed photographer, Stefan Vladuck, specialized in \"hot scenarios\". It is unknown why he retired from the scenes.\n\nWhile he is a reserved person, he can also recognize when someone else needs privacy and respects it: multiple times he helped keeping Lyla's secrets without even knowing them just out of friendship.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nStefan Vladuck.jpg|Stefan Vladuck\nStefan Vladuck smascherato.jpg|Stefan Vladuck unmasked\n</gallery>\n\n{{PKNA}}\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]"
