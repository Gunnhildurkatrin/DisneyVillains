She is Doc and Donny's mother and Mr. McStuffins' wife and works as a doctor. She sometimes has Doc to volunteer for her when there's a patient to help, either toy or person. She and Doc are both doctors and always expects Doc to become one, like herself.\n\n==Appearance==\nDr. McStuffins is slender and wears a green long-sleeved shirt and\u00a0denim jeans. She is often seen wearing a white lab coat just like Doc.\n\n==Personality==\nDr. McStuffins is mostly compassionate and motherly, but when there's a patient in need, she always remains sweet and friendly to them, if the patient is a person, but when Doc is stuck on a hard case\u00a0when there's a toy to fix, her mother always helps her with some advice or help to fix the toy.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Dr. McStuffins' real name is Maisha which we learn in ''The Big Sleepover''.
