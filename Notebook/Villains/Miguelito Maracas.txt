"[[File:Pancho4.jpg|thumb|250px]]'''Miguelito Maracas''' was to be a fourth member to ''[[The Three Caballeros]]'' group that would have appeared in a third Latin American film, ''[[Cuban Carnival]]''. However, with the Good Neighbor Program ending with World War II and ''The Three Caballeros'' losing money at the box office, the film was never made. He was designed by legendary Disney animator [[Fred Moore]].\n\nAlthough he never made an appearance in any final animated production, he made a cameo appearance in the Panchito comic \"[https://inducks.org/story.php?c=H+93085&search=Panchito%20Tim%20Artz The Mysterious El Masco]\".<ref>https://mobile.twitter.com/HenriekeDraws/status/979970871660916738</ref>\n\n==Personality==\nMiguelito, originally to represent cockfighting, was a scrappy rooster. He also owned a tobacco plantation, which was where he would meet [[Donald Duck]], [[Jos\u00e9 Carioca]], and [[Panchito Pistoles]] to begin their adventure.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nTumblr inline mmcuw5EeDL1qz4rgp.jpg\nPancho3.jpg\nPancho2.jpg\nPancho2-t.jpg\nPancho1-t.jpg\nPancho bongo.jpg\n</gallery>\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Saludos Amigos/The Three Caballeros}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Maracas, Miguelito}}\n[[Category:Deleted characters]]\n[[Category:Chickens]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:The Three Caballeros characters]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]"
