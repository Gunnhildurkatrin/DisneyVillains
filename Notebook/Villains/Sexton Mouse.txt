He complains to Friar Tuck that nobody is coming. As Little Sister gives Friar Tuck their last farthing, and he blesses them both, Sexton remarks that they were saving it for a rainy day. As the [[Sheriff of Nottingham]] enters, he rudely asks what he wants, only to be shushed by Little Sister. He is then shown in the doorway, watching the Sheriff and Friar Tuck fight, cheering for the latter, only to see the former arrest him thanks to Trigger. He then comforts Little Sister who is devastated at the sight of Friar Tuck being arrested for high treason to the crown.\n\nSexton and Little Sister are not seen again until the end of the film, where they celebrate newlyweds\u00a0Robin Hood and Maid Marian\u00a0by throwing rice down from a window after [[King Richard]] finally returns. \n\n== Trivia ==\n* Sexton is voiced by [[John Fiedler]], who also voiced [[Piglet]] in ''[[The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]'', Deacon Owl in ''[[The Rescuers]]'', and the [[Porcupine (The Fox and the Hound)|porcupine]] in ''[[The Fox and the Hound]]''.\n* [[Sterling Holloway]] was considered to voice Sexton.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nSextonmad.png\n</gallery>\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Robin Hood}}\n[[fr:Croquenote]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Robin Hood characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Mice]]\n[[Category:English characters]]\n[[Category:Clergy]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]"
