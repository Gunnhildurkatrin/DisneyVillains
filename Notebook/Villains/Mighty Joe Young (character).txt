Joe is a gigantic mountain gorilla who is adopted by [[Jill Young]].\n\n\n\n==Personality==\nJoe is always loyal and faithful but can act very violent and hot-tempered when provoked or when things go wrong.\n\n==Role in the film==\nJoe is first seen as a baby when Jill finds him in the grass and plays peek-a-boo with him until Jill's mother catches her. Joe is seen again running away from the hunters with Jill until her [[Dr. Ruth Young|wounded mother]] finds them and holds her daughter close when she was fleeing from the hunters. Before she dies, she tells Jill to take care of Joe.\n\nTwelve years later, Jill and Joe are seen again in several scenes. Eventually, Joe is sent to an animal preserve, but his peaceful residence is short-lived when he gets provoked by poachers and causes a rampage during a public interview at a party. Joe is then detained in a large prison cell, but Jill and Gregg manage to free him. He is then forced to flee when he runs into Strasser, the police and the navy, who are all out to get him.\n\nJoe is later seen in the fire-at-the-fairground scene where he has to rescue Jason, a little boy, from the Ferris wheel, but falls hard on the ground in the process and lays asleep, making Jill desperately think that he is dead. Jill tries to wake him up a few times, but nothing happens, and she falls into tears. Several minutes later, Joe slowly opens his eyes and he and Jill are reunited. Joe is then given his own wildlife habitation, where he can roam free and live in peace.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"138\">\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-23.jpg|Joe as a baby\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-78.jpg|Joe with his mother\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-89.jpg\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-679.jpg|Joe about to attack Andrei Strasser\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-706.jpg|Joe bites off Strasser's thumb and index finger\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-869.jpg|Jill holding Joe close\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-2716.jpg\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-2718.jpg\nTumblr mryf57nzgn1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-7842.jpg|Joe Close Up Angry Face When He About  To Remember \nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-9773.jpg\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-9816.jpg\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-9955.jpg\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-10019.jpg\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-10147.jpg\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-10166.jpg\nTumblr myuazrZBfa1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\nTumblr n4en9q0N8C1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-11707.jpg|Joe Started to See and Hear Jason Crying on Top of The Wheel\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-11721.jpg.webp|Joe Seeing Jason Stuck on Top of The Wheel\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-11745.jpg.webp|Joe Can't Stand and Let the Boy Get Trap on Top\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-11762.jpg\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-11805.jpg|Joe Was To Climb Up to Save Jason\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-11844.jpg\nTumblr n7ldbqd1jM1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-11987.jpg|Joe saving [[Jason]].\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-12029.jpg\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-12110.jpg\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-12120.jpg\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-12165.jpg\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-12170.jpg\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-12388.jpg\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-12399.jpg\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-12439.jpg.webp\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-12611.jpg\nMJY 1.jpg|John Alexander in the Joe suit running on the miniature set with director Ron Underwood and Joe designer & creator Rick Baker paying close attention at the monitor.\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Although Joe is the titular character, Jill is the overall protagonist since she has bigger plans. However, Joe is the one who drives the plot.\n*Due to a rare form of gigantism, Joe is 15 feet tall and 2,000 pounds.\n*According to [[Rick Baker]], the suit and design of Joe was his way of getting back at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dino_De_Laurentiis Dino De Laurentiis] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Rambaldi Carlo Rambaldi] for not letting him fully realize his ape suit concept for the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Kong_(1976_film) 1976 remake of King Kong]. He stated in several interviews that this is the suit he always wanted to make for a Kong film.\n*Since gorillas are distinct by their nose shapes, Joe designer and suit supervisor Matt Rose gave Joe \"j\" shaped nose prints.\n*Suit performer John Alexander has a number of ape roles, one of his most iconic was the silverback Digit in ''Gorillas In The Mist'', 10 years prior to ''Mighty Joe Young. ''Again, a suit designed & created by Rick Baker.\n\n{{Mighty Joe Young}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Gorillas]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:African characters]]\n[[Category:Orphans]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Mighty Joe Young characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Deuteragonists]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]"
