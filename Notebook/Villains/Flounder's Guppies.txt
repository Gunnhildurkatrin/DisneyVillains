They are the five children of [[Flounder]]. [[Ariel]] meets them when she resumes her mermaid form to search for [[Melody]]. Their names are never given, but they resemble Flounder closely enough that Ariel mistakes one of them for her friend. It is unknown if they have a living mother or where she is, as she is not at all mentioned. They last appear in the end during the song \"[[Here On The Land and Sea|Here on the Land and Sea]]\" to which they bring a whale a trumpet to blow during the celebration.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nLittle-mermaid2-disneyscreencaps.com-5378.jpg|Playing \"Kick the Clam\"\nlittle-mermaid2-disneyscreencaps.com-5353.jpg|Flounder's kids playing Kick the Clam\nlittle-mermaid2-disneyscreencaps.com-5416.jpg|The guppies following their father.\nlittle-mermaid2-disneyscreencaps.com-8057.jpg\nlittle-mermaid2-disneyscreencaps.com-5350.jpg\nlittle-mermaid2-disneyscreencaps.com-5361.jpg\nlittle-mermaid2-disneyscreencaps.com-5368.jpg|Flounder scolding his children\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Little Mermaid}}\n[[Category:The Little Mermaid characters]]\n[[Category:Fish]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Marine Animals]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
