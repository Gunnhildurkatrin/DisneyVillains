The son of [[Fritz Robinson|Fritz and]] [[Petunia Robinson]] and the brother of [[Tallulah Robinson]], he is a painter that uses a special flight pack.\n\n==Personality==\nLaszlo, like his family, appears to be rather eccentric, with his main focus on his art. He also fights with his sister, Tallulah. However, also like his family, Laszlo is shown to be a caring person who will do what it takes to protect his loved ones from harm.\n==Role in the film ==\nLaszlo is first introduced when Lewis is touring the house. Creating great paintings with his paint gun, he earns the frustration of his sister, as Laszlo has painted her hat again. Their father tells them to stop fighting to keep from waking Petunia.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nLaszloGame.jpg|Laszlo in the game\n21974_100397459997931_100000830319764_9362_1313820_n.jpg|Laszlo's portrait\nLaszlo.jpg\nTumblr_nloiqgSBpk1u3mcm9o3_1280.jpg\n</gallery>\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Robinson, Laszlo}}\n\n{{Meet-the-Robinsons}}\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Meet the Robinsons characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Artists]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]"
