She is [[Alistair Krei]]'s most trusted assistant.\n\n==Background==\nWhile not much of her character was revealed in the movie, ''[[Big Hero 6: The Series]]'' reveals Judy to have a somewhat gray and sarcastic personality. Unlike Krei's other subordinates, she does not fear her boss, even going as far as to sass him on occasion. She does not tend to worry that much for Krei every time he is in danger and mostly views them as an excuse to take time off.\n\nDespite her snarky and sometimes impartial treatment towards her boss, Alistair doesn't show much more than mild irritation. He evidently trusts Judy more than any of his other employees, even allowing her to view what was believed to be \"top secret\" information on a black market drive-in \"[[The Impatient Patient]]\". Judy knows Alistair quite well, being able to pinpoint when he's feeling uncharacteristically anxious or jealous, even when he doesn't admit it. She seems to find the latter situations to be amusing.\n\n===Physical Appearance===\nJudy has a slender figure with fair skin and red lips. Her hair is short black and her eyes are brown. She wears glasses and dresses in a white blouse and black pants with a grey jacket on top. For footwear, she wears gray high heels.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Big Hero 6]]''===\nJudy accompanied Krei to the [[San Fransokyo Institute of Technology]] Expo. She noticed [[Hiro Hamada|Hiro's]] [[Microbots]] demonstration and pointed it out to Krei, who instantly took an interest. When Hiro rejects Krei's offer to buy the bots, she looks as displeased as her boss.\n\nLater on, Judy appears on [[Fred (Big Hero 6)|Fred]]'s television, standing alongside Alistair during news coverage of Krei Tech headquarters' construction. She also appears in the security footage of [[Abigail Callaghan]]'s test flight accident and the aftermath on [[Akuma Island]].\n\n===''[[Big Hero 6: The Series]]''===\nIn the follow-up series, Judy often appears alongside Alistair, serving as both his confidante and a voice-of-reason.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Judy was a silent character in the original film. She was given a voice and speaking roles for the first time in the follow-up series. She was also unnamed until the episode \"[[Internabout]]\".\n**This would later become a\u00a0running gag where Krei constantly gets her name wrong by calling her Jodie (among\u00a0other similar names).\n**Additionally, her voice actress is credited as '''Krei's Assistant''', despite being named in the series.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nAunt Cass Goes Out 54.png\nThe Impatient Patient 35.png\nBig Problem 11.png\nThe Present (7).png\nThe Present (13).jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Big Hero 6}}\n\n[[de:Kreis Assistentin]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Big Hero 6 characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
