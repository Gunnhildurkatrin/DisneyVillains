He is a five-time rodeo champion of the [[Kokaua Town]] fair.\n\n==Role in the series==\nZach appeared in \"[[Sprout (episode)|Sprout]]\" as [[Stitch]]'s opponent in the rodeo. He is shown to be stern and firm with pride in his streak of bull riding and is not intended to lose the sixth time to Stitch.\n\nDuring the competition, Zach manages to win the rodeo with a high score to prove it. However, when Stitch shows\u00a0off his incredible\u00a0skills, Zach glares\u00a0at him. When it then looked like Stitch was going to win, Experiment 509 ([[Sprout]]) erupted and started\u00a0running rampant. When Stitch makes his way towards the real Sprout, Zach helps\u00a0him by giving him a lasso, showing a side of compassion.\n\nIn the end, Zach gives Stitch the championship cowboy belt, saying that a real cowboy either wins fair and square or he loses fair and square, showing Zach his belief in honor and fairness.\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Polynesian characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Cowboys & cowgirls]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
