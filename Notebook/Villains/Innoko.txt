A feminist, she prefers to be called a \"sha-woman\", and that women are better than men as she spoke, \"'Wise' and 'man' don't even belong in the same sentence.\"\n\n==Role in the film==\nAfter the earthquake sent by the Spirits, Nita pays a visit to the sha-woman. The sha-woman can communicate with the spirits and tells Nita that, if she wants to marry [[Atka]], she has to go with [[Kenai]] to Hokani Falls and burn the amulet that Kenai gave her in her childhood. At the end of the movie, she witnesses the marriage between Kenai and Nita and is shown to be very pleased by it.\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nBrother Bear 2 Promo 2.jpg\nBb2 120.jpg\n</gallery>\n==Trivia==\n* Although she insists that she out to be called \"sha-woman\", the word \"shaman\" was originally used to describe the clerics of Tungustic peoples, which are, in fact, usually elderly women.\n\n{{Template:Brother Bear}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric characters]]\n[[Category:Brother Bear characters]]\n[[Category:Native American characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Canadian characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Mentors]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
