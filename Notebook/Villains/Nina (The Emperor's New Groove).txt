She was [[Kuzco]]'s (then named Manco) fiancee who despite having been betrothed to him, did not like him because he was so arrogant and spoiled. However, after [[Pacha]] decided to switch places with the emperor, Nina started to fall in love with the former because she thought that \"Manco\" had finally become less selfish, while the emperor-turned-llama was with [[Mata (deleted character)|Mata]]. Sting wrote a duet for Pacha and Nina entitled \"[[One Day She'll Love Me]]\" in which the two playfully chased each other through the palace while expressing their feelings for one another.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nMark Pudleiner Kingdom of the Sun Nina 002.jpg|Sketch of Nina by Mark Pudleiner\nMark Pudleiner Kingdom of the Sun Nina 003.jpg\nPachaNinaStoryboard (2).png|Storyboards for \"One Day She'll Love Me\" by Chris Williams\nPachaNinaStoryboard.png\nNina Story Sketch.jpg|Nina with her attendants by Barry Johnson\nPachaNinaPencilTest (1).png|[[Pacha]] and Nina in a pencil test for One Day She'll Love Me\nPachaNinaPencilTest (2).png\nPachaNinaPencilTest (3).png\n</gallery>\n\n==Animation test==\n<gallery>\nMark Pudleiner - Kingdom of the Sun - Rough ' Nina ' animation test\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Emperor's New Groove}}\n[[Category:Deleted characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:The Emperor's New Groove characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Peruvian characters]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]"
