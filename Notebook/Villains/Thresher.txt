'''Experiment 544''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]]. He is designed to\u00a0smash up crops with his mace-like\u00a0tentacles. He was captured by [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]], but was rescued in \"[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]\".\u00a0\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment\u00a0544 was the 544th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to smash up crops with his mace-like tentacles,\u00a0although he can also use them to attack and battle enemies.\u00a0544\u00a0and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.\n\n544's pod eventually\u00a0made its way to a junk shop, where it, along with [[Hammerface|033]], [[Heat|609]], and [[Plasmoid|617]], was\u00a0discovered, stolen, activated, and named Thresher by [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] in \"[[Dupe (episode)|Dupe]]\".\n\nBack at [[Gantu's Ship|his ship]], Gantu trained and conditioned Hammerface, Heat, Thresher, and Plasmoid\u00a0by using [[Reuben|Experiment 625]] for target practice, much to his indignity. The four henchmen experiments were then led by Gantu in an attack on the [[Lilo's House|Pelekais' house]], where their boss ordered them\u00a0to defeat and capture [[Stitch]] and his replicas after seeing that he had been split into four.\n\nThresher\u00a0engaged one of\u00a0the clones in a duel. The clone picked up a broom\u00a0and started spinning it similar to a bo staff. While he did this in front of Thresher, the latter appeared to be mesmerized, but stretched out one of his mace-tipped tentacles and poked the clone in the shoulder. When the clone turned his head, Thresher aimed another tentacle at his victim's face. [[Pleakley]], seeing Thresher's plan, tried to warn the clone but was too late, as Thresher managed to knock him unconscious. The slug-like experiment\u00a0then used his long tentacles to pick up his\u00a0defeated opponent and place him in\u00a0one of Gantu's containment orbs.\n\nAfter capturing\u00a0Stitch and his duplicates, the five returned to Gantu's ship for a victory feast (courtesy of Reuben), but were interrupted by [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], Pleakley, and [[Dupe]]. After\u00a0Lilo tricked Gantu into using Dupe's cloning ability, Gantu used Dupe to clone Thresher into a hundred replicas. However, as Thresher's power was divided between them, they all became complete weaklings, and thus were easily defeated.\n\nPresumably after this, they were all sent to [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]] who was somehow able to re-merge\u00a0the weakling Thresher clones into the original.\n\nIn \"[[Remmy (episode)|Remmy]]\",\u00a0Thresher was one of the experiments in Lilo's dream.\n\nThresher\u00a0reappeared in \"[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]\", and was freed along with Gantu's other captive experiments by Lilo, Stitch, and several other experiments in a rescue mission.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nThe first 624 experiments, including Thresher, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium\u00a0to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]] and [[Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nThresher participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]].\u00a0During the climax, when Stitch points to the stage in the stadium, Thresher can be seen bonking a Leroy clone on the head.\n\nHowever, the Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe. Thresher joins them for the song by playing the marimba.\n\n===''[[Stitch!]]''===\nThresher made an appearance in the ''Stitch!'' anime where [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]] used him to attack [[Stitch]] during a magic show. In this episode, he looks more muscular and has bright orange eyes. He later appeared in the special ''Stitch and the Planet of Sand''.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink|Thresher}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Some sources have spelled this experiment's name as \"Thrasher,\" but \"Thresher\" is the correct spelling.\n*Thresher is the only known experiment with nine limbs: six retractable arms and three legs.\n*Thresher is one of the\u00a0ten known experiments named by someone other than Lilo, the other\u00a0nine being [[Gigi]], [[Elastico]], [[Yaarp]], [[Hammerface]], [[Heat]], [[Plasmoid]], [[Morpholomew]], [[Shrink]], and [[Leroy]].\n*Thresher, Shrink, and [[Pix]] are the only known tripedal experiments.\n*Thresher and [[Huggo]] have very similar heads/faces. Perhaps they were created using some of the same DNA.\n*Thresher, Huggo, and [[Clink]] are the only known experiments with stalked eyes, a trait common in the invertebrates that all three are inspired by.\n*Even though we saw Thresher\u00a0in\u00a0[[Experiment Pods|pod]] form, he was technically activated off-screen.\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
