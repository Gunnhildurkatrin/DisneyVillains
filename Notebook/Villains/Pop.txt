'''Experiment 009''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]]. He is designed to use his tail to blow up a balloon to the size of the room he is in, then popping the balloon, discombobulating those involved near the explosion of the balloon and causing frizzy hair.\u00a0He appears in ''[[Stitch!]]''.\n\n==Background==\nExperiment\u00a0009 was the\u00a09th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Jacques von H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel's]] funding.\u00a0He was designed\u00a0to discombobulate and disorient enemies by using his tail to blow up and pop balloons. 009\u00a0and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nPop is a small, orange and caramel-colored monkey-like experiment with two pink orbs on the top of his head with three stubby multi-colored antennae. Pop has a white face and stomach and a small red nose, as well as green markings on his rear and back. Pop's tail is a pump which he uses to blow up pink balloons which reform on his tail after they pop.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nPop can use his tail to blow up a balloon to the size of the room he is in, then popping the balloon, discombobulating those involved near the explosion of the balloon and causing frizzy hair.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Stitch!]]''===\nIn \"Stitch's Birthday: Part 2\", Pop was displayed by a young [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]] to [[Delia]] approximately around the time of [[Stitch|Experiment 626's]] creation, accidentally letting Pop out of his containment capsule. Naturally, he carried out his primary function, inflating his tail in front of an interested Delia. H\u00e4msterviel jumps on the enlarging balloon, but is propelled with the balloon. Delia soon realizes what is happening, and as she tries to escape, the balloon gets too big and immobilizes her, pressing her against H\u00e4msterviel. The balloon eventually pops, yet\u00a0Pop's fate afterwards is unknown, although he somehow ended back with [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nscreenCapture 19.02.13 22-57-49.jpg|\u8a66\u4f5c\u54c1009\u53f7 \u30dd\u30c3\u30d7 translates to \"Prototype 009 Pop\"\nscreenCapture 19.02.13 23-00-27.jpg\nscreenCapture 19.02.13 23-04-14.jpg\nscreenCapture 19.02.13 23-07-19.jpg\nscreenCapture 19.02.13 23-05-47.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
