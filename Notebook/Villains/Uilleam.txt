He is one of the [[Underland]] residents that tries to determine whether the [[Nivins McTwisp|White Rabbit]] indeed found the right [[Alice Kingsleigh|Alice]]. But in the chaos of the attack by the [[Red Queen]]'s forces, he is one of the characters captured and only appears briefly in the court of the Red Queen afterwards. It is unknown what happened to Uilleam afterwards, even after the [[Tarrant Hightopp|Mad Hatter]] tells all of the people working for the Red Queen in a plan to fight against her for her betrayal.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Uilleam is the last character to be played by [[Michael Gough (English actor)|Michael Gough]]. Gough died of pneumonia and prostrate cancer at the old age of 94 in [[2011]], a year after ''Alice in Wonderland'' was released.\n*The English Audio Description for ''Alice in Wonderland'' (included in the UK home release of the film) describes Uilleam having a plump ostrich-like body. In real life despite both of the species being flightless birds, ostriches and dodos both belong to a different group of flightless birds.\n\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nDodoalice.wonderland.2010.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Alice in Wonderland}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Birds]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]"
