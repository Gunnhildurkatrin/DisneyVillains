She is an abnormal Fluxer who can turn into a combination of animals.\n\n==Films==\n\n===Biography===\n\n===''Upside-Down Magic'' (film)===\nNory Horace was born to Augustus Horace and an unnamed mother. Her mother was a magical human who also attended Sage Academy. She died when Nory was a child.\n\n===Heading to Sage Academy===\nLike all of the other people awaiting to enter Sage Academy, Nory, her dad and Reina are standing outside the forest, waiting to be taken by Skriff. Nory admits to her dad that she's nervous, but he assures her than everything will be fine and explains that her mother was nervous at the beginning, too. After a small talk, Nory gathers up courage and follows Skriff into the creepy forest.\n\n===Placement Test===\nNory walks up to the professors a little awkwardly. She stalls and Knightslinger gives her an unpleasant look. She then Fluxes and turns into a mix of Dritten (dragon and kitten) and llama. After being given her card by Fluxer teacher Professor Han, she heads out and her and Reina gaze at their cards, excited to see what class they get to go to.\n\n===Being Trained by Skriff===\nAt first, Skriff listens to the \"Sage Way\" and only teaches Nory and her friends about math, reading, and ordinary, non-magic subjects. They also are inclined to sweep up Campus.\n\nBut Skriff realizes that he's wrong to listen, and begins to teach Nory and the UDMs how to to use their Upside-Down Magic to the fullest. They begin to train under cover.\n\n===Sneaking out to the Sage Match===\nNory decides that she'll show Sage what she's learned and bursts into the Sage Match. Skriff and the UDMs arrive just as Nory attempts Fluxing into a kitten. They cheer her on, but she grows dragon wings and soars around the room, students and professors alike watching and gasping. She is unable to Flux back, as her animal instincts have taken over.\n\nWit her enhanced powers from the Primer of Shadowe Magicks, Reina accidentally hits Nory with a fireball, which knocks her to the ground and turns her back to normal from the shock. Nory is alright, and Knightslinger warns Skriff that he has one more chance to keep his job.\n\n===Getting Attacked by Shadow Magic===\nNory wants to talk to Reina to catch up and talk about personal things. The Sparkies point her in the direction of her. But she finds Reina being controls by Chandra, a form of dark magic known as a Shadow, who only Reina could see. Chandra spoke through Reina and threatened to take her and Sage out, and Nory promised to save her and ran to tell Skriff and the others.\n\n===Stopping Chandra and Saving Sage Academy===\nWhen the Founders' Day Parade arrives, the UDMs have been prohibited by Knightslinger to attend. Reina had been chosen to represent the Flares, and instead turned into her Shadow form.\n\nThe Sage school's fight bravely against Chandra and were going to bring in special forces when Nory, Pepper, Elliott and Andres arrived, led on attack by Skriff, who ordered them quickly.\n\nThey use all of they're unique abiltes to the fullest and Nory tires down Chandra, then speaks to Reina, who fights from the inside and defeats Chandra.\n\nAfter that, the UDMs become more respected and all of the UDMs are placed in their correct classes.\n\n==Personality==\nNory is a kind, brave, loyal, intelligent, and resourceful girl. Nory puts her own worries aside to help her friends. Nory is very excitable and usually sports a grin on her face. She values her friendship with Reina, the two having been inseparable since they met: Nory tried to save Reina while Reina was under Chandra\u2018s influence, even when \u2018Shadow Reina\u2019 tried to injure Nory. Nory has a crush on Andres, albeit a subtle one. Nory is also peppy and wants to give hope to her friends.\n\nNory is very chatty and her friends usually need to tell her to be quiet, mainly Reina.\n\nNory is very stubborn, and doesn't back down easily. She always stands up for her friends, even in the most unusual situations. She is very clever and usually gets her and her friends out of danger.\n\n==Appearance==\nNory has wild, curly black hair. Her skin is dark, as her father is African-American. She is known to wear a purple T-shirt, jeans, and red sneakers. She always wears a signature headband and a patterned shirt.\n\n==Abilities==\nNory is an Upside-Down Fluxer. Instead of turning into one animal at a time, she turns into mixed-up animals: a dragon-kitten (a Dritten), or a beaver-kitten (a Bitten), or a squid-puppy (a Squippy). This causes her serious problems and gets her into plenty of trouble at Sage Academy. Despite this, Nory is an extremely strong Fluxer. She can turn into parts of advanced animals, such as elephant, flamingo, dragon, and her tutoring coach believes she will be able to turn into a tiger by early high school. She has accepted her unusual powers and who she is.\n\n==Video Games==\n\n===Magic My Way===\n''Upside-Down Magic: Magic My Way'' is a mobile continuation of the first film that allows a player to train with the UDMs. Nory is a playable character, and the player can help her complete training by fluxing into mixed-up animals at the right time.\n\n==Qualities==\n*Nory is a very bright and outgoing girl and lights up every room she steps into. She does this several time with her sweet attitude in the first movie, and many times throughout the book series.\n*Nory is very cheeky and, as confirmed by the authors, has a very skilled power for making art.\n*Nory likes to read books, as was described in the book \"''Her room was littered with this book and that, to the point where everything important was lost to the wave of endless books.''\" Which proves she is an ethic reader.\n*Along with being and excellent reader, she is also a very hard worker.\n*Nory is perhaps the most persistent female in the history of literature. When Headmistress of Sage Academy Knightslinger confirms that she could be consumed by Shadows, she is sure she can fight them and continues to be a rebel, and even inspire Scriff, the UDM teacher, to stand up against the injustice and teach the UDM's to harness their powers, not be ashamed of them. So, Nory's brightness can very much rub off on anyone.\n\n==Acquaintances/ Relationships==\nNory is very bright and bubbly, which can attract people. She has many friends and quite few real enemies.\n\n*Reina Carjaval is Nory's best friend and the secondary antagonist in ''Upside-Down Magic''. When the pressure to be a perfect Sage Student becomes to much, she is beckoned to the dark side of Magic, but ultimately saved by Nory. She is in the Flare School at Sage Academy, which means she harnesses the ability of fire.\n*Andres Padillo is the love Interest of Nory Horace and the tritagonist of the film. Their love is blunt, and slick, but It is obvious that they love one another, though young. He is ignorant about Nory when at first they meet. He is a Upside-Down Flyer and can soar up at surprising speed, but cannot come back down.\n*Pepper Paloma and Nory are close friends. She is a tritagonist alongside the other UDM's and Reina, and is very sassy and sharp-tongued. If someone is rude to her or someone close to her, she is quick to get defensive. But she can hold feelings in. Pepper has the ability to push things away instead of bring things to her, like an ordinary Flicker.\n*Elliott Cohen is a close friend of Nory's. He likes to joke and can be chill and uptight. His favorite thing to do is where multi-colored Hawaiian button-down shirts. He produces smoke and fire, being a Upside-Down Flare.\n*Skriff is the UDM teacher, and, the first UDM to actually attend Sage Academy. He was put to teach the other UDM Children due to him being able to not be of any other use. Nory encourages him to teach the other UDM's, and he comes to his senses and does. He is a Upside-Down Fuzzy, and has to sing in order to communicate with the Animal Kingdom.\n*Knighslinger is the powerful Flare Headmistress of the prestigious Sage Academy,greatest Magic School in existence. She is very strict but secretly has a side that lets her love and improve her students. She and Nory were at odds because of their separate opinions but soon came to be allies.\n*Chandra, the Main antagonist of the film Upside-Down Magic. She has the power to manipulate the Magic of Sage, posing as a powerful ally. Sensing Reina's strive to fit in, she beckons her little-by-little to incraft the forces of dark into her. She is very manipulative and can only be seen by the ones that use her book 'A Primer of Shadow Magic.' She poses a very large threat to the magical world.\n\n==Appearances==\n*Nory makes her debut when shown packing in Upside-Down Magic as she explains how she learned of her Magical Powers. They were brung out by her mother's passing of a sickness. She is shown at 7-years-old.\n* Nory makes an appearance at 13-years-old in the film, recording her last Magic Blog before she heads off to Sage Academy, which is also when Reina makes her very first appearance as well.\n* Her last appearance in the film was her in Dritten form, soaring high. She smiles at the camera, then winks, furthermore proving the end of the film before the major cliffhanger of the film.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Nory is 10/11-years in the books and 13-years in the film.\n*In the books, she attends Dunwiddle Magic School instead of Sage Academy.\n*Nory is an only child in the film.\n*She can turn into a combination of three animals at once in the film, not two like in the books. Her known film combinations are camel-dritten, peacock-elephant-kitten, dolphin-rabbit-kitten, unknown, and dritten. Her dritten (dragon-kitten) is the only known form from the books that appear in the film.\n\n===Books===\nThe ''Upside-Down Magic'' series revolves around the adventures of Nory and her friends. She appears in ''The big shrink'' and with her friends and starts the protest to get Dreggs (dragon eggs) back and to remove the Gonzalez's Ban for dreggs (dragon eggs).\n\n==Backstory==\n\n==='''Pre-Series'''===\nNory's mother died when Nory was little, leaving Nory and her siblings, Hawthorn and Dalia, in the hands of their father. Dr. Horace tried with his children, but Nory does not think he did the best job. After Nory's magic came in, Nory and her siblings hid Nory's magic from her father.\n\n===''Upside-Down Magic''===\nNory is first seen preparing for the Sage Academy Big Test. Later, when she attempts the Big Test to enter Sage Academy, Nory went seriously wonky and was denied admission to the private school.\n\nDue to Nory's unusual magic, Dr. Horace decided she would live with her aunt Margo and go to a program for magic like hers. Without telling Nory anything, he had Hawthorn pack Nory a bag and called Aunt Margo to pick her up. Nory was exiled to Aunt Margo's, forced to attend Upside-Down Magic at Dunwiddle Magic School. It did not go as badly as Nory feared.\n\n===''Hide and Seek''===\nNory's father wanted her to reapply for Sage Academy. Nory passed it, fluxing into a kitten, a puffer-fish, a puppy, a goat, and a mosquito (although it had a kitten tail), each for five seconds without going wonky. The Sage teachers thought they were very impressive.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Nory is the main focus of the ''Upside-Down Magic'' series.\n*Nory is the only known Fluxer capable of turning into dragons. She turns into a kitten mixed with a Blurper, a type of large dragon she encounters in ''Dragon Overnight'', which she has dubbed a \"dritten\".\n*\"Elinor\" is a variant of \"Eleanor\", a name given to a few historical European queens.\n*Nory's favorite cereal is Fruity Doodles.\n*She can fight them and continues to be a rebel, and even inspire Skriff, the UDM teacher, to stand up against the injustice and teach the UDM's to harness their powers, not be ashamed of them. So, Nory's brightness can very much rub off on anyone.\n*In the books, she is shown as a 7-year-old.\n*Nory makes an appearance at 13-years-old in the film, recording her last Magic Blog before she heads off to Sage Academy, which is also when Reina makes her very first appearance as well.\n*Her last appearance in the film was her in Dritten form, soaring high. She smiles at the camera, then winks, furthermore proving the end of the film before the major cliffhanger of the film.\n{{CharacterStub}}\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Upside-Down Magic characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
