A French entrepreneur and merchant, he establishes a trading post near Tarzan's jungle. He maintains a neutral relationship with [[Tarzan]].\n\n==Personality==\nHe is a savvy businessman who loves money, and acts suave and polite to others. He enjoys scamming people and is rather indifferent to the jungle inhabitants, telling Tarzan he does not wish to harm or help the animals. Despite this, he does respect Tarzan, understanding it is better to have him as an ally than an enemy, and often warns poachers that Tarzan is protective of the jungle. He promises that he wouldn\u2019t harm the gorillas, but he adds that he wouldn\u2019t help them either, mainly because they have no traits that interest him whatsoever and are not beneficial to him or his business. He also recommends Tarzan as a guide when people ask for someone to lead them through the jungle. Dumont is enamored with [[Jane]] (despite her married status) and frequently tries to charm her away from Tarzan, to no avail. This shows that he does not really seem to care or respect that she is Tarzan\u2019s wife (therefore meaning she is unavailable). \n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nPrison break4.png|Dumont, disguised as the French Magistrate with Jane as his assistant, facing [[Lieutenant Colonel Staquait]]\nRenardDumont-Mysterious Visitor.jpg|Dumont meeting [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]\n28- Queen Jane La, Hardly Seems like a Fair Fight.png|Dumont transformed into a Gibbon\nTarzan and the Volcanic Diamond Mine (45).jpg\nTarzan and the Volcanic Diamond Mine (43).jpg\nTarzan and the Volcanic Diamond Mine (29).png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Template:Tarzan}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dumont, Renard}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:French characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Tarzan characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]"
