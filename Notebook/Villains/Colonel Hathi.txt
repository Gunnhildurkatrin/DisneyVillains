An elephant never forgets.|Hathi to his mate}}\n'''Colonel Hathi''' is a supporting character from ''[[The Jungle Book]]''. He is a pompous Indian elephant that heads the [[Jungle Patrol]], protectors of the [[Jungle (Jungle Book)|jungle]].\n\n==Background==\nAt some point in the past, Hathi was a tame elephant, as he recalls fighting in the Maharajah's 5th Pachyderm Brigade. During his time with the brigade, Hathi was awarded the Victoria Cross, for bravery above and beyond the call of duty. At some point, he was released back into the wild where overtime, he built up a contempt for mankind.\n\n===Personality===\nColonel Hathi is the leader of a herd of [[wikipedia:Indian Elephant|Indian elephants]], which he runs similarly to a military squadron. Every day from dawn, Hathi has his unwilling herd march all over the jungle. However, his strict orders and constant marching sometimes cause members to consider a \"transfer to another herd\". Hathi also has a mate called [[Winifred]] and a calf called [[Hathi, Jr.]], with both appearing to be part of the army.\n\nHathi is portrayed as a pompous, buffoonish, stereotypical British soldier who is not too bright. Hathi can be petty at times, criticizing one elephant for having dust in his trunk and another for smiling too widely. He also refuses to help search for Mowgli as it would interfere with his marching. Hathi believes himself to have an excellent memory, despite his frequent forgetfulness. Later on he is destructive, crushing trees the second time he and the [[Jungle Patrol]] sing [[Colonel Hathi's March|their song]] again. However, despite his strict orders he seems quite charismatic and gets command of the Jungle Patrol.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[The Jungle Book]]''===\nHathi first appears when he and his troops are marching. [[Mowgli]], a \"man-cub\" wakes up when he feels the tree shake and hears chanting. Mowgli marches with them for a while until Hathi conducts an inspection. He is surprised when he discovers Mowgli is a man-cub due to his resentment towards humans. Bagheera calms Hathi down by assuring him that he is bringing Mowgli to the [[Man Village]].\n\nHathi reappears when his marching disturbs [[Shere Khan]]'s hunting. Bagheera goes to Hathi and asks his help in looking for Mowgli. Hathi at first refuses, but changes his mind when Winifred threatens to take over command and Junior begs him to look for Mowgli. Hathi organizes the herd into a search party which then marches into the deep jungle, knocking over every tree in their path.\n\nHathi doesn't appear again, but it's very likely at some point, Bagheera told them Mowgli was safe in the [[Man Village]] and that they could stop looking.\n\n===''[[The Jungle Book 2]]''===\n[[File:Colonel_Hathi-jbook2HD.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Colonel Hathi in The Jungle Book 2.]]\n\nHathi and his troop appear when [[Bagheera]] calls for \"Plan B\" to stop Baloo from going to the Man Village. They corner him on a log where he jumps into the water. The other elephants search for Baloo. During this, Hathi walks onto the log and it breaks under his weight. A few moments later, [[Baloo]] escapes. Later, Hathi and the other elephants are seen stampeding into a cave with Bagheera saying, \"Oh, no, not again!\" As the elephants crash, Hathi tells Bagheera that man was in the jungle. After Bagheera finds out what he's looking for, Hathi doesn't appear for the rest of the movie.\n\n===''[[Jungle Cubs]]''===\nHathi appeared as a young elephant in the spin-off series, ''[[Jungle Cubs]]'', voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]] in the first season and [[Stephen Furst]] in the second. He is shown to be friendly with the other cubs [[Baloo]], [[Bagheera]], [[Kaa]], [[Shere Khan]], and [[King Louie|Prince Louie]]. He usually attempts to keep order but is known to stammer when stressed. Early in the show, he meets his future mate, [[Winifred]], and later develops a crush on her. He also has a habit of mixing up his words throughout the show.\n\nDuring the second season, while still being friends with the rest of the cubs, Hathi begins to spend more time with Winifred and, additionally, becomes slightly bigger by stature and has lighter skin.\n\nIn ''Jungle Cubs: Born to Be Wild'' DVD, Hathi, as an adult, was in the field when [[Mowgli]], Baloo, and Bagheera were traveling to the Man Village.\n\n===Other appearances===\nIn ''[[Fantasia 2000]]'', an elephant that is believed to be Colonel Hathi makes a cameo along with another elephant that is believed to be [[Winifred]] during the \"[[Pomp and Circumstance]]\" segment of the film.\n\nIn ''[[House of Mouse]]'', Hathi was seen during the [[Rockin' at the House of Mouse|opening theme]] of the show when [[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]] run by [[Daisy Duck|Daisy]]'s clerk desk.\n\n==Video games==\n===''[[The Jungle Book Groove Party]]''===\nHathi appears playing a similar role as he did in the film. Here, Junior wishes to have Mowgli join the Jungle Patrol ranks. To test, Hathi challenges Mowgli to a dance-off.\n\n===''[[Kinect Disneyland Adventures]]''===\nIn ''Kinect Disneyland Adventures'', Colonel Hathi is briefly mentioned by Mowgli but not seen.<ref>'''Mowgli:''' \"There's a parade? I gotta tell Colonel Hathi.\"</ref>\n\n==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==\n[[File:Colonel Hathi .jpg|thumb]]\nSurprisingly, Colonel Hathi did make appearances in the parks in the past. He was a meetable character and was seen in some parades. Hathi has since retired and only comes out on special occasions.\n\n===[[Walt Disney World]]===\nIn the former [[Animal Kingdom]] show, [[Journey into the Jungle Book]], Hathi and his troops appeared playing the exact role as the film.\n\nColonel Hathi also has a spell card known as \"Colonel Hathi's Righteous Stomp\" in the attraction [[Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom]].\n\n===[[Disneyland Paris]]===\nHathi's namesake is used for [[Colonel Hathi's Pizza Outpost]] at [[Disneyland Paris]].\n\nIn [[Disney's Once Upon a Dream Parade]], Hathi was seen walking in front of the ''The Jungle Book''/''[[The Lion King]]'' float.\n\n==Differences from the source material==\n*In the original novel by Rudyard Kipling, Hathi was actually an old elephant and the de facto ruler of the jungle. He hated humans as a result of him being severely injured by a spike trap he fell into when he was young, although he did tolerate Mowgli to an extent. When the villagers cast Mowgli out, believing him to be an evil sorcerer, and planned to execute Messua for caring for him, Mowgli convinced Hathi to help him destroy the village in order to save Messua. While in the Disney version, Hathi was depicted more comically but nevertheless shared his book counterpart's prejudice towards humans and was outraged by Mowgli's presence there.\n*In the book, Hathi had three sons. In the Disney version, he had only one.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink|Colonel Hathi/Gallery}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Hathi's animation was used as a reference for animator [[Sergio Pablos]] when he animated [[Tantor]] in ''[[Tarzan (film)|Tarzan]]''.\n*Hathi's name actually means \"elephant\" in Hindi.\n*Although Hathi is supposed to be an Asian elephant, the book ''Disney Animals: The Essential Guide'' for some reason incorrectly claimed that Hathi was from [[Africa]].\n*Hathi's design was actually reused from that of [[Goliath I]]'s from ''[[Goliath II]]''.\n*Hathi is the only character to break the fourth wall in the first ''Jungle Book'' film. He speaks directly to the audience when he mentions discipline, though it can be argued he may be speaking to his army (or to himself).\n*Hathi is one of three ''Jungle Book'' characters to speak with an American accent as a child and an English accent as an adult. The other two being Bagheera and Shere Khan.\n*Hathi appears scared when Winifred threatens him to take the lead of the herd herself: this is due to the fact that real life elephants have a matriarcal society, which makes Winifred's claim a legitimate one.\n*Hathi is the only animal character that doesn't appear in the [[Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book|1994 remake]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{The Jungle Book}}\n{{Disney Crossy Road}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hathi}}\n[[ar:\u0627\u0644\u0632\u0639\u064a\u0645 \u062d\u0627\u062b\u064a]]\n[[es:El Coronel Hathi]]\n[[fr:Colonel Hathi]]\n[[it:Colonello Hathi]]\n[[nl:Kolonel Hathi]]\n[[pt-br:Coronel Hathi]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Elephants]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Jungle Book characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Spell Cards characters]]\n[[Category:Military characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Disney Universe Suits]]\n[[Category:Soldiers]]\n[[Category:Colonels]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Crossy Road characters]]\n[[Category:Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom Characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Indian characters]]\n[[Category:Fantasia characters]]"
