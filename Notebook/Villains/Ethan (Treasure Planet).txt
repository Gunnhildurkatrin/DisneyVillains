"[[File:Ethan.png|thumb]]'''Ethan''' was a deleted character in ''[[Treasure Planet]]''. He was voiced by [[Jeremy Suarez]].\n\nIn his deleted scene he was admiring Jim's solar surfer, he had a scooter but it was busted. Jim had a look at it and was about to fix it when his father (also a dropped character) fixed it for him.\n\n==Behind The Scenes==\n* Several seconds of his scene was animated and colorized.\n*[[Ron Clements]] and [[John Musker]] state his scene was to demonstrate that while Jim has a rebellious side with adults, he has a softer side around children.\n*Despite his scene being removed in the final film, Ethan and his father can still be seen attending the [[Benbow Inn]]'s reopening ceremony during the film's finale.\n\n{{Treasure Planet}}\n[[Category:Deleted characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Treasure Planet characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
