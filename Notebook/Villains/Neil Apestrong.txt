He lives in the [[Norrisville]] Zoo in Norrisville. Apestrong is briefly shown in \"[[McFists of Fury]]\", and has an important role in \"[[Rise of the Planet of the Robo-Apes]]\". In \"[[Space Cow-Bros]]\", he has an important role.\n\n==Relationships==\n===[[Randy Cunningham]]===\nRandy and Apestrong seem to be on good terms. It was shown twice that Neil helped Randy (as the Ninja both times) to defeat a huge invasion or save a innocent person.\n\n==Trivia==\n*He is named after the famous astronaut Neil Armstrong, who actually did go to the moon.\n*He can communicate with other apes, like how he talks to the Robo-Apes in \"Rise of the Planet of the Robo-Apes\".\n*He has a float in the McFistival Parade in \"[[Bring Me the Head of Ranginald Bagel!]]\".\n*He is married and lives outside of Norrisville.\n*Apparently, he is the only animal of the show who is in the good side.\n\n{{RC Wiki}}\n\n{{Randy Cunningham}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cunningham, Randy}}\n[[Category:Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja characters]]\n[[Category:Apes]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Monkeys]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]"
