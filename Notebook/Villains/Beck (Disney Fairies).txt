She weighed down the sack with gravel and tempted beck with it, and said \"there's enough Pixie Dust to take you to the other side of the world and back\".\n\nBeck agreed to use it, so she took the sack and went on the journey. She soon realized that Vidia made the sack heaver by putting in gravel in it, and even though she told her that their was enough Pixie Dust to take her to the other side of the world and back, there was only enough to take her far away from Pixie Hollow, but none to take her back. When Beck realized that Vidia wanted her gone for good so she could steal more feathers from Mother Dove, she hurried to Pixie Hollow to catch Vidia, the feather thief.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n{{Disney Fairies}}\n[[Category:Fairies]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Disney Fairies characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]"
