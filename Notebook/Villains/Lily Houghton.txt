Her coat appears with that of Frank's in the office of [[Alberta Falls]] while her map is framed in the halls of the [[Jungle Navigation Company]]'s boathouse.  This map also appears in an office within the queue for the Walt Disney World version of the Jungle Cruise.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Lily is likely partially inspired by Katherine Hepburn's character Rose Sayer from ''The African Queen'' (1951) which inspired both the Jungle Cruise attraction and film.  Her sun-hat might be a visual reference to Sayer and her father Charles Houghton is likely a tribute to the film character of Charlie Allnut.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nFile:DSA Lily Houghton.png|In [[Disney Sorcerer's Arena]]\nFile:Jungle Cruise ReAction Figure - Lily Houghton.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n== External links ==\n* ''[https://junglecruise.fandom.com/wiki/Lily_Houghton Lily Houghton]'' on the ''[https://junglecruise.fandom.com/wiki/Jungle_Cruise_Wiki Jungle Cruise Wiki]''.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Jungle Cruise}}\n{{Disney Emoji Blitz}}\n[[Category:Jungle Cruise characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:Deuteragonists]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Professors]]\n[[Category:Disney Sorcerer's Arena Characters]]"
