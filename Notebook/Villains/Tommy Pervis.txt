He is a\u00a0friend of\u00a0[[Nick Szalinski]].\n\nHe was given permission to mow the Szalinskis' backyard one Saturday (if he throws in a box of cookies), but he doesn't because he has to meet someone named Newt right away. He doesn't show up until the next morning when (unknown to him) Nick,\u00a0[[Amy Szalinski|Amy]], and the\u00a0[[Ron Thompson|Thompson]]\u00a0[[Russ Thompson, Jr.|kids]]\u00a0are shrunken in the backyard. Because of them being so,\u00a0[[Wayne Szalinski|Wayne]]\u00a0and\u00a0[[Diane Szalinski]]\u00a0tell him to stop the lawnmower and get off the grass. When he tells him Nick said he could mow it the day before, he apologizes for being late. Diane forgives him and sends him home through their house because it is \"safer\". He does not get what is \"safer\" about going through the house and he decides they are weirder than his own parents.\n\n{{Honey, I Shrunk the Kids}}\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Honey, I Shrunk the Kids characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
