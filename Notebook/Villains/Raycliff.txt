Like Folsom, Raycliff is also more of a background character, although as part of the main cast, they sometimes play major roles as well. Raycliff is known for being reticent more often than not. But when he isn't, he's quick-witted when it comes to assisting Folsom with facts, figures and infectious metaphors pertaining to the school most of the time. In the episode <ref>\"[[Two Wheels, Full Throttle, No Breaks]]\"</ref>, it is revealed he gets seasick.\n\n==Skills==\nRaycliff is adept and sharp-witted when it comes to repartee, as he thinks on his feet.\n\n==Case File==\n*Name: Raycliff\n*Occupation: Vice Principal of X Middle School\n*Associates: Dawn S.
