While many viewers assume it was an Ornitholestes, the scripts confirm that it's a ''Troodon''. Also in the film, ''Troodon'' is depicted as having a domed head and horns, since at that time it was assumed to be a Pachycephalosaur.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Troodon was most closely related to dromaeosaurs like [[Velociraptor]] and is a member of the Troodontidae.\n*Troodon had the largest brain proportionate to body size of any dinosaur.\n*Like [[Velociraptor]], Troodon had killing claws on its feet for dispatching and restraining prey.\n*In real life, Troodon was covered in feathers.\n*In a [[2017]] review of Troodontidae, it was revealed that ''Troodon formosus'' was the type species. Whether or not it's based on a tooth is dubious. Most specimens have been transferred to other genera.\n\n{{Fantasia}}\n[[Category:Fantasia characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Dinosaurs]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric animals]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric characters]]"
