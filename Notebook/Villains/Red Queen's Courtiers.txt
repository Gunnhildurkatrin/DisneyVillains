They are a group of people who attend the [[Red Queen]]'s court until [[Tarrant Hightopp]] frees them from their unfair treatment, due to the Red Queen's betrayal to them.\n\n==Background==\nThe courtiers consist of a group of people who are shown to have large body parts, although fake as revealed throughout the film, much to the Red Queen's fury. During their time, the courtiers serve their tyrannical ruler [[Red Queen|Iracebeth]] until [[Tarrant Hightopp]] escaped from execution thanks to [[Chessur]] who saved him from the Executioner. When Tarrant tells the courtiers and everyone working for the Red Queen that they have been betrayed and treated unfairly, they all reform and celebrate their freedom in rejoice as they no longer work for the Red Queen.\n\n==Role in the film==\nThe courtiers are first seen inside the [[Red Queen]]'s castle watching their ruler ask a couple of [[Frog Servants]] to know if they ate any of her tarts to which many of them deny to which she notices one single Frog who has Squimberry juice as she sends her guards to seize him. They are later seen during in the crowd during a game of croquet where [[Uilleam]] hands the Red Queen a flamingo and then uses him as a croquet to hit the hedgehog used as a ball during the game when [[Alice Kingsleigh|Alice]] reaches the Red Queen's castle to rescue [[Tarrant Hightopp|the Hatter]] to which the courtiers notice Alice's ginormous size after eating [[Upelkuchen]] to which the Red Queen tells her courtiers to give Alice some clothes.\n\nLater when Tarrant is giving the Red Queen a perfect hat to fit her, the courtiers then comment on each hat Tarrant gives to her to which the long fake nose of the female courtier next to the Queen drops much to the other courtiers' shock followed by the courtier who saw Alice and [[Knave of Hearts|Stayne]] in the corridor who tells the Red Queen to summon Stayne to look for Alice.\n\nThe next day, a group of courtiers are seen witnessing the execution of Tarrant just as the Executioner prepares to kill Tarrant to which the execution is stalled and disrupted, thanks to [[Chessur]] who saved him, much to the Executioner feeling confused, explaining that he wasn't the one who made Tarrant disappear. The female courtier who told the Red Queen about Alice last night notices that she has a fake ear, to which the following courtiers are shown to have fake body parts just as the Hatter stands in front of the courtyard to give out a message regarding the Red Queen's betrayal. The Hatter then tells everyone that the Red Queen has betrayed all of them because of her tyranny and he devises a plan to stand up against the Red Queen. The courtiers then accept his offer as they all celebrate their freedom, along with the Monkey Servants, the Frog Servants, and everyone else who is betrayed, much to the Red Queen's fury as she sends [[the Jub Jub Bird]] to go after them. As the Jub Jub Bird is released, it starts terrorizing the courtiers and former allies of the Red Queen, much to her revenge. They are not seen again after that.\n\nWhat happened to the courtiers during the events of ''[[Alice Through the Looking Glass]]'' is unknown as they are not seen in the present Underland timeline due to the Red Queen living in a new lair where her castle workers consist of vegetation-fused people.\n\n{{Alice in Wonderland}}\n\n[[Category:Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
