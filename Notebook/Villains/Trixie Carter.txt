Her best friends are [[Jake Long]] and [[Arthur Spudinski|Spud]]. She is Jake's best bud and the only female friend. She is ''fully'' [[New York City]]. Carter currently attends [[Millard Fillmore Middle School]]. Trixie loves helping Jake protect the magical community.\n\n===Personality===\nShe is sassy, vivacious, feisty, and somewhat of a tomboyish character. Although initially annoyed at Jake for how long he kept his secret from her, she loves helping to protect the magical community. She is supportive of both Jake and Spud, but for a while, she has shown a dislike and distrust toward Rose and was a bit unsupportive of Jake's feelings for her,<ref>[[Being Human]]</ref> but soon started to accept their relationship. She even comforted Jake when the two of them broke up during the school's Valentine's Day field trip event.<ref name=\"love\">[[The Love Cruise]]</ref> After Rose nearly sacrificed herself to save Jake and every magical creature in the world,<ref name=\"home\">[[Homecoming]]</ref> she tried to help Jake to move on.\n\nShe is also a trustworthy friend because even though Jake's grandfather did not initially trust her and Spud, they kept Jake's dragon secret.<ref>[[Professor Rotwood's Thesis]]</ref>\n\nShe can be very rude and inconsiderate because she threw away her long time friendship with Spud and Jake just to be with the \"cool\" girls and have girl talk with the cheer squad. But in the end, she saves both of her friends and proves to be considered loyal.<ref name=\"on\">[[Bring It On]]</ref>\n\n===Talents, Interests, and Abilities===\nTrixie has a great talent in cheerleading and acrobatics, although her fiasco with the Millard Fillmore Middle School cheer squad has turned her off from using them.<ref name=\"on\">[[Bring It On]]</ref> She enjoys {{WikipediaLink|skateboarding}} and hanging out with her friends. She also has a big interest in money, as well as great interest in biology, and aspires to become \"Doctor Trixie Carter\".<ref name=\"dream\">[[Dreamscape]]</ref><ref>[[A Ghost Story]]</ref> She is also able to hold her bladder for a long time as seen in a camping episode where she holds it a whole weekend.<ref>[[Camp Mugwomp]]</ref>\n\n==Relationships==\n===Family===\nTrixie lives at home with her mother and grandmother, although her mother is sometimes away for long periods as she is either an airplane attendant or an airline pilot. At these times, her grandmother acts as Trixie's primary caregiver, always asking her if she or her friends want something to eat. It has never been confirmed, but Trixie's grandmother may live with her.\n\nIt is established in that her father works for the military and is a fighter pilot.<ref>[[Hairy Christmas]]</ref> Trixie's family appears to be wealthy. It is shown that her mother often buys Trixie designer clothing when she is in other countries, but Trixie rarely wears them as they are not her style.<ref name=\"on\">[[Bring it On (American Dragon: Jake Long)]]</ref>\n\n===Love Interests===\nEarly on, she maintained a celebrity crush on [[Denzel Washington]], often calling out his name and asking him to \"wait for me\".\n\n[[File:Homecoming (21).jpg|thumb|250px]]\nLater she developed a more realistically obtainable obsession with another student in her school named [[Kyle Wilkins]].<ref name=\"love\">[[The Love Cruise]]</ref> She constantly boasts about her crush and will let everyone know about it.\n\nShe also once accidentally flirts and date with this one boy at a video game convention who she doesn't know and who is wearing a costume so she doesn't know who he is, thinking he was someone her age. She totally freaked out when she found out the truth about him. He turns up to be around 8 years, his height was boosted up by the help of his bulky costume, and the little brother of Kyle Wilkins.<ref>[[Haley Gone Wild]]</ref>\n\nHowever, some fans speculate that she has a crush on Spud. Going with the clich\u00e9 of friends who started dating, there was constant hinting that she might actually have romantic feelings for Spud, but she and Spud say flat out that they are \"friends and nothing more.\"<ref name=\"home\">[[Homecoming]]</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the Season One intro, Trixie plays the electric guitar in Jake's imaginary band.\n*Her hairstyle is very similar to that of [[Holly]] from ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'', also an African-American girl.\n*She uses the word \"baby\" a lot.\n*Trixie bears a close resemblance to, and shares last name with, Cleo Carter from ''Tutenstein'', which is believed to also be set in (or around) New York.\n*Trixie pukes whenever she's on boats or ships.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{American Dragon: Jake Long}}\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Carter, Trixie}}\n[[Category:American Dragon: Jake Long characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Cheerleaders]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Chefs]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
