He is the third and youngest member of Jonas who is also the most serious of the brothers and is responsible for writing the band's songs. Nick suffers from Type 1 Diabetes much like Nick Jonas does in real life.\n\n==Role in the [[Jonas L.A.|series]]==\nHe is known as the serious one, and rarely smiles, as when talking to a girl he's crushing on, Stella, Macy, and his brothers were surprised to see him smiling. It is also revealed in episode six that he is just \"three points shy of a genius\". He takes himself and his work very seriously, as when he failed an exam in\u00a0Exam Jam, he was very hard on himself that he could be the reason the band couldn't go on tour. He is the youngest and most mature of all three brothers. He also has a very intense personality, which is what makes him such a skilled musical artist, but his intensity also causes him emotional pain at times.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Penny===\nNick wrote a song for Penny, but she thought he wrote it for her to sing. When he realizes she has a boyfriend, he leaves her gig early, deeply hurt. However, he still lets her record the song with him, and is pleased when he finds out that she is now single, having broken up with her boyfriend (\"'''[[Wrong Song]]'''.\")\n===Maria===\nHe had a short lived crush on Maria, the pizza girl along with Kevin and Joe. Nick tried to impress her by singing her a song they wrote for her. She was freaked out by them all fighting over her, and eventually they realised they didn't know anything about her to be fighting over her (\"'''Slice of Life'''.\")\n===Macy Misa===\nIn the first season, Nick and Macy spend very little time together and Nick is rather put off by Macy's fan obsession with him and his brothers. Throughout the season, Macy slowly becomes friends Nick and his brothers and there were a few moments where the two looked at each other. Also, in\u00a0Love Sick, Nick calls her a genius.\n\nIn the second season, Nick and Macy's relationship begins to change when they begin to develop romantic feelings and later become a couple. Beginning in\u00a0House Party, Nick hugs her when he sees her, and says that it's good to see her. In\u00a0Back to the Beach, Nick gets jealous when a surfer suggests he'd like to spend more time with Macy, and tries to stop this from happening by saying she isn't interested. In\u00a0And... Action!\u00a0while Nick teaches Macy how to play guitar they both hint that they would like to be more than friends with each other. In\u00a0The Secret, Nick and Macy try to keep their new relationship from the others. Also in this episode, Nick writes and performs a song for Macy entitled \"Your Biggest Fan\". Nick and Macy celebrated their \"One Month-a-Versary\" in\u00a0Up In The Air. The sub plot of this episode is Nick and Kevin attempting to find the perfect gift for Macy. An on-screen kiss was filmed for the The Secret, but due to Disney's \"one kiss per season\" policy, it was dropped from the episode in favor of Joe and Stella's in\u00a0Band of Brothers. Direct and executive producer, Paul Hoen, tweeted a picture confirming that kiss actually happened.
