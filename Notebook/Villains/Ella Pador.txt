She is first introduced as one of the popular mean girls, but once Mitchie meets her, she quickly becomes friends with her. Ella is often treated disrespectfully by [[Tess Tyler|Tess]], as Ella is not the most intelligent girl at the camp, but still gets along with others well.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Camp Rock]]''===\nElla is portrayed as an air-head who is friends with Tess\u00a0and sings back-up for her at all of the jams. Ella has only so much patience, however, for when Tess is rude to her even after she pushes her other friend and back-up singer [[Margaret Dupree|Peggy]] away, Ella quits the number and instead sings with [[Barron James|Barron]] and [[Sander Loya|Sander]] at Final Jam, revealing herself to be a good performer in her own right.\n\n===''[[Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam]]''===\nThe sequel continues to portray Ella as less than intelligent, but she is given a very useful talent for fashion design. She clothes all of the performers for the Final Jam and teaches a class on this subject when the original Camp Rock councilors defect to Camp Star on the promise of higher pay. Little bits of her true character shines through in the second film. When she accidentally ends up in the guitar class for her first lesson, she decides to roll with what has happened and teach the guitar students how to properly bedazzle a shirt, sew a hem, and others. She does not let others' opinions affect her easily and shows real strength of character through this.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pador, Ella}}\n[[Category:Camp Rock characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
