He plays the accordion and is rather talented at playing it. He speaks with a Hispanic accent. Personality-wise, he does not seem as over-dramatic as his fellow classmates and seems to handle things fairly well, but gets [[Stank|stanked]] anyway (most likely due to internal panicking that he does not show too much on the outside). He was once played like an accordion by [[Bash Johnson|Bash]].\n\n==Personality==\nDave plays the accordion and is rather talented at playing it. He speaks with a Hispanic accent.\n\nPersonality-wise, he doesn't seem as over-dramatic as his fellow classmates and seems to handle things fairly well, but gets stanked anyway (most likely due to internal panicking that he doesn't show too much on the outside) where he gains the appearance of a thin blue monster with accordion-like arms.\n\nHe was once played like an accordion by Bash because he resents Dave's skills. While quieter and less expressive, that doesn't mean he doesn't get along well with others, and he actually has a good amount of friends, including his Klub pals and Howard.\n\n==Appearance==\n\n==Quotes==\n*\"Yes, a four! I give Bash a wedgie!\"\n*\"If I don't, it looks like I am wearing fur underpants!\"\n*\"He resents me for my great skill on the accordion.\"\n*\"Oh boy, I'm not gonna hear the end of this!\"\n*\"So I said 'That's not a caterpillar, that's my mustache!'\"\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Thanks to [[Julian (Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja)|Julian]]'s big mouth, people know that Accordion Dave shaves his butt.\n*Dave knows how to teach animals how to play various instruments as shown in \"[[Shoob Tube]]\".\n*Dave's stanked form makes accordion sounds when his arms move.\n*Dave is a member of the Stache Society.\n*Dave may have Hispanic heritage.\n*During the Dance Beneath the Stars in [[Sorcerer in Love]], he stands next to Julian, both awkwardly glancing around.\n*When Howard told everyone to act natural as Bash came over in [[Pranks for Nothing]], Dave bobbed up and down.\n*Dave's eyes blink very slow.\n*He was sitting next to [[Theresa Fowler]] in [[The Three Mascot-teers]].\n*Dave being voiced by [[Carlos Alazraqui]] was the first time Alazraqui collaborated with [[Jhonen Vasquez]], and could potentially work with him and [[Justin Roiland]] again in the future.\n\n{{RC Wiki}}\n{{Randy Cunningham}}\n[[Category:Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
