They appeared again in the [[Tarzan II|second film]] in the franchise and in ''[[Tarzan & Jane]]''. They also appeared in the animated television series ''[[The Legend of Tarzan]]''.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nBoth Mungo and Flynt are very playful, as shown when Flynt made Mungo hit himself over and over again. However, when they were younger, they were shown to be mean and slightly cruel towards Tarzan especially, as they wanted to exclude him from their activities and complained loudly when he said he wanted to come along. Eventually, they grow to respect him.\n\n===Physical Appearance===\nMungo is an obese and medium gorilla, unlike Flynt who is short and slender. Mungo has a medium brown coat and Flynt has a gray-black one.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Tarzan (film)|Tarzan]]''===\nIn their first appearance, Flynt and Mungo appear together with Terk, going toward a waterfall where the elephants are. Before [[Terk]] arrives, they are shown playfully hitting each other.\n\nSoon after, [[Tarzan (character)|Tarzan]] arrives and Flynt and Mungo begin to complain loudly about him being there. Terk tells Tarzan he can hang out with them if he gets a hair from an elephant being sarcastic hoping it would get rid of him, but Tarzan takes her seriously and jumps into the lake. Flynt and Mungo are amused by Tarzan's antics and Flynt tells Terk that if he survives, she should bring him around more often. The gorillas go and get a closer look.\n\nShortly thereafter, they look more closely at Tarzan catching a hair from an elephant. However, Tarzan, unfortunately, makes elephants panic at seeing him, in which they stampede toward Flynt, Mungo, and Terk, fleeing. Flynt and Mungo arrive where the other gorillas were eating termites, and despair, screaming that the blame for the elephant stampede was not theirs.\n\n[[File:Flynt and mungo2.png|thumb|left|190px|Mungo, Flynt, Terk, [[Tantor]], and other gorillas singing in camp.]]\nAs years pass, they begin to be more friendly with Tarzan and soon become great friends. When Tarzan fights [[Sabor]], Flynt and Mungo are seen rooting on for Tarzan along with the other gorillas. After Tarzan kills the evil leopard, they congratulate him along with the rest of the gorillas.\n\nThey, along with Terk, [[Tantor]], and some other gorillas, begin to look for Tarzan who recently disappeared, and arrive at the human trio's campsite and proceed to trash it, playing music on various human objects They find in camp (\"[[Trashin' the Camp]]\").\n\nTarzan returns [[Jane Porter]] to camp but departs with the other animals before [[Archimedes Q. Porter|Professor Porter]] and [[Clayton]] arrive. Sometime later, Tarzan shows the humans the nesting site. Flynt and Mungo remain there, watching humans. After the humans leave, few disagreements occurred and Clayton and [[Clayton's Men|his men]] back in place and begin to capture the gorillas, including Flynt and Mungo, Tarzan arrives and manages to stop the plan of Clayton.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\ntarzan-disneyscreencaps.com-1682.jpg|\"Stop hitting yourself!\"\ntarzan-disneyscreencaps.com-1719.jpg|(Flynt: \"Terk, what is this?
