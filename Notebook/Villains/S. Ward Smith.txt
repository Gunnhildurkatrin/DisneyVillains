Ward Smith''' is the teacher of [[Norrisville High]]'s metal shop and the blind swordsmith who forges weapons for the Ninja. [[Brent]] is working as his apprentice. He is featured in the [[Disney XD]] series ''[[Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja]]''.\n\n==Background==\nS. Ward Smith is based on the elderly masters often seen in martial arts films. He takes his duties seriously, crafting weapons for the Ninjas of Norrisville despite feeling too old to carry on his teachings. Smith never seems to crack under pressure and takes no nonsense from anyone. However, he doesn't like it when the weapons he crafts are used the wrong way, such as cutting through bulldozers or toasing marshmallows over his sacred fire pit.\n\n==Trivia==\n*His name is a play on \"swordsmith\", which is fitting considering what he does best.\n*Despite being blind, he can use his other senses to provide information. For instance, he could tell Randy was the Ninja because of the scent of his [[Smoke Bombs]].\n*He is shown in the [[What the Juice?|opening theme]] speaking to [[Mr. Bannister]].\n*It is unknown if he worked with the previous Ninjas.\n*He has an odd habit of calling Randy bizarre epithets such as \"bloofus.\"\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nSwordQuest_-_092.jpg\nSwordQuest - 097.jpg\nSwordQuest - 106.jpg\nBrent 8.png\nBrent 6.png\nBrent 7.png\nBrent 5.png\nSwordQuest - 122.jpg\nSwordQuest - 142.jpg\nSwordQuest - 154.jpg\nSwordQuest - 172.jpg\nSwordQuest - 181.jpg\nSwordQuest - 334.jpg\nSwordQuest - Dontchawannit.jpg\nSwordQuest - 435.jpg\nSwordQuest - 639.jpg\nSwordQuest - 650.jpg\nSwordQuest - 660.jpg\nSwordQuest - 794.jpg\nLiving in Shooblivion - Randy 07.png\nLivinginShooblivion_-_232.jpg\nLivinginShooblivion_-_302.jpg\nLiving in Shooblivion - Randy 05.png\nLiving in Shooblivion - Randy 06.png\nLivinginShooblivion_-_425.jpg\nLivinginShooblivion - 723.jpg\nLivinginShooblivion_-_724.jpg\nLiving in Shooblivion - Howard, Ninja and S.
