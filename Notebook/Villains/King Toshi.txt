When [[Duke Esteban]] shows him his surprise and it quickly turns into a no holds barred disaster, he tells Elena's [[Francisco|maternal]] [[Luisa|grandparents]] to let Esteban carry on despite not liking it since he promised the Chancellor he could show him his surprise and his kingdom values keeping promises no matter what.
