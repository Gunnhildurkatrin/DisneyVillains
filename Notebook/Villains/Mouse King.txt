He appeared in the episode \"[[Team Tiny]]\".\n\nThe Mouse King resided inside the walls of the Bear Family house. He was rumored by [[Brian (Goldie and Bear)|Brian]] big, sneaky, and scary. He lived in a makeshift throne room full of objects he had collected over the years. Of course, the only reason he gathered things was because he longed for something to be proud of. [[Mama Bear]]'s ring was his latest addition, but after Goldie, Bear and their tiny friends had a discussion with him, the Mouse King gives the ring back, telling about how he never realized how much it meant to her.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nMouse King Megaphone.png\nMouse King sorry.png\nMouse King team tiny.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Goldie & Bear}}\n[[Category:Goldie & Bear characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Mice]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Kings]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]"
