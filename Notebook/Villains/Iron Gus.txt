Does not really matter, because there are a lot more famous characters like [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[The Duck Avenger|Phantom Duck]]. \nAnother \"small\" alter-ego is called Ciccio fork, a wrestler in the Mickey Mouse number 2711.\n\nWhen [[Eega Beeva]] recruited superheroes to find the Ultrapods before [[Emil Eagle]] and his Bad-7, there also were two civilians given new superhero identities for this mission. One of them was Gus who got the Iron Gus armor (the other was [[Gladstone]]).\n\nIn the episode in which he appears, Iron Gus fights against [[John D. Rockerduck|Roller Dollar]], besting him, because during the struggle he had fallen asleep just above the 'Ultra-pod. Roller Dollar still manages to get the Ultrapod later (read below).\n\nIron Gus' appetite was a frequent source of trouble, as when he found and ate all of [[Super Goof]]'s Super Peanuts, which caused Super Goof to be temporarily unavailable for some missions, or when [[John D. Rockerduck|Roller Dollar]] had a lawyer robot close an icecream shop, so Iron Gus got distracted \"saving\" the ice creams from being dumped while Roller Dollar retrieved an Ultrapod.\n\n==Trivia==\n*For the name \"Iron Gus\" the authors were inspired by the legendary Marvel superhero [[Iron Man]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nSuperheroesvssupervillains.jpg\nOcca127.jpg\nOcca128.jpg|Iron Gus vs. Roller Dollar\nOcca129.jpg\nSuperheroesreunite .jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Superheroes]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Alternate Forms]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Geese]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]"
