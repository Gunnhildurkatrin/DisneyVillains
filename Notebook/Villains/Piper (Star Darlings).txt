Piper has an innate ability to read others, and has psychic powers, which often intimidate others.|Official description}}\n'''Piper''' is a character, one of the twelve Star Darling students at Starling Academy and also one of the supporting characters and protagonists in Disney's ''[[Star Darlings]]''.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nA gentle, serene, and deeply pensive girl, Piper spends most of her time as though in a waking dream. Some starlings find Piper's unperturbed nature creepy, especially because of the rumors that she is a psychic who can see ghosts. However, Piper delights in seeing the world for more than what it seems and pays these opinions no mind. Her favorite pastimes are meditation and writing poetry.\n\n== Appearance ==\nPiper\u2019s theme color is seafoam green. She is a teenage girl with tan skin, turquoise eyes, lips, and long hair tied into a ponytail. Her outfit is a one-shoulder turquoise dress with a blue belt. Her accessories are her star-charmed bracelets.\n\nOn Earth, Piper\u2019s appearance changes to look like a normal human. Her hair color changes to blonde with only a streak of seafoam green. Her skin loses its sparkle and her outfit changes to look more human. The only item that remains the same are her star-charmed bracelets.\n\n==Trivia==\n* Piper is named after [[wikipedia:Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]] (\u2653), the twelfth and last of the twelve astrological signs of the zodiac, which means the fish.\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n{{Star Darlings}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Star Darlings characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]"
