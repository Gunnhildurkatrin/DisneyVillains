The mother oyster declines his offer in a feeble voice saying it's not the time to leave her oyster bed, as she knows that oysters are eaten in months with an \"R\" in them. Though the mother advises that her children stay home, the Walrus silences her long enough to trick the oysters into following him. At the Carpenter's diner, while the Carpenter prepares a \"sauce that's fit for kings\", the greedy Walrus eats all of the oysters, leaving the Carpenter to discover their empty shells when he tried to find his share of them.\n\nInterestingly, though they are eaten, six of them make their last appearance near the end in a reprise of \"The Caucus Race.\" (Four of them were behind the Carpenter and in front of the [[Card Soldiers|card soldiers]], and the other two were behind the card soldiers and in front of the hawk.) This is likely because it is all a product of Alice's own imagination welling up as she nears waking up from her dream.\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\nIn \"[[House of Genius]]\", they make a cameo walking over a sleeping [[Donald Duck]].\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the original poem, the mother oyster wasn't present. Instead, it was the eldest oyster who warned the rest not to leave.\n*The Curious Oysters are among the few Disney heroes to be defeated and killed (and ultimately eaten) by their respective villains, along with [[Chicken Little (1943 character)|Chicken Little]] and [[Ichabod Crane]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery orientation=\"none\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nOyster-baby.jpg|Oyster [[Vinylmation]]\nOyster2.jpg\nOyster1.jpg\nWalrusEatingOysters.jpg|The oysters seconds away from being eaten by the Walrus.\nTumblr n1qoual7aS1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\nOyster inkers test 640.jpg\nQuaderno3640.jpg\nGerman bluchert verlag book 1967 back 640.jpg\nGermany_dalla_-1_1953_pg_12_blog.jpg\nCheshire Cat Tsum Tsum Phone Stand.jpg\nOystertsumtsum.jpg\nOyster Tsum Tsum Medium.jpg\nTsum Tsum Game Characters.jpeg\nLittle Oyster Tsum Tsum Game.png|''[[Disney Tsum Tsum (game)|Disney Tsum Tsum]]''\nTsum Tsum Pencil Case 1.jpg\nTsum Tsum Charm Baby Oyster.jpg\nTsum Tsum Poster.jpg\nBaby Oyster Tsum Tsum Magnet.jpg\nTsum Tsum 3DS Cover.jpg\nalice-oyster.png|Curious Oysters Stock Art\n</gallery>\n\n{{Alice in Wonderland}}\n{{House of Mouse}}\n{{DisneyTsumTsum}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Alice in Wonderland characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Marine Animals]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
