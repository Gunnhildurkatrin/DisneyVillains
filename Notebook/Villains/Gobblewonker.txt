In the episode, \"[[The Legend of the Gobblewonker]]\", [[Dipper Pines|Dipper]] and [[Mabel Pines|Mabel]] embark on a mission to get proof of the legendary sea monster that lives at the bottom of the local lake, to win a photo contest.\n==Background==\n===Physical appearance===\n[[File:S1e2_gobblewonker_character_sheet.jpg|thumb|250px|Gobblewonker's character sheet.]]\nThe Gobblewonker, as described by Old Man McGucket, has a long neck like a giraffe, and wrinkly skin like Grunkle Stan. The real Gobblewonker at the end of the episode had green, scaly skin. Its eyes are dark green and its lower jaw overlap its upper jaw. It has two tusks along with other sharp teeth, and its head has two fish hooks stuck in it, one on its nostril and one just above its eye. It has short legs with webbed feet and a tail fin. Its back had a long mane like a horse's that ran down its back. Compared to the robot, it is much less serpentine.\n==Role in the series==\nWhen [[Stan Pines|Grunkle Stan]] takes Dipper and Mabel to the lake for some \"family bonding time\", [[Old Man McGucket]] starts running around the pier saying he had seen the Gobblewonker. Dipper and Mabel try to find it with the aid of [[Soos Ramirez|Soos]]\u00a0on the\u00a0[[S.S. Cool Dude]]. Dipper accidentally finds the Gobblewonker which begins to chase them. The Gobblewonker then gets stuck in the hole of a cave.\u00a0It is later learned that the Gobblewonker is actually a robot created by [[Old Man McGucket]] who likes to create extremely dangerous robots when he feels neglected or sad. However, the real Gobblewonker is shown at the bottom of the lake at the end of the episode and swallows the camera Dipper dropped.\n\nThe robotic head is used when [[The Mystery Shack|the Mystery Shack]] is constructed into a machine to fight [[Bill Cipher]] to end [[Weirdmageddon (event)|Weirdmaggedon]].\n\n==Trivia==\n*The Gobblewonker is based off the many legendary lake monsters often reported by eye witnesses in several countries but never proven, such as the [[Wikipedia:Loch Ness Monster|Loch Ness Monster]] and the [[wikipedia:Ogopogo|Ogopogo]].\n*The sounds that the robot Gobblewonker made were the same as the Tyrannosaurus Rex from ''[[Wikipedia: Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]''.\n*The Gobblewalker, just like [[the Lake Nose Monster]] from ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'', doesn't want to be found.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\">\nFake_gobblewonker_open_mouth.png|The robot Gobblewonker.\nS1e2_gobblewonker_attack.png|Robot Gobblewonker attacking.\nS1e2_old_man_projector_screen.png|Screen of the robot Gobblewonker's construction.\nGravityfalls_real_gobblewonker.png|The real Gobblewonker.\nS1e2_dipper_pines_taking_picture.png\nreal gobblewonker mouth.png|The Gobblewonker about to swallow the camera.\ngobblewonker-GFalls.png\nS1e2_gobblewonker_misses.png\nSoos-mabel-dipper-gobblewonker.jpg\nS1e2 gobblewonker chasing.png\nS1e2 gobblewonker.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Gravity Falls}}\n[[Category:Gravity Falls characters]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Sea Monsters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Machines]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Infinity characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
