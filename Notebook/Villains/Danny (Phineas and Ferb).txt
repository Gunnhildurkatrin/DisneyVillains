He was the lead singer and lead guitarist of the 90s Fashion Metal Band [[Love Handel|Love H\u00e4ndel]]. He lives for Rock and Roll, saying that it's his life. He truly has a passion for it and is the only member of the band who stayed in the music business (owning \"Danny's Music Shop\") after the break-up.\n\n==Early life==\nDanny was born and raised in South Illinois. His parents had met and fell in love through \"boogie-woogie\" music back in the 50s, even though boogie-woogie was most popular in the 40s. As a boy, he met a poor man who sang blues and fell in love with the music from then on. He asked his father for a guitar so he could learn to play the blues, and his father agreed, and told him that without music, he would have never met his mom and Danny would never have been born. He also began to find out that many types of music is blues, just with different twists.\n\nHe began learning and mastering the guitar, learning styles of blues over the decades through styling like psychedelic in the 70s and funk in the 80s. (\"[[Dude, We're Getting the Band Back Together]]\")\n==Love H\u00e4ndel==\nIn the 90s, he founded [[Love Handel|Love H\u00e4ndel]], a 90s Fashion Metal Band with himself as lead guitarist and singer, [[Sherman (Phineas and Ferb)|Sherman]] (who went by the nickname Swampy) on Drums, and the stylish [[Bobbi Fabulous]] on Bass Guitar. Together, they became famous through the song \"[[You Snuck Your Way Right Into My Heart]]\" that was the Number 1 hit for 11 consecutive minutes. But, due to infighting at least partially caused by a dwindling fan base, the band split up. Danny ended up opening his own music shop in [[Danville]] on Main Street. (\"[[Dude, We're Getting the Band Back Together]]\")\n==Present day==\nAfter a decade, Danny was approached by ingenious [[Phineas Flynn]] and [[Ferb Fletcher]] and informed that they where trying to reform Love H\u00e4ndel for their parents' wedding anniversary that day. Danny then told them [[History of Rock|a little story]] about his history, and then said that he definitely would join, but \"good luck with the other guys\". (\"[[Dude, We're Getting the Band Back Together]]\")\n===Love H\u00e4ndel reunion===\nAt Phineas and Ferb's [[Flynn-Fletcher House|garage]], Danny is reunited with the band members and his old suit. They begin fighting (again) and then says that he's out of here. Phineas tells him to wait and asks what about the fans. Danny tells him he admires his optimism, but what fans other than [[Lawrence Fletcher|their dad]]. Then, a muted but still booming cheering can be heard through the garage door, and after Ferb opens it, they can all see miles of screaming fans.\n\nThe group then goes onto stage and sings \"You Snuck Your Way Right Into My Heart\" as Lawrence and [[Linda Flynn-Fletcher|Linda]] meet in the audience and kiss each other a happy anniversary. At the end of the song, Danny then screams out, \"Good Night Tri-State Area!\". Afterward, they sing the final song, a more fast, up-beat song called \"[[Music Makes Us Better]]\", the message Danny has been trying to spread since he first learned of music. (\"[[Dude, We're Getting the Band Back Together]]\") The fate of Love H\u00e4ndel and Danny after their reunion on June 15th was uncertain, though inferring from their appearance in episodes like \"[[Hip Hip Parade]]\" and \"[[The Klimpaloon Ultimatum]]\", it seems that he and the rest of the band now get back together to play at least for special occasions, like at the request of Phineas and Ferb. However, given that they actually had a bus with their name on it in [[Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension|''Phineas and Ferb The Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension'']], it is reasonable to assume that they have reunited long enough to go on an extended tour.\n==Songs Danny has sung==\n*[[History of Rock]]\n*[[You Snuck Your Way Right Into My Heart]]\n*[[Couldn't Kick My Way Into Her Heart]] (with [[Heinz Doofenshmirtz]])\n*[[Just Passing Through (song)]]\n*[[Tri-State Area Unification Day]]\n*[[Bouncin' Around the World]]\n*[[The Ballad of Klimpaloon]]\n*[[Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town]]\n*[[Carpe Diem]]\n*[[Robot Riot]]\n*[[The Ballads of Paul]]\n*Scrapbook of Memories (All About You)\n\n==Trivia==\n*Danny's appearance is modeled after series creator [[Dan Povenmire]]. (Phineas and Ferb wiki - User:Topher208/Dan Povenmire Correspondence)\n*Danny is the most passionate about music and deepest of the band, as he tries to make a message of how music changes life and even says that rock and roll is his life.\n*Danny was the only member of Love H\u00e4ndel who did not need to be convinced to rejoin the band for the reunion.\n*Since Danny can play the Blues, he learned to play Rock, Rock and Roll, Psychedelic music, Funk, and Metal as they are all just another form of Blues.\n*Danny can play all different types of guitars.\n*The actor who plays Danny, [[wikipedia:Jaret Reddick|Jaret Reddick]], is lead vocals for the band [[Bowling for Soup]], the band that sings the theme song for ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]''.\n*Danny can be briefly seen in the [[Mix and Mingle Machine]]. (\"[[Cheer Up Candace]]\").\n*Danny's old suit was a purple sleeveless jacket and under a pink long sleeves.

With his Love H\u00e4ndel outfit on, his hair extends well to the higher area of the back or lower.
