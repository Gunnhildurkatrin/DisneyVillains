In this, when\u00a0[[Dawn S. Folsom|Pricipal Folsom]]\u00a0is commenting to\u00a0[[Cornelius Fillmore|Fillmore]]\u00a0in the cafeteria where the sloppy Joe-eating contest is held, he's no longer there, having already left after winning once again. Instead, Linwood is in his place next to her, much to her surprise. She asks\u00a0[[Raycliff]]\u00a0who the boy is and he tells her his name. Then she asks where Fillmore went.\n\nIn\u00a0<ref>[[Field Trip of the Just]]</ref>, he's seen walking through the school's hall when he's passing by\u00a0Eric Orben,\u00a0Sanjay,\u00a0and\u00a0Dmitri. Sajnay flicks a coin on the floor when Linwood spots it and goes for it. He's then hit on the back of his neck with a spitball by Sanjay, Dmitri swats a book Linwood was carrying out of his hand, and Eric takes Linwood's picture, which is then placed in a locker with other photos of other students. Linwood is left dazed from the camera's flash.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n{{Fillmore!}}\n[[Category:Fillmore characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]"
