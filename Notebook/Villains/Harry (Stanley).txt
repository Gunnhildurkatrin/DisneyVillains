He often refers to the others as \"dude\" and sometimes acts slightly dim-witted. An example is when Harry realizes how well he gets along with Elsie, her being a cat, he surprisingly states that he thought she was a Chihuahua.\n\n==Trivia==\n*He is one of the few Disney characters to commit\u00a0malapropisms, the other two being [[Tummi Gummi]] from ''[[Adventures of the Gummi Bears|Gummi Bears]]'' and [[Toon Patrol|Smarty]] from ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nharryrun.png\nStanley - Harry and Elsie.jpg\nHarryelsie.jpg\nStanley room.jpg\nGreat Big Book of Everything.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Stanley}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Stanley Characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Playhouse Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]\n[[Category:Tritagonists]]"
