She lives at the [[North Pole]] and becomes one of [[Santa Claus|Santa]]'s reindeer after assisting the [[Super Sleuths]] in returning Santa's sack of toys. She later returns to the [[Hundred Acre Wood]] for a visit. Holly is a determined and adventurous young reindeer who yearns to prove herself. She has much fun playing many reindeer games with the other reindeer at the North Pole, but has trouble fitting in at the Hundred Acre Wood at first until her friends, [[Lumpy]], [[Roo]], and the Super Sleuths [[Winnie the Pooh]], [[Tigger]], [[Darby]], and [[Buster (Winnie the Pooh)|Buster]] help her to see the many fun things that exist in the Wood. She is voiced by Mikaila Baumel.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n{{Winnie the Pooh}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Winnie the Pooh characters]]\n[[Category:Deer]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Playhouse Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:My Friends Tigger and Pooh characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]"
