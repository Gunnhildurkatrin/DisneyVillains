She is one of the five kids that modeled as DHIs (Disney Host Interactive or Daylight Hologram Imaging) to become holographic guides to the Disney Parks. She the Disney expert of the Keepers. Their goal is to stop the [[The Overtakers|Overtakers]] from controlling the parks.\n==Biography==\nWilla likes to play by the rules. Admittedly she is a super smart geek with some pretty nerdy hobbies, like, say, archery. Actually, archery is kind of cool (and possibly useful). She\u2019s also a swimmer and an animal lover. She\u2019s pretty virtuous all around, which is why she doesn\u2019t like to break Disney\u2019s rules \u2013 sometimes problematic for a DHI trying to fight the Overtakers. But don\u2019t be fooled \u2013 Willa is a pretty daring girl and she will surprise you!\n\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nWilla Angelo.jpg|Isabella Angelo\nWilla 1.JPG|Willa on Disney After Dark\nWilla 2.JPG|Willa on Power Play\nWilla.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Kingdom Keepers}}\n[[Category:Kingdom Keepers]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Keepers characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Time travelers]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
