She is [[Jeremy Johnson|Jeremy's]] long-lost cousin and niece of [[Mrs. Johnson]].\n==Personal life==\nAnnabelle is a young businesswoman, who wants to buy the [[Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated]] building. She has either a\u00a0husband, fianc\u00e9, or boyfriend with whom she was looking for a new home. After Candace carries her to the Johnson's family meeting by her pair of boots that make the wearer extraordinarily fast, it is revealed that Annabelle is a long-lost member of Johnson family. It is implied that she dropped an anvil on her head while working, which caused amnesia. She was recognized by [[Hildegard Johnson]], because of her birthmark (a letter \"J\") (\"[[Run, Candace, Run]]\"). It is unknown if she decided to stay together with\u00a0or break up with/divorce her husband/fianc\u00e9/boyfriend after she regained her memory of being a Johnson.
