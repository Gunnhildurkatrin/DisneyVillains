He is voiced by [[J. Pat O'Malley]] in the original film and by [[Wayne Allwine]] in [[Mickey's Christmas Carol|''Mickey's Christmas Carol'']].\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Personality and Physical Appearance ===\nOtto portayed as is kind and generous. He thanks all gifts given to him (like when [[Robin Hood]] gives him money stating to god bless him). Otto is a brown seeming elderly dog. He carries a cane (because of his injury). He wears a red overall, though while he is imprisoned he wears\u00a0a large blue shirt (though his bandage still remains). He is slender with dark brown fur, and a bandage on his foot (also because of his injury).\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Robin Hood]]''===\nOtto appears to be Nottingham's blacksmith, however, at the time of the film, he has broken his leg (but nobody knows how). This has resulted in Otto falling behind in both his work and his taxes. [[Friar Tuck]] comes by one day and brings him money from [[Robin Hood (character)|Robin Hood]]. Upon hearing [[Sheriff of Nottingham|The Sheriff of Nottingham]] come by for tax collection, they attempt to hide the money in Otto's cast. Unfortunately, the Sheriff is able to hear the coins jingle as Otto walks, and manages to take the money and also with clues before he entered, the Sherrif hearing Tuck telling Otto to hide the coins, greatly startling Tuck, seeming cross.\n\nOtto's later appearances are mostly cameos. He is seen as one of the spectators at the archery tournament along with Friar Tuck and other animals. In [[Sherwood Forest]] , Otto takes part in the mocking play of Prince John, using a sock puppet to play the part of [[Sir Hiss]] and also dancing with [[Maid Marian]]\u00a0(with reused animation from ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]], [[The Aristocats]] ''among other films).\n\nLater, he is among the townspeople who have been imprisoned for not paying taxes and is seen being fed by [[Toby Turtle]]'s father as other animals watched, though he is freed by [[Little John]]. Finally, at the end of the film, he is seen at the wedding of Robin Hood and [[Maid Marian]] as there marriage carriage rides away, cheering on Robin Hood and Marian.\n\n===[[Mickey's Christmas Carol|''Mickey's Christmas Carol'']]===\nOtto makes an small appearance in the re-enacting of Charles Dicken's, [[A Christmas Carol|''A Christmas Carol'']],'' [[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'', voiced by [[Wayne Allwine]] (who also voiced [[Mickey Mouse]]).\n\nHe is first seen in the beginning of the short film, cooling himself along with other beggars by a fireplace, then asking [[Scrooge McDuck|Ebenezer Scrooge]], passing by for money (him being a beggar and rather poor), though denies him, laughing at him, glaring. He is then seen briefly at the end of the film, as Scrooge, now reformed, rushes through the streets (finally learned about kindness and Christmas).\n\n== Trivia ==\n* He is voiced by [[J. Pat O'Malley]], who also voices characters such as [[Cyril Proudbottom]], [[Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum]], and [[Colonel Hathi]] among other characters\n* He (along with [[Friar Tuck]]) say religious things like \"God bless\".\n* He made a cameo in [[Mickey's Christmas Carol]] (voiced by [[Wayne Allwine]], the voice of [[Mickey Mouse]]) when he askes [[Scrooge McDuck|Ebenezer Scrooge]] to give money to the poor.\n* Otto the dog was the last role that [[J. Pat O'Malley]] did for [[Walt Disney]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\">\nrooster ran off.jpg|Otto is taking [[Alan-A-Dale]]'s place right beside[[ Friar Tuck]].\nrobin-hood-disneyscreencaps.com-6009.jpg|Otto is about to dance with [[Maid Marian]].\nRobin-hood-disneyscreencaps com-1828.jpg|Otto shows his broken leg to the sheriff.\nRobin-hood-disneyscreencaps com-1776.jpg|\"God bless Robin Hood,\" says Otto after Friar Tuck gives him money.\nRobin-hood-disneyscreencaps com-1763.jpg|Otto greets Friar Tuck.\nRobin-hood-disneyscreencaps com-1883.jpg|Otto being robbed by the Sheriff.\nRobin-hood-disneyscreencaps com-1859.jpg|Otto walks to the rocking chair to rest while hiding his money inside his cast.\nRobin-hood-disneyscreencaps com-8303.jpg|Friar Tuck helping Otto escape jail.\nRobin-hood-disneyscreencaps com-6635.jpg|Otto being fed by Toby's father.\nCapturer.jpg|Otto who asked Ebenezer Scrooge for a penny for the poor.\nmickey-christmascarol-disneyscreencaps.com-2601.jpg\n6750D80D-504D-4800-AD01-1DAFFD8600DC.webp|Otto's cameo in ''[[The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse]] with [[Sir Hiss]], [[Skippy]], [[Lady Kluck]], [[Mother Rabbit]] and one of the [[Rhino Guards]]\n</gallery>{{Robin Hood}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Robin Hood characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:English characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey's Christmas Carol characters]]\n[[Category:Dancers]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse (TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]"
