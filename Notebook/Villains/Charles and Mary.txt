The two are a newlywed couple who go to Kauai to celebrate their honeymoon, but often face trouble with some of [[Stitch]]'s [[Experiments|cousins]], such as in the episodes \"[[Cannonball (episode)|Cannonball]]\", \"[[Kixx (episode)|Kixx]]\", \"[[Yaarp (episode)|Yaarp]]\", \"[[Babyfier (episode)|Babyfier]]\", \"[[Drowsy (episode)|Drowsy]]\", \"[[Slick (episode)|Slick]]\", \"[[Retro (episode)|Retro]]\", \"[[Spats (episode)|Spats]]\", and \"[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]\".\n\n==Personality ==\nLittle is known about their personalities since they appear sporadically throughout the series as comic relief, mainly due to encountering a few of Stitch's cousins\u00a0who annoy or torture\u00a0them in some manner. They love each other and enjoy having fun.\n\nCharles is slightly arrogant about his job, often telling people he is a vice president. Mary's personality seems to be rather romantic, often telling people they are on a honeymoon and trying to take in the sights. Charles seems out of shape, as he was unable to keep up with Mary on a nature hike. He also enjoys taking pictures.\n\n==Role in the series==\nThey first appeared briefly in \"[[Cannonball (episode)|Cannonball]]\", where they were seen relaxing on [[Lahui Beach|the beach]] until [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] trampled past them to capture [[Cannonball]].\n\nThey reappeared in \"[[Kixx (episode)|Kixx]]\", where they were seen walking along on a nature trail and Charles threw his water bottle away, causing the water from it to trickle out and touch [[Kixx]]'s pod, activating him. He later attacked the two.\n\nIn \"[[Yaarp (episode)|Yaarp]]\", they were taking pictures of Kauai and buying [[Mrs. Hasagawa's Fruit Stand|fruit]] from [[Mrs. Hasagawa]] before [[Yaarp]] blasted their eardrums with his megaphone, making them temporarily deaf. They later tried to buy a new camera at an electronics store, only for Yaarp to destroy the store. They then went to the same cave where Yaarp was hiding, while [[Pleakley]] went in to capture Yaarp. When Pleakley heard footsteps approaching, he turned on his vacuum-sucking device meant to capture Yaarp, but accidentally stole Charles and Mary's clothes as a result, though he gave them back. Later, when the cave collapsed, they ran out. They then went to a [[Museum of Natural History Kauai|museum]] for peace and quiet before Gantu showed up and started attacking, causing them to complain to the [[Mayor Anolo|mayor]].\n\nIn \"[[Babyfier (episode)|Babyfier]]\", [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] tried to get them to buy her 100% Kona coffee, but they refused before they got turned into babies by [[Babyfier]].\n\nIn \"[[Drowsy (episode)|Drowsy]]\", [[Drowsy]] put them to sleep by simply bleating.\n\nIn \"[[Slick (episode)|Slick]]\", [[Slick]] sold them a trophy which they used to keep the outdoor table they were eating on steady, but Lilo\u00a0and Stitch bought it back.\n\nIn \"[[Retro (episode)|Retro]]\", the two were enjoying themselves on the beach as they were bathing before [[Retro]] was activated. He then turned their clothes, Mary's cell phone, and their car primitive.\n\nIn \"[[Spats (episode)|Spats]]\", Lilo tried inviting them to [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] and Pleakley's [[Jumba & Pleakley's Bed & Not Breakfast|Bed and Not Breakfast]] to help make money for Lilo, but they declined, saying it was too weird for them. Later, [[Spats]] zapped them with his argument-inducing ray and caused them to get into a fight, with Mary slapping Charles for getting too fresh with her and Charles saying it was their honeymoon. Later on, they watched the match between [[Suga Mama]] and Gantu and counted to ten, ending the belligerence between them as that was the cure to Spat's argument-inducing ray.\n\nThey were last seen in \"[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]\" enjoying [[Shave Ice|snow cones]] that [[Dupe]] and [[Slushy]] made.\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*As stated by executive producer Jess Winfield on his TV Tome Q&A thread, Charles and Mary are based on fellow executive producer [[Bobs Gannaway]] and his wife.<ref>{{cite web|title=L&S Says Mahalo|url=http://lasfansite.atspace.me/stuff/history/tvtome/page03.html|website={{WikipediaLink|TV.com|TV Tome}}|via=Yet Another Lilo & Stitch Fansite|accessdate=March 18, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319134719/http://lasfansite.atspace.me/stuff/history/tvtome/page03.html|dead-url=no|archivedate=March 19, 2016|page=3|date=December 13, 2004}}</ref>\n*Both Charles and Mary experience a lot of bad luck throughout the series, mainly for the purpose of slapstick, as in almost every episode they appear in they often run afoul and get attacked by various [[experiments]] (as well as other side characters chasing these said experiments such as [[Gantu]]) every time they go on their honeymoon in Hawaii.\n*Despite them saying in \"[[Yaarp (episode)|Yaarp]]\" that they'll never come back to [[Hawaii]] due to some aliens ruining their honeymoon, they reappeared in \"[[Babyfier (episode)|Babyfier]]\", \"[[Drowsy (episode)|Drowsy]]\", \"[[Slick (episode)|Slick]]\", \"[[Retro (episode)|Retro]]\", \"[[Spats (episode)|Spats]]\", and \"[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]\".\n**It is possible they returned because they either forgot about it, gave Hawaii another chance, or said episodes chronologically took place before \"Yaarp\".\n*In \"Spats\", after being hit by [[Spats]]' argument ray, Mary slapped Charles after she accused him of getting fresh with her, only for him to reply that it's their honeymoon.\n**It is possible this episode chronologically took place before \"Yaarp\", serving as a continuity.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nVlcsnap-2013-07-23-18h06m49s96.png\nVlcsnap-2013-07-23-18h06m12s110.png\nVlcsnap-2013-07-23-18h06m58s57.png\nbabyfied charles and mary.png|Charles and Mary after getting affected by [[Babyfier]]\nVlcsnap-2013-06-08-20h05m45s29.png\nVlcsnap-2013-06-08-20h06m40s66.png\nScreenCapture_19.09.13_20-00-24.jpg\nScreenCapture 19.09.13 20-13-21.jpg\nVlcsnap-2013-03-16-13h37m52s21.png\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
