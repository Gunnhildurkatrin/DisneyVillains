He is the older brother of\u00a0[[Miley Stewart]].\n\n==Personality==\nJackson is often the comic relief of the series, making jokes, making people get hurt, and dancing silly. He's an indifferent student, more fond of video games, girls, and food than he is of schoolwork. He works at\u00a0Rico's Surf Shop\u00a0and drives a red car that he purchased for himself. His storylines often form a comedic subplot during the show.\n\nJackson is very much interested in sports, playing volleyball on the school team. According to Miley, he goes to basketball games once a week and likes the Los Angeles Dodgers. He also likes the Los Angeles Lakers, and enjoys watching the Tennesee Titans football games with his Dad. He likes taking challenges, and beat the world record for pogo-jumping by four hours. He also has been seen playing video games. In\u00a0Bye Bye Ball\u00a0he was playing on what could be the Nintendo Game Boy or Game Boy Color. Also in\u00a0We Are Family: Now Get Me Some Water!\u00a0Jackson is also skilled at plumbing.\n\nJackson is rather messy, and has made all of the Stewart family's previous housekeepers quit. However, when Lilly cleans his room, he has difficulty finding things.\n\n==Talents==\nJackson's main talent appears to be acting. He is also good at imitations, such as [[Elvis Presley]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], the Godfather, and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].\n\n==Friends==\nThough Jackson has had many friends, his closest friend is\u00a0Rico. His other friends include\u00a0Cooper,\u00a0Thor, and\u00a0Oliver. Over the course of the series, he has made temporary friendships, but none of them have lasted, at least on screen.\n\n==Relationships/Crushes==\n*'''Olivia'''\u00a0-\u00a0Cooper's sister who likes Jackson, but tells\u00a0Cooper\u00a0she doesn't.\u00a0'''Episode''':\u00a0I Can't Make You Love Hannah if You Don't\n*'''Becky'''\u00a0- A girl who is dubbed \"Brainless Becky\" (by\u00a0[http://hannahmontana.wikia.com/wiki/Thor Thor]) and \"Brainless, Bodacious Becky\" (by Jackson).\u00a0'''Episode''':\u00a0Get Down, Study-udy-udy\n*'''Julie'''\u00a0- A girl who Jackson lies to about being a motocylist, though she does not believe him.\u00a0'''Episode''': Take This Job and Love It\n*'''Jenny'''\u00a0- A girl who Jackson is taking to Hannah Montana concert, but is never seen.\u00a0'''Episode''':\u00a0I Am Hannah, Hear Me Croak\n*Hannah Montana\u00a0- Jackson was caught going to the same house with\u00a0Hannah Montana, and began going out with her.
