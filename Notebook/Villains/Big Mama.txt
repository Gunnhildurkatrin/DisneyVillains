And time has a way of changing things.|Big Mama, to Tod}}\n'''Big Mama''' is a major character in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[1981]] feature film ''[[The Fox and the Hound]]''. She is a good friend and mentor of [[Tod]].\n\n==Background==\nBig Mama is an owl who appears to live close to [[Widow Tweed|Widow Tweed's]] home. She appears to be close friends with [[Dinky and Boomer]], as well as forest inhabitants like [[Vixey]].\n\n===Personality===\nShe is a motherly character who coordinates Tod's adoption by Widow Tweed and later advises and cares for Tod while he is growing up. She possesses a great deal of wisdom and is generally friendly to everybody.\n\n==Role in [[The Fox and the Hound|the film]] ==\nBig Mama is the first to discover a newly orphaned baby fox after having witnessed [[Tod's Mother|its mother]] getting shot and killed by hunters (off-screen) and is quick to comfort the baby. Hearing a pecking noise nearby, she enlists help from [[Dinky and Boomer|a sparrow named Dinky and a woodpecker named Boomer]] to find a new caretaker for the baby. While Boomer taps on a front door to a house of [[Widow Tweed]], who answers the door, Big Mama and Boomer lead Tweed to the baby by taking a piece of her laundry that they drop on the fox, whom Tweed subsequently adopts and names [[Tod]].\n\nWhen Tod grows older, Big Mama notices the irony of his best friend being a hound dog named [[Copper]], who is supposed to be his natural enemy. After Copper is taken away on a long hunting trip, Big Mama lectures Tod about the dangers of his friendship with Copper, [[Lack of Education|warning]] that it will lead to Tod getting killed. To illustrate her point, Big Mama, along with Dinky and Boomer, show Tod countless animal skins that Copper's owner [[Amos Slade]] has hunted down. Big Mama also warns Tod that Copper will be a trained hunting dog when he returns and thus will pose a danger to Tod. Tod initially rejects Big Mama's warning, claiming that Copper would never hunt him.\n\nWhen winter comes, Big Mama says goodbye to Dinky and Boomer as both birds fly south for the season.\n\nNext spring, as Big Mama throws a pile of leaves out of her home, she sees Tod (who is now grown-up). Dinky and Boomer return home, and Big Mama greets the two birds with a hug, happy to see them again.\n\nFollowing an incident that resulted in [[Chief]] gravely injured, Big Mama, Dinky, and Boomer watch Amos try to barge into Tweed\u2019s property.\n\nAfter Tod is released into the wild, Big Mama flies to the forest, searching for him. During her search, she finds [[Vixey]], a vixen who lives in the forest. Big Mama tells Vixey about Tod and arranges for the two to meet, for Tod has no idea how to survive in the wild. After finding Tod, Big Mama sets Vixey into the sunlight to make her look as beautiful as possible, then goes over to Tod, whom she leads to the vixen. After Tod and Vixey become enamored with one another, Big Mama watches as Tod attempts to catch a trout to impress her but ends up humiliating himself, resulting in him insulting Vixey and the two foxes refusing to see or talk to each other. Big Mama intervenes by singing \u201c[[Appreciate the Lady]]\u201d to persuade Tod into giving Vixey a second chance, which successfully works as the two foxes fall in love.\n\nBig Mama is last seen sleeping in her tree when she is awakened by Boomer\u2019s pecking. Squeeks, who has transformed into a butterfly, flies over to Big Mama, then waves goodbye to the butterfly as it flies away. But then she is awakened again by Amos Slade\u2019s fuss over his injured leg while being nursed by Widow Tweed.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nbig mama00.jpg\nbig mama8.jpg\nJuly3rd.png|Big Mama in Disneystrology book\nBigMama.jpg\nBig Mama.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Fox and the Hound}}\n[[es:Mam\u00e1 B\u00faho]]\n[[fr:Big Mama]]\n[[nl:Mama Uil]]\n[[pt-br:Mam\u00e3e Coruja]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:The Fox and the Hound characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Owls]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Mentors]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:American characters]]"
