He has likely been with them since [[Annie James|Annie]] and [[Hallie Parker|Hallie]] were born. He is a sommelier, which he demonstrates by choosing a \"lovely choice of wine\" one night for dinner.\u00a0Elizabeth describes him as a\u00a0\"lovable\u00a0brother\", which speaks to his close relationship with the James family.\u00a0\nIt is revealed he likes swimming, as at the Stafford, he explains he's \"going for a dip\". He is also very close to Annie, as he accompanied her to\u00a0[[Camp Walden]], and has nicknamed her \"Old Bean\".\u00a0They even made up a secret handshake together, consisting of eighteen moves.\n\nAt the end of the film, Martin falls in love with [[Chessy]] and they get married in the monologue. \n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{The Parent Trap}}\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Servants]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:English characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Parent Trap characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]"
