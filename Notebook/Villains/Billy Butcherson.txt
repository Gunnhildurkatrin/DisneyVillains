Butcherson is Winifred's ex-boyfriend.\n\n==Role in the film==\nWhen he was first alive, Billy dated Winifred Sanderson. Unfortunately, she found out he was in love with her younger sister Sarah Sanderson. An angry Winifred poisoned him and sewed his mouth shut with a dull needle so he could not tell her secrets, even in death. He died on May 1, 1693.\n\nThree hundred years later on Halloween, Winifred resurrected him and instructed him to get her book back from Max, Dani, Allison, and Binx. They escaped through the sewers and Max knocked Billy's head off. He then ended up aiding the kids in trying to defeat the Sanderson Sisters in the cemetery; once they were defeated at sunrise, he returned to his grave. With a big yawn, he flopped back in the ditch.\n\n==Trivia==\n*During production, Billy Butcherson's actor, Doug Jones, took about 2 and a half hours for him to put on the zombie costume while preparing for the film. Additionally, after filming, Jones had to sit for 45 minutes to remove the zombie costume after finishing the scenes.\n**Additionally in an early version of ''Hocus Pocus'' during the Halloween party scene, Billy became a nice zombie while enjoying his moment at the Halloween party where he makes friends and joins a conga line.<ref>''Hocus Pocus'' Trivia and Treats Edition (Anniversary Edition; Blu-ray / Digital formats, 2018).</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nHocusPocus 1858.jpg\nBilly Butcherson Headstone.jpg|The caption engraved on Billy's tombstone\nReg 6630 8.jpg\nHocusPocus 2108.jpg\nBilly Butcherson Resurected.jpg\nHocusPocus 2153.jpg\nHocusPocus 2191.jpg\nHocusPocus 2356.jpg\nBilly Butcherson.jpg\nHocusPocus 2596.jpg\nHocusPocus 2601.jpg\nHocusPocus 3068.jpg\nHocusPocus 4208.jpg\nMax and billy.jpg|Billy uses Max's knife to cut open his mouth.\nHocusPocus 4228.jpg\nHocus-disneyscreencaps.com-9525.jpg\nHocusPocus 4354.jpg\nHocusPocus 4368.jpg\nHocusPocus 4590.jpg\nHocusPocus 4634.jpg|William yawning\nHocusPocus 4635.jpg\n329575 10150363320830807 1396905958 o.jpg\n291182 10150363328810807 1240080358 o.jpg\nHocus-pocus-30th-anniversary-look-back-14.jpg\nPicture 19.png|Behind the scenes\n14287 hocusbehind2f.jpg\nBehind-the-scenes-makeup-photos-25.jpg\n6b911d5e8b577243f0d4e04d0c0f382b.jpg\nEmojiBlitzBilly.png|Billy\u2019s emoji in [[Disney Emoji Blitz]].\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Hocus Pocus}}\n{{Disney Emoji Blitz}}\n{{Disney Heroes: Battle Mode}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Butcherson, Billy}}\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Hocus Pocus characters]]\n[[Category:Those brought back to life]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Zombies]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]"
