"[[File:Thinner_Mickey.jpg|thumb|250px]]'''Thinner Mickey''' is a deleted concept from the video game ''[[Epic Mickey]]''. This was supposed to be a form of [[Mickey Mouse]]\u00a0that he would turn into if he used too much [[Thinner]] or made bad choices\u00a0such as\u00a0destroying enemies with Thinner, thinning the environment and townsfolk or defeating bosses with Thinner. If the player did bad things, Mickey's [[Paint]] would melt off of his body, leaving only his outline and getting claws and sharp teeth.\n\nThis idea was later shelved and changed to the \"Scrapper Mickey\", before the idea was eventually removed entirely.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nScrapper-mickey.png|Scrapper Mickey in the beta version of the game.\n</gallery>\n\n{{Epic Mickey}}\n[[Category:Deleted characters]]\n[[Category:Epic Mickey characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Mice]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Alternate Forms]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]"
