It is capable of granting people three wishes by tossing \"their riches\" into the well. However, the well can easily misunderstand what the wisher wishes for.\n\n[[King Roland II|Roland]] made a poor first wish in it once, which he prefers to tell [[Princess Amber|Amber]] and [[Sofia the First (character)|Sofia]] about at another time after he uses his second wish to turn Sofia from a cat back into a human. Amber wasted her three wishes by first asking for a new tiara, making Roland allergic to Sofia, which turned Sofia into a cat, and wishing Sofia wasn't a purple cat in an attempt to break the spell, which only turned Sofia pink. After the well is locked up, [[Clover]] finds it and wishes for a lifetime supply of radishes, which causes him to be buried in an avalanche of vegetables.\n\nThe well also has a face that looks like a sun with a creepy, ventriloquist's dummy-like smile and speaks in a soft, robotic voice. It appears that the well's concept of \"riches\" depends on the potential recipient's idea of value, as it accepted Clover's offer of a carrot in return of his wish.\n\nIn \"[[Forever Royal]]\", it is revealed in a flashback that Roland's first wish in the wishing well was to have a family with his wife, and his wish was granted when his wife gave birth to Amber and [[Prince James|James]]. Unfortunately, shortly after their children were born, Roland's wife fell ill and passed away, perhaps implying that her death was the price Roland paid for his first wish.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"180\" captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\">\nWishing Well (sofia the first).jpg|The face in the well\nWhen You Wish Upon a Well 14.jpg|The gate to the Wishing Well\n</gallery>\n==Trivia==\n*The well's voice and some of the phrases it uses are evocative of HAL-3000 from ''2001: A Space Odyssey.''\n\n{{Sofia the First}}\n[[Category:Magical Objects]]\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Sofia the First characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Sofia the First objects]]"
