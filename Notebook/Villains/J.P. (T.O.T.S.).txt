He is a T.O.T.S. baby deliverer who speaks in a French accent.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nJ.P. is very egotistical and always thinks of himself as top deliverer. He loves to look at his hair every chance he gets. He looks down on Pip and Freddy as baby deliverers because they aren't storks. J.P. has shown his softer side. J.P. also believed winning was more important than anything else, until the annual Easter Egg hunt, when he gave away his win to Pip and Freddy, who cared more about Percy the Peacock than winning.\n\nIt was later shown that J.P. also prioritized flying over taking care of a baby. After discovering he had never gotten his stamp for taking care of a baby, Captain Beakman was forced to demote him to Junior Flier until he passed the test. With the help of Pip and Freddy, and admitting he didn't pass the test by himself, he figured out how to make a baby happy on his own. He then earned back his rank of Super Duper Flier.\n\nIn Season Two, J.P. becomes a \"proud papa\" by adopting a very mischievous puppy named Lucky. On T.O.T.S. picture day he wanted his son Lucky to match him perfectly, but realized later it was more important to make his son happy, than being picture perfect.\n\n===Physical Appearance===\nJ.P. is a stork with a long reddish beak. He has black hair with a bon. J.P. wears his T.O.T.S. uniform, which is a blue shirt with white buttons.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nTime to Fly with T.O.T.S..png\nDdgfucr-e84a79ca-2ffc-48f1-8585-09718871ee77.jpg\nb294cfed4fd255b45806c7d09d1b0ecd.png|JP and Prince Tiberius\n45107c3176151ca2308559617694197a.png|JP tickling Prince Tiberius\nddgkzrf-a2eaea30-ffde-4b7d-a9e8-1e214fe5b76b.jpg|JP\nJunior Flyer J.P..png|J.P. taking care of a baby\nJ.P..jpg|J.P. and Blondie\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{T.O.T.S.}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:J.P.}}{{DEFAULTSORT:J.P.}}\n\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:T.O.T.S. characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Storks]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:French characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]"
