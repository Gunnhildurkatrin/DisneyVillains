"[[File:Umperio_Bogarto.jpg|thumb|250px]]\n'''Humphrey Gokart '''is a private detective. He was invented by Carlo Chendi and [[Giorgio Cavazzano]] in the early 1980s. He is named after the actor Humphrey Bogart. Bogarto's office is straight from a typical 1920s-era [[United States|American]] detective novel. He is running severely late on payment of his rent. Bogarto wears a trench coat, a fedora and gum-soled shoes.\n\nAs a detective, Bogarto is rather clumsy and incompetent. Despite this, [[Scrooge McDuck]] often relies on his services, because he is by far the cheapest detective in [[Duckburg]]. Bogarto started his career as a hotel detective, with the job of looking for clients who left without paying. After moving on to bigger cases, Bogarto has started cooperating with [[Copete Duck|Fethry Duck]].\n\n{{Wikipedia|List of Donald Duck characters}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Detectives]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
