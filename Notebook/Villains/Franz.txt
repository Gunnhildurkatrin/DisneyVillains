He is also a friend of Dusty and [[El Chupacabra]], and hangs out with the racing competitors. He seems to change personality and voice pitch when turning into a plane.\n\n==Trivia==\n*His design appears to be based on the 1954 Taylor Aerocar.\n*Oliver Kalkofe also voiced Franz in the German version.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"180\" captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nVlcsnap-2013-05-28-16h23m36s2.png\nDisney-Planes-Trailer-2-El-Chupacabra-and-Franz.png\nPlanes12.png\nScreenshot 3 Planes.jpg\n999181 560007557389169 682167969 n.jpg\nDisney Planes- Mattel diecast- Franz.jpg|Die-cast\nFranzDisneyStore.jpg|Disney Store\nFranz Fleigenhosen Disney Store Wings Back.png|Disney Store in Driving Mode\n</gallery>\n\n{{Planes}}\n[[Category:Planes characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:German characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Aircrafts]]"
