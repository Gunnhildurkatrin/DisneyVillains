According to the Fortune Teller, the Hairfish is a cursed, monstrous fish whose curse was cast long ago by an unknown sea witch and only a school of silver fish will turn a Howling Hairfish back into a normal fish. The only Howling Hairfish that is able to speak is Flounder.\n\n==Role in the series==\nA regular Hairfish appeared where [[Sebastian]] will never be forgiven by [[Urchin]] once it ate the trophy. [[Urchin]] got mad at him that he will never forgive it. Later when the gang arrives to the Fortune Teller to find out how to break the curse, the orb she shows them features a school of silver fish turning it into normal.\n\nAnother variant of the species is a blood-red colored variant and is actually [[Flounder]] who was cursed after feeling a \"'''little hairy'''\". He started to attack the village and the villagers form an angry mob to capture him for the destruction. [[Flounder]] starts to repel himself from the great white sharks; after that, he reverted back into his normal self and the mob captured him, putting Flounder in a cage inside a sunken ship.\n\nIn the cage, Flounder turns into a Howling Hairfish again and started to rampage. [[Ariel]] used a school of silver fish to enter the sunken ship as the mob is tumbling down the ship, as the silver fish turned the Howling Hairfish back into [[Flounder]], as the villagers cheer, breaking the curse. As a result, Flounder no longer transforms back into the monster he frequently transforms into, thanks to the silver fish that helped break the curse.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nLittle Mermaid - Hairfish Flounder.JPG|Flounder as a Howling Hairfish\nHowling Hairfish's Death.jpg|Flounder (as a Howling Hairfish) being turned back to his normal self\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Little Mermaid}}<noinclude>\n[[Category:Preloaded templates]]</noinclude>\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:The Little Mermaid characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Fish]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Werecreatures]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]"
