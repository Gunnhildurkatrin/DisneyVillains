"{{Infobox character\n|image = Clyde Livingston.jpg\n|name = Clyde Livingston\n|films = ''[[Holes]]''\n|actor = Rick Fox\n|alias = \"Sweetfeet\"\n|occupation = Former Baseball Player\n|alignment = Good}}\n'''Clyde \"Sweetfeet\" Livingston''' is a fictional baseball player that appears in the [[2003]] live-action film, ''[[Holes]]''. Sweetfeet plays for the Texas Rangers. He donated his pair of sneakers that he wore in the World Series to a\u00a0homeless shelter to be auctioned off. During the trial in which [[Stanley Yelnats IV|Stanley]] is falsely arrested and tried for stealing the sneakers that Clyde had donated to the homeless shelter, Clyde reveals that, as a kid, he was an orphan, so he can relate to the children on how it feels to grow up not knowing who your biological parents are.\n\nEventually, Stanley is proven innocent and his dad finally finds the solution to an odor-eliminating mixture that he has been trying all his life to create and perfect---the unlikely combination of peaches and onions. His new foot odor product, \"Sploosh\", was later endorsed in a commercial\u00a0by Sweetfeet.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery captionalign=\"left\" spacing=\"small\">\nSweetfeet's Poster.jpg|Poster\nSweetfeet's Shoes.jpg|Sweetfeet's Shoes\nClyde Livingston Signature.jpg|Signature\nTumblr nk3lnyWMSs1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\n</gallery>\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Holes}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Livingston, Clyde}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Holes characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Orphans]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]"
