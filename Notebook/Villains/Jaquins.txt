They are a cross between a jaguar and a macaw and are known as the guardians of [[Avalor]] sworn to protect the kingdom from dark forces that would threaten it. Due to [[Shuriki]]'s invasion, they were reluctant to trust foreigners such as [[Sofia the First (character)|Sofia]] until [[Elena Flores|Elena]] was restored to power.\n\n==Background==\n===Behavior===\nJaquins are very friendly toward humans and can speak English dialogue. Jaquins make their homes in high mountains, and much like birds, they sleep in nests and hatch from eggs. They also have an omnivorous diet and are shown eating various food items like meat and even fruits like mangoes. They are very fond of music. Baby Jaquins are fast learners soon after hatching, and can get very cranky when they get hungry, specifically for Anoki Berries. It normally takes baby Jaquins days to hatch from their eggs, but it is known they can come a lot sooner than expected.\n\nJaquins have acted as guardians for Avalor for centuries by driving out mythical and dangerous creatures out of Avalor. Many Jaquins are greatly ashamed they were not able to defeat Shuriki or drive her out when she first came to power. Keeping with tradition, each year the Jaquins hold a lottery to pick a Navigara, to train three young Jaquins in becoming guardians of Avalor. It is a big responsibility that is taken seriously by the clan.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nThe Jaquins are a cross between a jaguar and a macaw. Aside from their wings, they have feathers on the back of their legs and on the end of their tails.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Their species, a Jaquin, is a cross between a jaguar and a macaw, which are both indigenous animals to Latin America.\n*As the guardians of Avalor, the Jaquins are symbolized on the kingdom's flag.\n*It was shown in ''[[Elena and the Secret of Avalor]]'' that Jaquins are omnivorous. This may be a blend of the real diets of the two species they are based on, the jaguar which is a carnivore and the macaw which is an herbivore.\n*King Verago says that he has been ruling as king for over 50 years meaning that similar to a macaw they have long life spans.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nElena and the Secret of Avalor - The Spirit of Avalor.jpg\nJaquins together.png\nThe trio with other jaquins.png\nJaquins over a family.png\nOther Jaquins.png\nJaquins at the palace.png\nHeroes on jaquins.png\nElena and the Secret of Avalor to the castle.jpg\nA Brown Jaquin.png\nA Pink Jaquin.png\nAvalor Jaquins.png\nBrown and red Jaquin.png\nGreen and Blue Jaquin.png\nVallestrella Escort Jaquin.png\nThree Jaquins and a Princess 03.jpg|Jaquin cubs\nElena of Avalor Realm of the Jaquins.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Elena of Avalor}}\n{{Sofia the First}}\n[[Category:Elena of Avalor characters]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Mystical animals]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Jaguars]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Sofia the First characters]]\n[[Category:Hybrids]]\n[[Category:Parrots]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
