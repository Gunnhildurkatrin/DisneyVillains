He is harsh and shows no affection for his dog, but White Fang still displays loyalty toward him out of respect for his superiority.\n\n== Role in the film ==\nWhen a group of native Alaskans discover the cub, their chief, Grey Beaver, notes his \u201cwhite fang,\u201d proving the animal is descended from a domesticated dog. Grey Beaver adopts the cub and names him \u201cWhite Fang.\u201d Jack and Alex travel downstream to Grey Beaver\u2019s village, and spend the night there at the chief\u2019s invitation. Jack is intrigued by White Fang and tries to befriend the dog, but Grey Beaver discourages him, explaining that dogs are for work, not friendship. In the morning, Jack wanders away from the village and is pursued by a bear. He takes cover under a woodpile while White Fang comes to his defense and chases the bear away. Jack rewards the dog with a piece of jerky before he and Alex leave. After they arrive at Scott Conroy\u2019s abandoned cabin, Alex offers to work the mine if Jack teaches him how to read. Meanwhile, Grey Beaver and White Fang arrive in Klondike City, where they encounter Beauty Smith and his fighting dog, Buck. While Grey Beaver offers animal pelts to a storekeeper, Beauty instigates a fight between the two dogs and White Fang wins. When Grey Beaver emerges from the store, Beauty demands compensation for his injured dog, forcing the chief to surrender White Fang.\n\n[[Category:White Fang characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:White Fang]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Native American characters]]"
