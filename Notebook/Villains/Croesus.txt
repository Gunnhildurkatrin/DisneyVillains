He is the owner of [[Atlantis City]].\n\n\n\n==Role in the [[Hercules (TV series)|series]]==\nIn \"[[Hercules and the Big Sink]]\", Croesus is the owner of [[Atlantis]] and the richest man in the world. He's so rich that even the [[Olympian Gods|Gods]] and the [[Fates]] will accept his bribes.\n\nWhen [[Cassandra (Hercules)|Cassandra]] predicts that Atlantis is going to sink, the tourists stop coming out of fear of getting drowned. An enraged Croesus bribes [[Hades]] to borrow [[Pain and Panic]], who he sent to kidnap Cassandra and the [[Fates]] to convince people that Cassandra's vision is completely false. After they do so, he confronts Cassandra who admits that she made the vision up and agrees to make a public confession on the matter.\n\nHowever, Cassandra has a real vision of Atlantis sinking. Enraged, Croesus imprisons Cassandra and [[Homer]]. Later, he is confronted by [[Hercules]], who figured out that he is behind Cassandra's kidnapping. To deal with him, Croesus bribes [[Poseidon]] to send Scylla to deal with Hercules. The fighting between the two leads to Atlantis getting cut from the Tapestry of Fate, causing Atlantis to sink and fulfilling Cassandra's vision. Croesus tries to get [[Hades]] to help him but the Lord of the Underworld refuses to help him because the bank containing all his money just sank, therefore, making his checks worthless (he only came back to reclaim Pain and Panic). When Atlantis sinks, Croesus goes down with it, a victim of a catastrophe he himself set in motion.\n\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nAtlantis_City_sunk.jpg|Croesus' tower\nBigSink.png\nBigSink2.png|Croesus with Hades\nBigSink3.png\nBigSink4.png\nBigSink5.png\nCroesus and the Fates.png|\"Let me be the first to say ''danke schoen''.\"\nBigSink6.png\nBigSink7.png\nBigSink8.png|Croesus orders Pain and Panic to imprison Cassandra and Homer\nBigSink9.png\nBigSink10.png\nBigSink11.png\nBigSink12.png|Croesus' defeat (later death)\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n* The show's depiction of Croesus is a parody of [[Donald Trump]], his various Trump-branded skyscrapers, and the casinos he owned in Atlantic City, New Jersey.\n\n{{Hercules}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Greek characters]]\n[[Category:Hercules characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Greek Mythology]]\n[[Category:Villains]]"
