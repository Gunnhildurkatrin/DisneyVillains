She then meets\u00a0[[Ayam Aghoul]] and his shadow. Ayam reveals his plan to send his shadow to the world of the living and separate the mortals' shadows from them. Farabu realized that separating people from their shadows will send them to the netherworld when the day is up but Ayam traps Farabu in a giant spiderweb after trying to foil his diabolical plan. Later, [[Aladdin (character)|Aladdin]] and [[Genie]] go to her. At first, she mistakes them for ghouls, but then she realizes that their shadows have been stolen by Ayam's shadow. Genie tries to free her but his magic proves useless against Aghoul's. Ayam appears and throws exploding skulls at Aladdin and Genie. The two make Ayam throw it at them again and when he does, the skeleton explodes in front of Farabu, making her free from the web. Farabu makes Ayam's shadow disappear. Enraged, Ayam is about to throw a skull at her, but Genie tackles him. Without a shadow, Ayam is forced to return to the Netherworld, thus breaking his spell and restoring everyone's shadows. Farabu then tells Aladdin that now that Ayam's gone, they can all get some sleep.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nSk1.jpg\nSk2.jpg\nSk3.jpg\nSk4.jpg\nSk6.jpg\nSk9.jpg\nSk14.jpg\nSk17.jpg\nSk18.jpg\nSk20.jpg\nSk24.jpg\nSk25.jpg\nSk26.jpg\nSk29.jpg\nSk30.jpg\nSk34.jpg\nSk68.jpg\nSk69.jpg\nSk70.jpg\nSk73.jpg\nSk74.jpg\nSk75.jpg\nSk76.jpg\nSk101.jpg\nSk103.jpg\nSk116.jpg\nSk120.jpg\nSk121.jpg\nSk122.jpg\nSk125.jpg\nSk131.jpg\nSk132.jpg\nSk136.jpg\nSk138.jpg\nSk139.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Aladdin}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Aladdin characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Goddesses]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
