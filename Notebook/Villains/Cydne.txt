He is voiced by [[Frank Welker]].\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[101 Dalmatians: The Series]]''===\nCydne lives in the swamp that borders the [[Dearly Farm]]. Despite the fact that he seldom leaves the farm, he has proven time and time again that he is a force to be reckoned with whenever creatures do venture into the swamp; though Cydne has been known to leave the swamp if he has a good reason. Due to his fierce nature, [[Swamp Rat]] often hires Cydne along with [[Steven]] in order to intimidate people into seeing things\u00a0his way, though Cydne enjoys helping his boss out because he realizes that he'll get the chance to devour some creatures in the process.\n\nCydne\u00a0appears in \"[[It's\u00a0a Swamp Thing|It's&nbsp;a Swamp Thing]]\", where Swamp Rat tells the [[Dalmatian Puppies|Dalmatians]] that he sold the [[Colonel]]'s scarf to Cydne. When [[Spot Chicken|Spot]] tries to ask him about it, Cydne figures they're charity collectors and comments how \"[He] gave at the office.\"\u00a0[[Cadpig]] then tries to talk to him, claiming that Cydne has inner pains and suggests that they have a group hug. Seeing this as an opportunity to get some food, Cydne plays along by wrapping himself around the pups and nearly squeezing them to death. He then tells them how he sold the scarf to Steven before the pups pop out from his grip, and he gets knotted up as a result, claiming them to be \"sssslippery little ssssuckers.\"\n\nCydne's largest role in the series was\u00a0in \"[[Bad to the Bone (101 Dalmatians: The Series)|Bad to the Bone]]\", where [[Rolly]] fakes a fight with Cydne Snake to get [[Mooch (101 Dalmatians)|Mooch]]'s gang off his back, which causes Mooch to let Rolly join his team. However, Rolly soon manages to alienate his true friends so that he can remain popular. As [[Dumpling]] is searching the swamp for some mushrooms, she is caught in Cydne's coils, and she tells him what Rolly's new title is. He later confronts and restrains Rolly on the Dearly Farm and gets him to confess that the fight was really with an empty snakeskin in front of all the Dalmatians. He lets Rolly loose after that before commenting that the earring didn't work as a good look for Rolly.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\">\nSwampRatCydneSteven2.png|Cydne with Steven and Swamp Rat\nCydne_the_Water_Snake_2.gif\nItsASwampThing28.jpg|Cydne with Spot\nItsASwampThing31.jpg\nItsASwampThing33.jpg\nItsASwampThing34.jpg\nItsASwampThing35.jpg|Cydne squeezing Lucky, Rolly, Capig and Spot\nSplishingAndSplashing19.jpg\nMcDonald's Disney 101 Dalmatians Flip Car.jpg|Cydne 1998 McDonald's car set\nFriskyBusiness54.jpg\nBad to the Bone01.jpg\nBad to the Bone02.jpg\nBad to the Bone03.jpg\nBad to the Bone04.jpg\nBad to the Bone05.jpg|Cydne with Dumpling\nBad to the Bone06.jpg\nBad to the Bone07.jpg\nBad to the Bone08.jpg\nBad to the Bone09.jpg\nBad to the Bone10.jpg\nBad to the Bone18.jpg\nBad to the Bone11.jpg\nBad to the Bone12.jpg\nBad to the Bone13.jpg\nBad to the Bone21.jpg\nBad to the Bone16.jpg\nBad to the Bone22.jpg\nBad to the Bone14.jpg\nCydne&amp;Spot01.png\nCydne&amp;Spot02.png\nSteven&amp;Cydne01.png|Cydne with Steven\nSteven&amp;Cydne02.png\nSteven&Cydne03.png\nSteven&amp;Cydne04.png\nSteven&amp;Cydne05.png\nSteven&amp;Cydne06.png\nSteven&amp;Cydne07.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{101 Dalmatians}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Snakes]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:101 Dalmatians characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
