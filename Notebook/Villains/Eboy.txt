He is an [[Internet]] netizen that serves as the embodiment of the eBay notification system.\n\n==Background==\nThe Eboy (which is merely a nickname given by Ralph) is tasked with reminding eBay shoppers of their bids, purchases, and other business in relation to the site. Eboy is incredibly chipper and speaks with 1950s-esque idioms. He has a habit of mistaking the names of shoppers.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nThe Eboy is a Netizen with light blue skin, dark blue curly hair, teal eyes, and wears a bellhop uniform that consists of a black hat with a blue stripe and a blue letter \"'''e'''\" to show that he works for eBay, a blue long-sleeve shirt with white buttons, a white bow tie, white gloves, black shorts, white cuffs with buttons, and black dress shoes.\n\n==Role in the film==\nThe Eboy first appears notifying [[Wreck-It Ralph (character)|Ralph]] and [[Vanellope von Schweetz|Vanellope]] that their bid on the ''[[Sugar Rush]]'' steering wheel would expire in 8 hours.\n\nHe later appears at [[BuzzzTube]] when Ralph and [[Yesss]] try to fix a problem, saying that their bid on the steering wheel would expire in 30 minutes.\n\nAfter Yesss has fixed the problem, Eboy shows up again, saying that the steering wheel is ready to be purchased. Ralph then takes a ride to eBay with him.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the UK version, he is voiced by Daniel Middleton, also known as [https://www.youtube.com/user/TheDiamondMinecart DanTDM] on YouTube. Like the [[Wreck-It Ralph (film)|first film]], however, this version did not end up on the UK home video release.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nRBTI - Eboy clip 1.jpg|Eboy talking to Ralph\nRBTI - Eboy clip 2.jpg\nRBTI - Eboy clip 3.jpg|Eboy with the eBay alert sign\nRBTI Japanese Trailer 6.jpg|Eboy at [[BuzzzTube]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nRalph Breaks the Internet.jpeg|Ralph Breaks the Internet poster featuring Eboy\nEboy concept.jpg|Concept art\nEboy model sheet.jpg|Model sheet\nEboy wireframe.jpg|Wireframed Eboy\nEboy.jpg\nEarly concept eboy.jpg|Early concept art\nThe Art of Ralph Breaks the Internet.jpeg|Design\n</gallery>\n\n{{Wreck-It Ralph}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Wreck-It Ralph characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Programs]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
