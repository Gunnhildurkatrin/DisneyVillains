They regularly steal and/or eat the food in [[Rabbit's garden|his garden.]] Rabbit has tried many methods to get rid of these pests with little or no success, as they usually outsmart him. However, Rabbit has occasionally managed to drive the crows away by using tactical force, such as building a makeshift machine to torture the crows and make them flee. In some instances, [[Winnie the Pooh|Pooh]] (or someone else) would somehow frighten the crows away instead of Rabbit. In \"[[Tigger Got Your Tongue]]\", they anonymously stole vegetables from under Rabbit's garden and were given the name \"'''the Nobodies'''\". They are last seen in \"[[Owl's Well That Ends Well]]\", when Owl's singing frightens them away from Rabbit's garden, causing them to flee and never come back.\n\n==Trivia==\n* The crows' designs are very similar to the crows from ''[[Dumbo (1941 film)|Dumbo]]'', but as normal non-anthropomorphic crows. while the ones seen in \"[[A Very, Very Large Animal]]\" are much more devious and scary compared to their goofy-looking selves in the other episodes.\n* In the first season, the crows' cawing was provided using stock sound effects (largely Hanna-Barbera's crow sound effects), but starting in the second season, [[Frank Welker]] began providing more unique caws for them.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nTNAOWTP - Adult Crow.jpg|An adult crow from \"[[A Very, Very Large Animal]]\"\nCrows' defeat - 1.jpg|The Crows' defeat (\"[[Owl's Well That Ends Well]]\")\nRabbit confident special.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Winnie the Pooh}}\n[[Category:Crows]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Winnie the Pooh characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]"
