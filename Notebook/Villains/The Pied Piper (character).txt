By playing his pipe, he hypnotizes them into leaving the town and and sends them in pursuit of a giant illusionary piece of cheese.\n\nHowever, the mayor and people of Hamelin show\u00a0themselves to be\u00a0thankless by giving him only a single gold coin instead of the promised bag of gold; claiming that the rats left of their own accord while the Piper played on his instrument. Incensed by their betrayal and deciding that their children deserved better than to be allowed to grow up like the corrupt townspeople, The\u00a0Piper uses his music to lead all\u00a0the village children\u00a0out of Hamelin and\u00a0into an enchanted world, where they can play and laugh all day long.\n\n===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===\n{{Main|Peter Pan (character)#Once Upon a Time}}\nIn this show, the Pied Piper is revealed to be an identity of [[Peter Pan (character)|Peter Pan]],\u00a0who\u00a0appears in the third season. [[Rumplestiltskin]] returns home and discovers his son [[Neal Cassidy|Baelfire]] is missing. He tracks him to a village, where the villagers explain that their children are missing as well, lured out of their beds by a Pied Piper in the night. This gives Rumplestiltskin a plan to confront the individual as he waits in the night until he hears the piper's call and moments later witnesses children climbing out windows and following the music. Rumplestiltskin then discovers a group of children masked and costumed, dancing wildly around a fire.\n\nHe then tries to find Baelfire amongst the children, and confronts the Pied Piper, who is revealed to be [[Peter Pan#Once Upon a Time|Peter Pan]], an old acquaintance of Rumplestiltskin's. After saying it has been a long time, Pan explains that only boys who feel unloved can hear his pipe, which is why Rumplestiltskin can hear him. Pan dares Rumplestiltskin to ask Baelfire if he wants to go back home with him or stay with Pan, stating that Rumple is afraid of what his son's answer might be. But Rumplestiltskin finds Baelfire, and uses his magic to take him back to their home. Rumplestiltskin tries to explain that Pan wanted to hurt him, as Rumplestiltskin has known Pan since he was a boy and that he betrayed him. Baelfire reveals Pan told him about the deal, that if he had been asked to go home, he would have. However his father didn't ask.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nPiedpiper.jpg\nTumblr_m1teegBfy51r3jmn6o1_1280.png\nOld King Cole 1252419368 1 1933.jpg|The Pied Piper as he appeared with different colors in the ''Silly Symphony'' short ''[[Old King Cole]]''\nOld King Cole 1252419368 0 1933.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[File:CG5g483WgAA50-m.jpg|thumb|236x236px]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pied Piper, The}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Silly Symphonies characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:German characters]]"
