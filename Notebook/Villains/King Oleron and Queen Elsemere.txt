You think you can blink those pretty little eyes and I\u2019ll melt like Mums and Daddy did.|The Red Queen making a statement before the battle.}}\nThough they do not appear in the film, they are referenced by [[Red Queen|Iracebeth]] on Frabjous day when the White and Red armies prepare for battle.\n\n===''[[Alice Through the Looking Glass]]''===\nOleron and Elsemere first appear when [[Alice Kingsleigh]] goes back in time to Horunvendush Day at Witzend. They are seen attending [[White Queen|Mirana]]'s coming of and their eldest daughter's coronation. It is there where they witness the failed attempt of coronating Iracebeth, beginning with [[Tarrant Hightopp]] mocking the [[Red Queen]] in front of everyone when the royal crown doesn't fit on her abnormally large head. This causes Iracebeth to melt down and threaten everyone who laughed at her. King Oleron, her father, deems her inappropriate to rule, and passes the title of queen to her younger sister, Mirana. Iracebeth is distraught, swearing revenge to the Hightopps due to Tarrant's act.\n\nThey are seen again when Alice goes back in time to the past Fell Day event. A statue of King Oleron is displayed on the town of Witzend in the past event. In the castle of Witzend, a child Iracebeth and her sister Mirana are in the kitchen, enjoying the tarts their mother, Queen Elsemere, baked. Mirana complains that Iracebeth ate all the tarts but one; Iracebeth replies that Mirana can eat the crumbs, angering her sister. The Queen orders the girls to leave the kitchen; they do as they're told, but Mirana returns and takes the last tart without her mother noticing. She eats it in the bedroom she shares with Iracebeth, shoving the crumbs to under her sister's bed. As Iracebeth enters to feed her ant farm, Queen Elsemere notices that the last tart disappeared and confronts the sisters in their bedroom; she notices the crumbs under Iracebeth's bed and asks if she ate it. Iracebeth denies the accusation and pleads to Mirana to confess what she did; Mirana, however, lies by denying that she ate the last tart. With the crumbs under Iracebeth's bed being the \"proof\" that she ate it, Queen Elsemere accuses Iracebeth of being a liar. Shocked by her sister's lie and the accusation of her mother, Iracebeth starts to cry and runs away from the castle. With Elsemere and Mirana in pursuit, Iracebeth slips on the snowy ground, falls, and hits her head on the edge of a monument adorned with white roses. Her head immediately starts to deform due to the internal bleeding. As she is rescued by the people of Witzend take her back to the castle, she curses the white roses; it is clear that the accident not only damaged her appearance, but her personality too.\n\nAfter the present Iracebeth and Mirana travel to the past Fell Day event, the two observe the past versions of themselves looking at the past version of Elsemere to which the present Mirana begins recapping of what she did wrong to the Red Queen just before the past versions of Mirana and Iracebeth get engulfed by the time rust, due to the catastrophe the present Iracebeth caused, followed by Elsemere who was also engulfed in the rust, alongside the statue of King Oleron as everything in the Fell Day event gets caught in the time rust, as it continues spreading across Underland. However, everything is restored back to normal when the Chronosphere is put back in place in Time's Castle in the present, which frees everything caught in the time rust.\n\n=== Depiction ===\nThey appear to represent a Red King and White Queen.  Due to this, both of their daughters are in shades of pink to represent both their parents.\n\nTie novels allude to the King having to break up fights between the Lion and the Unicorn to maintain his crown.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nalice-lookingglass-movie-screencaps.com-5538.jpg\nalice-lookingglass-movie-screencaps.com-5555.jpg\nalice-lookingglass-movie-screencaps.com-5688.jpg\nalice-lookingglass-movie-screencaps.com-5740.jpg\nalice-lookingglass-movie-screencaps.com-5759.jpg\nalice-lookingglass-movie-screencaps.com-5765.jpg\nalice-lookingglass-movie-screencaps.com-5772.jpg\nalice-lookingglass-movie-screencaps.com-5781.jpg\nalice-lookingglass-movie-screencaps.com-5797.jpg\nalice-lookingglass-movie-screencaps.com-5803.jpg\nalice-lookingglass-movie-screencaps.com-5829.jpg\nalice-lookingglass-movie-screencaps.com-5831.jpg\nalice-lookingglass-movie-screencaps.com-6962.jpg\nalice-lookingglass-movie-screencaps.com-6980.jpg\nalice-lookingglass-movie-screencaps.com-6992.jpg\nalice-lookingglass-movie-screencaps.com-7319.jpg\nalice-lookingglass-movie-screencaps.com-7635.jpg\nalice-lookingglass-movie-screencaps.com-7641.jpg\nalice-lookingglass-movie-screencaps.com-7671.jpg\nalice-lookingglass-movie-screencaps.com-7699.jpg\nalice-lookingglass-movie-screencaps.com-7715.jpg\nalice-lookingglass-movie-screencaps.com-7810.jpg\nalice-lookingglass-movie-screencaps.com-7892.jpg\nalice-lookingglass-movie-screencaps.com-7898.jpg\nalice-lookingglass-movie-screencaps.com-10265.jpg\nalice-lookingglass-movie-screencaps.com-10293.jpg\nalice-lookingglass-movie-screencaps.com-10313.jpg\nalice-lookingglass-movie-screencaps.com-10322.jpg\nalice-lookingglass-movie-screencaps.com-5916.jpg\nalice-lookingglass-movie-screencaps.com-7878.jpg\nalice-lookingglass-movie-screencaps.com-7903.jpg\nQueen Elsemere.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Alice in Wonderland}}\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Kings]]\n[[Category:Queens]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]"
