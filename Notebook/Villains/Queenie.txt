She is a royal queen bee, voiced by [[Sindy McKay]].\n\n==Role==\nOne day, when she was doing her royal duties, Queenie heard loud music. While she alone couldn't stand the sound, the rest of her swarm became hypnotized. Just the thought of losing her swarm made her woozy and faint, and it just so happened that she landed on top of [[Zipper]] while he was sunbathing. Zipper was suddenly lovestruck. After Zipper helped Queenie up, she asked him if he had seen her swarm. Knowing that this was an emergency, Zipper took Queenie by the hand and flew her off to Ranger Headquarters.\n\nOnce Queenie had met up with [[Chip and Dale]], she explained the problem. Of course, being a queen, she wasn't used to \"common\" things such as water, ragweed, or a cramped space on the [[Ranger Plane]]. When the Rangers encountered Queenie's missing swarm, Queenie was delighted to see them and promised to forget about the whole thing if they returned to the hive. But the swarm was still under hypnosis and attacked the Ranger Plane, bursting the balloon and causing the vehicle to land in a trash can. The swarm then robbed a music store and hijacked a pickup truck. With the Plane trashed, the Rangers hitched a ride on the truck, which finally stopped at a bug exterminating company.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\">\n109-02.jpg\nB 09-Shadow1 yes.jpg\n109-03.jpg\nQueenyHairs1 neat.jpg\nQueenyHairs2 tousled.jpg\nQueenyHairs3 neat.jpg\nQueenie119.jpg\nWoozy Queenie.png\nQueenie137.jpg\nRisky Beesness 05.jpg|Zipper meets up with Queenie.\nZipperundqueenie.jpg\nQueenie140.png\nImagesCA0YKVPR.jpg\nRisky Beesness 09.jpg\nQueenie163.jpg\nBqueen.jpg\nRisky Beesness 10.jpg\nQueenie172.jpg\nRisky Beesness 13.jpg\nQueenie180.jpg\nMuddyqueenie.gif\nQueenie184.jpg\nQueenie 09.jpg\nQueenie202.jpg|\"I am your true queen!
