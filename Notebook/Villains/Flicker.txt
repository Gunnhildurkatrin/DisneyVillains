Felipe is the only tool that can talk to him, though he is slowly picking up English. He was originally owned by Uncle Hugo and later given Manny. As of ''Handy Manny's School for Tools'', he appears to be fully bilingual. He is currently the \"youngest\" tool.\n\n==Looks==\nFlicker is an orange and blue Flashlight. He has freckles underneath his eyes. [[w:c:handymanny:Turner|Turner]] described him as a \"cute, little guy\". Flicker is revealed to be four inches in height as shown in [[w:c:handymanny:Manny's School for Tools|Manny's School for Tools]]\u00a0when [[w:c:handymanny:Stretch|Stretch]] measured him.\n\n==Personality==\nFlicker is extremely cheerful, affectionate and excitable. Flicker seems to love spots as seen in \"[[w:c:handymanny:Manny's Makeover|Manny's Makeover]]\"\u00a0when he became distracted by Manny's shirt when he's supposed to turn on his light for Manny. He later got sad when he put on a different shirt that [[w:c:handymanny:Mrs. Lopart|Mrs. Lopart]] gave him. Flicker seems to love food cause when Flicker sees food he wants to eat it and seems to love the taste or smell. The love for food was revealed in \"[[w:c:handymanny:Elliot's New Job|Elliot's New Job]]\" when Flicker wanted to eat popcorn. Flicker is just proud of his light and believes he's the one and only light source. Flicker is shown to also know how to communicate with birds as shown in \"[[w:c:handymanny:Pat Lightly|Pat Lightly]]\" when he talked to a bird. Whenever Flicker turns on his light he says \"Luz! Luz!\". For Flicker to turn on his light they ask him \"Flicker, Luz, por favor\". Flicker loves to shout Spanish phrases. When he's excited he flashes his light.\u00a0\n\nFlicker also has a fondness of soft, fluffy things when in \"[[w:c:handymanny:Picture Perfect|Picture Perfect]]\" when he wanted to buy a pillow. Flicker doesn't like libraries but seems to enjoy looking at picture books as shown in \"[[w:c:handymanny:The Great Donate|The Great Donate]].\" Flicker really dislikes loud noises or constant sounds that cause him to become overwhelmed and screams \"Ay! Ay! Ay!\" so loud that Manny can hear it. Flicker got quieter in season 3.\u00a0\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFlicker meets the Tools.png\nFlicker as the Spotlight.png\nFlicker meets Kelly.png\nFlicker.png\nFlicker-2.png\nFlicker's Debut.png\nManny meets Flicker.png\nManny-tools-guitar.png\nManny-tools2.png\nManny-tools.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Handy Manny}}\n[[Category:Magical Objects]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Handy Manny characters]]\n[[Category:Playhouse Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Special Agent Oso characters]]\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Tools]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]"
