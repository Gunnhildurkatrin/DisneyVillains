The task is proven to be complicated, as they were disappointed by the contestants who entered the parade and rejected everyone who participated on it. Just as they were to give up, they saw Miss Bonbon (the Sugar Cookie Girl) at the end of the parade and unanimously, they named her the Queen of the parade, accidentally breaking their post and carry her to her throne to crown her as their queen.\n\nThen they give her the task of choosing a King who will marry her, by presenting numerous suitors available for her, but when she refuses them all, they try to convince her to marry one of them or all of three at the same time, but their attempt was in vain as [[Hobo Cookie]]\u00a0arrived at that precise moment while he was escaping the cookie guards. At the request of Girl Cookie, the Hobo Cookie is chosen as the king and they accept it.\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\n\nOne of the Judges appears briefly in the film ''[[Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse]]'', fainting after he sees [[Ludwig Von Drake]] eating a gingerbread man, much to their horror.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nMisspineapple.jpg\n22407.jpg\n076-012judgement.jpg\nTumblr mzeqcpIeo01r3jmn6o1 1280.png\nHobo in Cookie Carnival.jpg\nHobo Cookie in House of Mouse.png|One of the Judges and [[Hobo Cookie]] in ''[[House of Mouse]]''.\nHouse Of Mouse - (Ep. 46)5.jpg\n44-4-.jpg |Concept art of a previous design of one of the judges crowning the Cookie queen\nCookie_Carnival_Poster_A.jpg\n1935_COOKIE_CARNIVAL.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Foods]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Silly Symphonies characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Character trios]]\n[[Category:Judges]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]"
