'''Experiment 383''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]]. He is designed to hypnotize people into obeying the next order or suggestion they hear; snapping one's fingers will break the victim's trance. His one true place is hypnotizing people at children's parties.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nSwirly is a troublesome experiment, although very mute at that. He is quite active with his hypnosis, as it is performed at the most inadequate of times to humiliate others, but he is otherwise harmless. He often stares into space when not using his powers, being somewhat blank-minded.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nSwirly is a small koala-like experiment with desaturated blue fur and a small doglike tail. Most of the time, he appears hunched and expressionless. His head and facial features are very large in proportion to his body, although there is a small antenna on the middle of his head. His eyes are black and pupil-less (but become white swirling lines when using his powers) and has large rabbit-like ears.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nSwirly possesses the ability to hypnotize anyone who looks into his eyes, forcing them to obey the next order or suggestion they hear, by making his eyes swirl. His victims will snap out of their trances once they hear someone snap their fingers; also, if no order or suggestion is heard within a few minutes, the effect wears off.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment 383 was the 383rd genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Jacques von H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to hypnotize his victims into obeying the next order or suggestion they heard. 383 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch |Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai, with 383's pod landing on a [[Lahui Beach|beach]]\u00a0shore.\n\nWhen a small wave washed over the shore, 383's pod got wet, activating the experiment. 383 then hypnotized a surfer, who witnessed his activation, and left the scene.\n\nAfter hypnotizing [[Ice Cream Man|a tourist]], 383 was discovered by [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Stitch]], but just before they could take action, [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] ambushed them and captured 383 in a containment orb. 383 was soon caught in a fight between Lilo, Stitch and Gantu, which ended with Lilo and Stitch successfully retrieving 383.\n\nLilo and Stitch then took 383, named Swirly, back to their\u00a0[[Lilo's House|house]], where they learned about his powers. They shortly after tried to hide Swirly from a strict [[Nani Pelekai|Nani]] when she arrived home from work. However, in the ensuing chaos, Swirly managed to hypnotize both Lilo and Stitch and escape outside.\n\nGantu later recaptured Swirly\u00a0and was\u00a0briefly hypnotized by the latter back at\u00a0[[Gantu's Ship|his ship]]. [[Reuben|Experiment 625]]\u00a0was fascinated by this and amused himself by making Gantu do silly stuff. [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]\u00a0also became intrigued after seeing this, and toyed with Gantu a bit before snapping him out of his trance.\n\nLater, Gantu arrived at the studio, where he used Swirly to hypnotize the manager into putting him on the ''Look at This!'' show, which was part of H\u00e4msterviel's clever scheme. Gantu then planned to have Swirly turn the show's viewers into slaves. Lilo and Stitch, who just so happened to be on the show, were still under Swirly's hypnosis from before.\n\n[[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], who was watching the show on TV back home, soon found out what was going on. He then came to the show in person and managed to snap Lilo and Stitch out of their trances so they could rescue Swirly.\n\nGantu prepared to hypnotize\u00a0the show's viewers into slaves using Swirly, but Lilo and Stitch pulled the plug on Gantu's charade\u00a0by recapturing Swirly. He was later found a one true place hypnotizing guests at a children's party that Stitch had won from being on the show, with [[Mertle Edmonds|Mertle]] becoming one of Swirly's victims.\n\nIn \"[[The Asteroid]]\", Swirly was one of the six experiments that Stitch convinced to come with him and Lilo to save Earth from an approaching asteroid. Along the journey, Swirly hypnotized the\u00a0extraterrestrial asteroid squatter to prevent him from\u00a0distracting Lilo and the others as they safely diverted the asteroid using the [[Jumba's Ship|ship]]'s hyperdrive engine.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nThe first 624 experiments, including Swirly, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium\u00a0to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]], and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nSwirly participated in the following battle between the experiments and the\u00a0[[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]] by hypnotizing attacking Leroys.\n\nHowever, the Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's failsafe.\n\n===''[[Stitch!]]''===\nSwirly made a cameo appearance in the ''Stitch!'' anime as one of the experiments in [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s [[Prison Asteroid K-37|prison cell]]. He made another appearance where [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]] used him to hypnotize [[Stitch]] into fighting for the alien scientist. Gantu is also hypnotized by Swirly, this time made to believe he is a scared chicken. Dr. H\u00e4msterviel notes that he should've hypnotized Gantu sooner, and decides to keep him him a trance. For the rest of the episode, he is seen in the background acting like a chicken, and even tries to lay an egg. This episode also featured [[Plasmoid]] and [[Splodyhead]] who helped combat Stitch while he was under Swirly's hypnosis.\n\nSwirly later appeared in the special ''Stitch and the Planet of Sand'', where he is captured by Dr. H\u00e4msterviel. After breaking free, Swirly finds Gantu and hypnotizes him once again. This time, he makes Gantu destroy several of H\u00e4msterviel's robots. Later, Swirly is seen at a party with the rest of the experiments, playing cards with Gantu, who is still hypnotized. \n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*In [[Swirly (episode)|his debut]], Swirly's fur color is green, but in promotional artwork and all of his other animated appearances, including ''[[Stitch!]]'', his\u00a0fur color is blue.\n*When Swirly hypnotizes the [[Ice Cream Man]], his eyes can be seen.\n*Swirly's\u00a0[[Experiment Pods|pod]] color is yellow.\n*Swirly's head, antenna, and ears appear in the online game ''[[Jumba's Lab (Game)|Jumba's Lab]]''.\n*Swirly is one of the few known experiments whose powers Stitch is not immune to.\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
