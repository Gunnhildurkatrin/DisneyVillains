She is a good friend of [[Sofia the First (character)|Princess Sofia]], [[Princess Hildegard]], [[Princess Amber]], [[Princess Clio]], and [[Princess Vivian]].\n\nHer parents are [[Emperor Quon]] and [[Empress Lin-Lin]], her little brother is [[Prince Jin|Jin]], and they are the Imperial Family of Wei-Ling. Jun has a very good memory, recalling old stories from her mom and able to describe the various statues in her garden. She's a very talented bamboo flute player, able to even calm down lagoon lizards and get a ride from them. She has a playbook for [[Dazzleball]] in her possession that she tried to get Amber to read and usually failed to her annoyance.\n\n==Role in the Series==\nJun made her debut in the [[Sofia the First: Once Upon a Princess|series premiere]]\u00a0and\u00a0is portrayed as a minor character throughout the series. She is often seen hanging around with her friends and her brother Prince Jin.\n\nJun's first major role came in \"[[Princesses to the Rescue!]]\". Jun became worried about her brother when she heard about the [[Jade Jaguar]] but agreed with her father that she should let the men handle it. However, in the end, she agreed to go with Sofia who, with Mulan's help, taught her she was stronger than she thought. With Mulan's help, Sofia, Amber, and Jun managed to rescue their brothers and fathers.\n\n==Trivia==\n*She is the fifth princess to be Chinese (following [[Fa Mulan|Mulan]], [[Ting-Ting, Su, and Mei]].)\n*Her name can either mean \"supreme\" or \"talented\" in Chinese.\n*Her voice actress, Michaela Zee, is the daughter of [[Ming-Na Wen]], who voiced [[Fa Mulan|Mulan]].\n*Princess Jun also visited the Enchancian Village once.\n*She is the only character not from Enchancia to meet a Disney Princess.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nThe Princess Test08.jpg\nVlcsnap-2013-10-13-11h33m20s67.png|\"Back from where?\"\nVlcsnap-2013-10-07-16h43m25s121.png\nPrincess Jun.png\nJunJin.jpg\nArgentina que ponarle limites a estos ni\u00f1os (2).png|Miss Fauna impressed with Jun's copy of her dress\nPrincesses-to-the-Rescue-1.png\nPrincesses-to-the-Rescue-13.png\nPrincesses-to-the-Rescue-26.png\nPrincesses-to-the-Rescue-25.png\nPrincesses-to-the-Rescue-20.png\nPrincesses-to-the-Rescue-18.png\nPrincesses-to-the-Rescue-16.png\nPlans that The Coach comes Up with.PNG\nThe Bamboo Kite 2.png\nThe Bamboo Kite 11.png\n</gallery>\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"medium\">\nHalloween Ball 8.JPG|Jun dressed as a leopard/cheetah\nThe Bamboo Kite banner Disney Junior.jpg|Promo for episode 'The Bamboo Kite'\nDisney-Sofia-The-First-Royal-Prep-Academy-Doll-Gift-Pack-0-6.jpg\ndisney-sofia-first-royal-prep-figures.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Sofia the First}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jun}}\n[[pt-br:Princesa Jun]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Asian characters]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Sofia the First characters]]\n[[Category:Princesses]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Chinese characters]]"
