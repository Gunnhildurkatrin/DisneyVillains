"{{Infobox character\n|image = Beau the Dog.jpg\n|films = ''[[Tangled]]'' (deleted)\n|alias = Prince Beau\n|alignment = Good\n|friends = [[Rapunzel]], [[Bastion]], [[Claire and Vince]]\n|enemies = Griffol, Evil Witch}}\n'''Beau''' was a supporting character intended to appear in earlier versions of ''[[Tangled]]''. He is notable in that he went through numerous changes throughout the film's production. While Beau ended up on the cutting room floor, he was evidently replaced by [[Maximus]] and [[Pascal]], two animal sidekicks who fulfilled Beau's purpose of being supporting characters and comic relief.\n\n==Role in the film==\nBeau's first iteration was that of being [[Rapunzel]]'s prince in ''Rapunzel Unbraided''. Based on the premise of the original film, Beau would have been somewhat similar to [[Prince Edward]] from ''[[Enchanted]]'', a prince with flair who was desperately in love with Rapunzel (who at the time was to be voiced by [[Kristin Chenoweth]]). An evil witch who despised happy endings decides to pull two humans from the real world, [[Claire and Vince]], who would have replaced Rapunzel and Beau. While Rapunzel is transformed into a squirrel, Beau would have been transformed into a basset hound.\n\nWhen the film went through a massive plot overhaul into ''Rapunzel'', Beau was repurposed as the pet dog to [[Bastion]], the new leading man and Rapunzel's love interest. He was to be his confident and loyal pet who provided comic relief.{{Citation needed}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*He slightly resembles [[Toby (The Great Mouse Detective)|Toby]] from ''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]''.\n\n{{Tangled}}\n[[Category:Tangled characters]]\n[[Category:Deleted characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Pets]]"
