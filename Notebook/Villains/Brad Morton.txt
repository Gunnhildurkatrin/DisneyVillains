He usually thinks he is a hot shot, but at some points he just utterly fails.\n\nHe is two years older than [[Jake Long]], making him 16 because he was held back twice in elementary school for failing 3rd grade<ref name=\"young\">[[Young at Heart]]</ref>.\n\nJake is frequently the target of Brad's abuse, despite also being popular. Usually by him flaunting something, such as a car<ref name=\"young\">[[Young at Heart]]</ref>, a large wad of money<ref>[[Fool's Gold]]</ref>, etc., in Jake's face. However, Jake almost always manages to get even either by himself or because of Brad's own actions backfiring.\n\n==Personality==\n[[File:The_Doppleganger_Gang_(8).jpg|thumb|250px|Brad Morton as he appears in Season Two]]Brad is very egotistical, constantly referring to himself as \"The Bradster\". He was a major foil to Jake getting a chance to spend time with Rose during school. He once took Rose on a date but dumped her for [[Jasmine (American Dragon: Jake Long)|Jasmine]], a girl Jake took to that dance unaware that she was a [[Nix]]<ref>[[Dragon Breath]]</ref>. Afterwards, he is oblivious to the fact she no longer likes him. He always tries to steal Rose away from Jake whenever they show up, but Rose has probably not forgiven him for ditching her for Jasmine, or the dance gave her an opportunity to see Brad's true personality.\n\nIt seems that Brad hides his fears and embarrassing secrets like his fear of the dark<ref>[[The Doppelganger Gang]]</ref> and dreaming of becoming a ballerina<ref>[[Dreamscape]]</ref> with his tough-guy attitude.\n\n==Family==\nHis father is a police officer and much like his son, picks on other people, including [[Jonathan Long]]<ref>[[Bite Father, Bite Son]]</ref>.\n\n==Age By Season==\n*Season 1: 14-15\n*Season 2: 15-16\n==Episode Appearances==\n===Season One===\n*\"[[Old School Training]]\" (cameo)\n*\"[[Dragon Breath]]\" (first appearance)\n*\"[[The Talented Mr. Long]]\"\n*\"[[Act 4, Scene 15]]\"\n*\"[[Shapeshifter]]\"\n*\"[[The Ski Trip]]\"\n*\"[[The Halloween Bash]]\"\n*\"[[Ring Around the Dragon]]\"\n*\"[[The Hunted]]\"\n\n===Season Two===\n*\"[[Half Baked]]\"\n*\"[[The Academy]]\"\n*\"[[The Doppelganger Gang]]\"\n*\"[[Breakout (American Dragon: Jake Long)|Breakout]]\" (cameo)\n*\"[[Dreamscape]]\"\n*\"[[Fool's Gold (American Dragon: Jake Long)|Fool's Gold]]\"\n*\"[[Haley Gone Wild]] (cameo)\n*\"[[Hairy Christmas]]\"\n*\"[[Switcheroo]]\"\n*\"[[The Love Cruise]]\"\n*\"[[Homecoming]]\" (cameo)\n*\"[[Young at Heart]]\"\n*\"[[Siren Says]]\"\n*\"[[Shaggy Frog]]\"\n*\"[[Magic Enemy Number One|Magic Enemy #1]]\"\n*\"[[A Ghost Story]]\"\n*\"[[Bite Father, Bite Son]]\"\n*\"[[Game On]]\"\n*\"[[Furious Jealousy]]\"\n*\"[[Being Human]]\" (final appearance)\n*\"[[The Hong Kong Longs]]\" (end credits)\n\n==Trivia==\n*Brad has taken piano lessons for 12 years, yet is still no better than a beginner<ref>[[The Talented Mr. Long]]</ref>.\n*Brad was suspended from school for pulling a cake bomb on [[Hans Rotwood|Principal Rotwood]] and was unable to participate in graduation<ref>[[Being Human]]</ref>.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink|Brad Morton}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}{{DEFAULTSORT:Morton, Brad}}\n\n{{American Dragon: Jake Long}}\n[[Category:American Dragon: Jake Long characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
