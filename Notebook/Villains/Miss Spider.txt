She wears a blue beret, a blue scarf, long black gloves and black high-heeled boots on each leg.\n\nMiss Spider also speaks in a [[France|French]] accent.\n\n==Personality==\nMiss Spider is a beautiful, kind, soft-spoken, brave, tough, feisty, strong, and confident creature who becomes a mother figure to [[James Henry Trotter|James]] who had just saved her from being killed by his [[Aunt Spiker|cruel]] [[Aunt Sponge|aunts]]. She was a loner as she initially \"preferred to be alone\", but she later warms up to the other bugs, etc. She is the love interest of Mr. Centipede.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[James and the Giant Peach]]''===\nShe is first seen as an ordinary spider in [[James Henry Trotter]]'s window. He tells her it is a bad idea to build her web there because his aunts, who hate spiders, might see her and try to kill her. He introduces himself to her and expresses his desire to go to [[New York City]] and shows her a special candle his parents gave him.\n\nThe next morning, [[Aunt Spiker]] and [[Aunt Sponge]] spot her, but James saves her, carries her outside, and tells her to leave as fast as she can. That night, James climbs inside the [[Giant Peach|peach]], having been transformed, and Miss Spider, who has been magically transformed into a giant along with the other bugs, assures him that no one will hurt him, although he does not recognize her.\n\nDuring their journey to New York City, she aids in a dangerous and desperate situation in which the crew on the peach has to fend off a [[Robot Shark|robot shark]]. Later on, the bugs and James decide to eat some of the peach so they won't be so hungry on their journey to New York, an event that Miss Spider chimes in on. That same night, when she is tucking the boy into bed using her web and his jacket, Miss Spider gets James to realize that she is the same spider whose life he had saved at his aunts' house. It is at this moment that James understands why she has cared for him so much during the journey. After she's done wrapping the boy up with her webbing, Miss Spider comforts James when he is confronted by the thoughts of his tortured past and kisses him goodnight, which is a further confirmation that she is like a mother to the boy now.\n\nShe later starts a romantic relationship with Centipede after he saves her and James from some [[Skeleton Pirates|Skeleton pirates]]. Although she and the others are separated from James following an attack from the [[Rhino (James and the Giant Peach)|Rhino]], they reunite with him and aid him in the capture of Spiker and Sponge, who had journeyed to New York to get James and the peach back. Miss Spider binds James' aunts up in her webbing, and they are taken away. She then lives in Central Park with James and the others and becomes the owner of \"Spider Club.\"\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Miss Spider's love interest is [[Mr. Centipede]], who often tries her patience. But as the series goes down, she soon falls in love with him.\n*Unlike her counterpart in the book, Miss Spider is shown to be a mother to James as the story progresses. They share a very important scene together in the middle of the film where she tucks him into bed using her string. This scene shows her to be loving and caring towards James, even going so far as to comfort him and kiss him on the forehead goodnight. It is a major scene that addresses her arc in the film. \n*During the set of when Miss Spider is normal-sized, Paul Terry (who played James) got bitten by the spider. This is why he never acted again.\n*She is one of the few female Disney characters to be seen smoking a cigar (though she actually borrowed it from Mr. Centipede).\n*In the book, she, along with the Silkworm (a character in the book), set up a factory to make ropes for tightrope walkers in New York City.\n\n{{James and the Giant Peach}}\n[[Category:James and the Giant Peach characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:French characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Spiders]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters in live-action films]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Deuteragonists]]"
