He is the Dalmatians' next door neighbor.\n\n== Background ==\n\n===Personality===\nConstantin craves peace, quiet and dignity, but he is ritually robbed of all three on a daily basis due to his dotty dog neighbours. Constantin enjoys hosting zen parties and yoga sessions for his fellow feline friends and Deepak, his spotty prot\u00e9g\u00e9. He lives a minimalist lifestyle in a sharp contrast to his messy neighbours.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nConstantin is a cat\u00a0with blue-grey colored fur. He has thick white eyebrows and white fur going from his muzzle\u00a0down to his chest and along his stomach.\n\nIn Concept art, Constantin would've been a black and white cat but it was unknown if his fur color was changed during production or it would've been his original fur color.\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nConstantin Character ReferenceDL.jpg|Constantin Character Reference\n</gallery>\n\n{{101 Dalmatians}}\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:101 Dalmatians characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n\n[[de:Constantin]]"
