She was first seen when she caught [[Scott Calvin]]'s son, [[Charlie Calvin|Charlie]], for defacing the walls of the gymnasium from the skylight. Initially she was going to suspend Charlie but was swayed by his father suggested that he do community service as punishment.\n\nAfter a few failed dates, Scott finds himself falling for Carol. He accompanies her in a sleigh to her school faculty Christmas party, which turns out to be dull and boring.\n\nUsing a little of his Christmas magic, he livens it up by presenting everyone with their childhood dream gifts (much like he did for [[Laura Miller|Laura]] and [[Neil Miller|Neil]] in the first film).\n\nHe makes a special presentation to Carol, and, with his last remnant of magic, wins her over and they kiss passionately.\n\nHowever, when Scott explains his reason for dating her as [[Santa Claus]], Carol balks, believing that he is mocking her childhood (where she was teased for believing in Santa) until Charlie manages to convince her by showing her his magic snow globe.\n\nLater on, [[Toy Santa]] wastes no time in tying him up with [[Curtis (Santa Clause)|Curtis]], but Charlie and a now-believing Carol spring him free by summoning the [[Tooth Fairy]] to fly them there after [[Lucy Miller|Lucy]] loses a tooth.\n\nHe goes after Toy Santa, who has already left with the sleigh, riding Chet, a reindeer-in-training, and they both battle over the reindeer. With an army of elves, Carol, [[Bernard (Santa Clause)|Bernard]], Charlie, and Curtis lead a snowball war to overthrow the toy soldiers.\n\nDuring the battle, Toy Santa and Scott accidentally cause the sleigh to crash back into the village (as well as crashing on the rest of the toy soldiers). Toy Santa is forcibly restrained by the elves and is reduced to his normal six-inch height.\n\nScott marries Carol in a ceremony presided over by [[Mother Nature]] herself.\n\nHe transforms back into Santa, and Christmas proceeds as it always has and he and Carol have a three-month honeymoon to go on the next day.\n\nIn addition, Charlie reveals the truth to Lucy that he is the real Santa Claus.\n\n===''[[The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause]]''===\nCarol is now pregnant with her and Scott 's child.  Carol has adapted to being Mrs. Claus and is happy with their unique life.\n\nWhile content with Scott, she expresses sadness that she misses her parents who she has not seen since she became Mrs. Claus. As a result, [[Scott Calvin|Scott]] goes to [[Chicago]] with the [[Sandman (The Santa Clause)|Sandman]] (under the nickname of \"Sandy\") to take them to the North Pole.\n\nDue to the \"Secret of Santa\", Bud and Sylvia are under the impression that they have arrived in [[Canada]], rather than the North Pole. They are unaware of Scott and Carol's true identities, and simply believe Scott to be a toymaker. Carol plays along.\n\nAfter arriving, Bud and Sylvia meet [[Jack Frost]], whom they are told is an actor portraying him in their winter show. The two were frozen by him and were left this way for a majority of the rest of the film. Bud and Sylvia are later freed when they are warmed up by everyone. The pair also learned that they were wrong about Santa Claus not existing when it turns out their son-in-law Scott is Santa and they are amazed by this news. They also become grandparents when Carol gives birth to her son.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"185\">\nCarol Newman.png|Carol Newman-Calvin in ''[[The Santa Clause 2]]''.\nCarol Newman-Calvin(1).png|Carol Newman-Calvin as Mrs. Clause in ''[[ The Santa Clause 2]]''.\nCarol Newman-Calvin(2).png|Carol Newman-Calvin as Mrs. Clause in ''[[ The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause]]''.\n</gallery>\n\n{{Stubsection}}\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{The Santa Clause}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:The Santa Clause characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Deuteragonists]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Stepparents]]\n[[Category:Queens]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]"
