It has appeared in several Disney films, most notably the [[1940]] animated feature ''[[Fantasia]]'' and the [[2000]] CG Disney film ''[[Dinosaur]]''. Though not a dinosaur itself, it is often shown in association with them.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Fantasia]]''===\nA bunch of Pteranodons appear in ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' segment in ''Fantasia''. They are seen flying over head trying to catch prey in the ocean. Two of them were fighting over a squid and one, with a fish in his mouth, gets dragged into the water by a [[Tylosaurus]], causing him to drown. They are never seen again for the remainder of the segment but presumably went extinct in the mass extinction with the dinosaurs.\n\n===''[[Dinosaur]]''===\nOne Pteranodon is seen picking up [[Aladar]]'s egg from the water and flying towards [[Lemur Island]] to feed its children, only to get stopped by two [[Ichthyornis|birds]], causing it to drop the egg into the island. The species shown in this movie is ''Pteranodon sternbergi'', which some scientists think is a different creature called a ''{{WikipediaLink|Geosternbergia}}'', a close relative of the Pteranodon.\n\n===''[[Miles from Tomorrowland]]''===\nThe Pteranodon appears in the episode \"[[Dino World]]\", along side the [[Ankylosaurus]]. They are discovered to exist on another planet along many other earth dinosaurs. At the episode's climax, three Pteranodons chase the Callistos away after Loretta wakes up an Ankylosaurus.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Pterosaurs like Pteranodon are technically not dinosaurs, but belong to a separate group of flying reptiles.\n*In the game Disney's Dinosaur, the Pteranodon is named Flia.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pteranodon Pteranodon at Wikipedia]\n\n{{Fantasia}}\n{{Dinosaur}}\n{{Miles from Tomorrowland}}\n{{Toy Story}}\n{{Penn Zero: Part-Time Hero}}\n\ufeff{{DEFAULTSORT:Pteranodon}}\n[[Category:Prehistoric animals]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Fantasia characters]]\n[[Category:Dinosaur characters]]\n[[Category:Miles from Tomorrowland characters]]\n[[Category:Pterosaur]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Tarzan]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse (TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Toy Story characters]]\n[[Category:Penn Zero: Part-Time Hero characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric characters]]\n[[Category:Skeletons]]"
