I'm sorry I tried to suck the souls of all of your friends at the dance.|Jasmine apologizing to [[Jake Long|Jake]]}}\n'''Jasmine'''<ref>http://www.jeffgoode.com/tv/americandragon/characters/jasmine.htm</ref><ref>http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0387988/</ref> is a secondary character on [[Disney Channel]]'s animated series ''[[American Dragon: Jake Long]]''.\n==History==\n[[File:Jasmine_Nolan.jpg|thumb|left|Jasmine appears only in Season One]]Jasmine appears as a young human girl who is actually a [[Nix]]; a supernatural being who, under certain lunar conditions, transforms into a soul-sucking creature. She only appears in one episode<ref name=\"breath\">[[Dragon Breath]]</ref>, was mentioned by [[Fu Dog]] that she was hot<ref>[[Dragon Summit]]</ref>, was in the background wearing a light blue sweater-dress at the Ogre-Bowl<ref>[[Body Guard Duty]]</ref>, and was seen in a flashback<ref>[[The Ski Trip]]</ref> where [[Jake Long|Jake]] spins [[Rose]] at the dance floor and she was in the background sucking more souls (all in Season 1).\n\n==Physical Appearance==\nJasmine is a tall and slender young girl with long black hair and a beauty mark under her left eye. She usually wore a short crimson red dress with black high-heeled shoes. [[Jake Long]] found her to be very attractive, which is why he immediately approached her to invite her to his school dance the moment he saw her.\n\n==Personality==\n[[File:Dragon_Breath_(74).jpg|thumb|left|Jasmine is talking to Jake Long about taking her to the dance]]\nJasmine was a very friendly and outgoing individual. Even though she had only just met [[Jake Long|Jake]] at the [[Magus Bazaar]], she was so charmed she accepted his invitation to his school dance without any hesitation.\n\nJasmine is very much aware of her Nix side. Like anyone would upon meeting a stranger, she does not openly share that side of herself. However, she makes a point of warning him she needs to be home before the moon reaches the center of the night sky (she will turn into a [[Nix]] at that time). She insists on this several times during the episode, and even attempts to leave the dance when the time of her transformation grows near since she didn't want anyone to get hurt. She later apologized abundantly to Jake for the fiasco at the dance, which showed that she was not inherently evil despite the needs of being a Nix.\n\nWhen upset or in a bad mood, Jasmine will growl and her eyes will glow red, her [[Nix]] side dominating her negative emotions.\n\n==Nix Side==\n[[File:Nix.jpg|thumb|left|Jasmine transformed to a Nix]]In counterpoint to her sweetness, Jasmine turns out to be a magical soul-sucking creature knows as a Nix, in which form has a serpent tail instead of legs, scaly green skin, sharp claws, fangs, a set of black wings, and glowing red eyes. Jasmine transforms only when the moon reaches the center of the night sky and for the rest of the night until the moon sets, turning back to human form.\n\nDuring Jake's party, although she did attempt to leave before she would change, Jasmine morphed into Nix form and instinctively proceeded to sucks the souls out of the entire student body. She then engaged in a fight with Jake, who managed to defeat her with his incredibly smelly Dragon breath. The souls were returned to their rightful bodies \u2013 although there was a mix-up with a couple, like [[Trixie Carter|Trixie]] and [[Arthur Spudinski|Spud]] \u2013 before Jasmine was taken care of by [[Luong Lao Shi|Lao Shi]] and [[Fu Dog]] until moonset. When Jake eventually escorted her home, she apologized profusely for the trouble.\n\n==Episode Appearances==\n===Season One===\n*''[[Dragon Breath]]'' (first appearance)\n*''[[Dragon Summit]]'' (mentioned)\n*''[[Body Guard Duty]]'' (background cameo)\n*''[[The Ski Trip]]'' (flashback)\n\n==Quotes==\n*''\"Ah, no.
