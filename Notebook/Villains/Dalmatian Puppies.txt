Fifteen of them are [[Pongo]] and [[Perdita]]'s puppies, who are kidnapped by the evil [[Cruella De Vil]], and their parents journey off to go rescue them, eventually adopting the other 84.\n\n==Background==\nDespite the moniker, no version of the Dalmatian puppies has the same individuals; there are various groups of puppies across the franchise's adaptations.

While at [[Hell Hall]], the ancestral home of the De Vil family, it turns out that Cruella had also gotten 84 other Dalmatians from pet shops through legitimate means. It later turns out that Cruella wants to kill them all to use their fur for a spotted fur coat. Perdita and [[Pongo]] rescue the original fifteen and decide to adopt the other 84 as their children because they don't want them to be killed.\n\n===''[[101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure]]''===\nIn the sequel, the movie revolves around [[Patch]], who ends up being separated from his family. During the film, he meets their greatest canine hero (after their mother and father) [[Thunderbolt]], the star of their favorite [[The Thunderbolt Adventure Hour|television series]].\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\nThe puppies, along with other characters, appear in the television series ''House of Mouse''. Their most notable appearance is where [[Ludwig Von Drake]] names many Disney characters and says them as one falls off and lands on Pongo, with Ludwig commenting, \"They need another chair.\"\n\n===''[[101 Dalmatian Street]]''===\nSome of the 99 Dalmatian puppies that appear on the show are descendants of [[Pongo]] and [[Perdita]] on [[Delilah (101 Dalmatian Street)|Delilah]]'s side of the family. [https://bangumi.skyperfectv.co.jp/S/programId:240407/%7C According to a Japanese television guide,] before the two met, Delilah and Doug had fifteen puppies each, from previous relationships. After the two got together, they then had another fifteen puppies, before then adopting 54 more, both from rescue shelters and by taking in strays.\n\nTheir collars come in a variety of colors and designs. While their parents are at work, the puppies are being looked after by their eldest siblings, [[Dylan]] and [[Dolly (101 Dalmatian Street)|Dolly]].\n\n==Video games==\n===''[[Kingdom Hearts (game)|Kingdom Hearts]]''===\n[[File:99 Puppies.png|right]]\nThe puppies appear in the series as a quest Sora can partake during the game. At some point (likely following their capture by and subsequent rescue from Cruella De Vil) the Dalmatians' world was destroyed and they were separated from their parents. During the chaos, they were somehow bundled into groups of three and forced into chests which then landed in various worlds. During his journey, [[Sora]] can find and send them to [[Traverse Town]], where Pongo and Perdita are.\n\n==[[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Disney Parks]]==\nIn the Disney parks, the puppies are only seen in parades and shows such as [[Fantasmic!]] In the [[Disney's All-Star Movies Resort]] in [[Walt Disney World Resort]], a certain section is dedicated to ''One Hundred and One Dalmatians''. They were seen in [[Disneyland Paris]]' [[Disney's Maleficious Halloween Party]] during Cruella's scene. The puppies also play a role in [[Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom]]. One Dalmatian puppy can be seen in the window of the Fire Department at [[Mickey's Toontown]] at [[Disneyland]].\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the [[1985]] ''One Hundred and One Dalmatians'' book, which was part of the ''[[Disney's Wonderful World of Reading]]'' collection, [[Perdita]] gave birth to only ten puppies instead of fifteen. This was fixed for the [[1996]] re-issue of the book to match the movie.\n*In the [[1996]] [[101 Dalmatians (1996 film)|movie]], [[Anita Radcliffe|Anita]] originally said no when considering to take in the other 84 puppies, but [[Roger Radcliffe|Roger]] and [[Nanny]] talked her into it.\n*At various points in the first movie (most notably during the climax and ending), the puppies' barks and whimpers were recycled sound effects from [[Lady]], when she was a puppy, and [[Savage Sam (character)|Savage Sam]] from ''[[Old Yeller]]''. Specifically, their whimpers were from Lady, and their barks were from Savage Sam.\n*In ''[[Once Upon a Time]]'', the puppies appear in the title card of the episode \"[[Sympathy for the De Vil]]\". One puppy appeared in the episode \"Heroes and Villains\" by luring Belle into the hands of the Queens of Darkness.\n*Normally, the male puppies wear red collars, while the female puppies wear blue collars, but there are exceptions to certain puppies, regarding their appearances in other media. In the live-action films, the male pups wear blue collars, while the female pups wear pink (or red in tie-in material), while the collar colors are not gender specific in both ''[[101 Dalmatians: The Series]]'' and ''[[101 Dalmatian Street]]''.\n*In the original novel, four of the original fifteen puppies are named; these four being Lucky, Patch, Roly-Poly, and Cadpig. In the Disney adaptations, Roly-Poly's name is shortened to Rolly.\n\n{{101 Dalmatians}}\n{{Kingdom Hearts}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom Characters]]\n[[Category:Wonderful World of Color]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:101 Dalmatians characters]]\n[[Category:Once Upon a Time characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Dreams! characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney on Ice characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]"
