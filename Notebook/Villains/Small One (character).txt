He is a gentle miniature donkey past his prime. Long years of working hard have made him weak. Though he eats as much as the other donkeys, he cannot handle the same loads. He has a mental disability where his right ear never seems to stay straight up, giving him that \"Disney cuteness\" rating. He has strong feelings for the Boy and would give his life to help him, as he almost does at the Tanner's.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[The Small One]]''===\nSmall One lived with his young master in Nazareth at the stable where the Boy cares about him. However, due to a tough decision with his father who cannot afford to keep Small One, the boy was forced to sell him, as a result, but wanted to give him a good place to go in refusal much to his father's plan to sell the donkey, to his concern, telling him to listen what his father said. The Boy then takes good care of Small One by singing his friendship with him before getting ready to sleep.\n\nThe next day, Small One and the boy explore a busy town around the, where the Boy would find someone who would buy the donkey to which while asking a Roman soldier about someone who would deal with donkeys, he asks the Boy to ask the tanner. It is then found out that the tanner only wanted to kill him, just as the boy refuses to sell him. The Boy asks a nearby potter who would be able to buy him but he refuses. After another failed attempt to sell the donkey, three merchants point the boy to seek an auctioneer who would help the boy. The Boy attempts to sell Small One to the Auctioneer, but he refuses as the Auctioneer explains to him that the market he owns is a horse market. Noticing the Auctioneer's harmful actions to Small One, the Boy stops the Auctioneer from hurting the donkey, to which he and the about manage to escape from him in panic.\n\nThat night, the Boy ends up crying that no one would want to buy Small One from him just as he and the Boy walk around town with no one to buy the donkey. Suddenly, the boy approaches a man who is no other than [[Joseph]] who needs Small One to carry his wife to Bethlehem. The boy agrees to give Small One to Joseph who takes the donkey with him so that he can carry his wife to Bethlehem as the boy bids him a farewell before leaving. Joseph then takes Small One to carry his wife to Bethlehem as the Star of Bethlehem shines on the sky, marking the birth of the newborn king.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"left\">\nSmall One.jpg\nSmall One Donkey Close Up.jpg\nSmall One Donkey Head.jpg\nVirginmary.jpg|Small One carrying Mary to Bethlehem.\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Holiday Figures]]\n[[Category:Donkeys]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:The Small One characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
