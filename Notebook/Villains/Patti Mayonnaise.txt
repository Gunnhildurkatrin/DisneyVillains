She met Doug when he first moved to Bluffington, and he instantly fell in love with her. She is a very well-performing student in both academics and sports. She also founded her own softball team, \"Patti's Pulverizers\", after being expelled from the school team. She also gets jealous when Doug is with other girls too.\n\nEarlier in the series, while Doug had a huge crush on her, her feelings were only hinted at, though this was because the series was only from Doug's point of view. The first time her affections were explicitly shown was in \"Doug to the Rescue\" from the first season of the Nickelodeon series. She also mentions in \"Doug's Magic Act\", from the third season of the Nickelodeon series, that Doug is her favorite person to be with. In the Disney series, Guy Graham, an 8th grader, showed affection for her, though she is not appeared to be fully interested, only seeing him as a friend.\n\nIn ''[[Doug's 1st Movie]]'', she did never believe Doug that\u00a0Lucky Duck Lake was polluted,\u00a0and this caused her to end up going with Guy to the Valentine's Dance. However, after finding out that Guy was planning on revealing the monster to be destroyed, she ended her relationship with him and began to dance with Doug for the remainder of the movie.\n\nIn the final episode of the Disney series, she asks Doug out on a \"date-date\", thus causing the two to become an official couple.\n\nAt home, she lives with her father. Her mother died in a car accident, which her father was also in, but despite surviving, he started using a wheelchair as a result. It's unknown whether Patti was present during the accident.\n\n== Appearance ==\nOriginally, in the Nickelodeon series, Patti had longer hair and darker skin. She wears a skirt and sneakers.\n\nIn the Disney series, Patti has a slightly lighter skin color, and her classic wavy blonde hair is now straight and is styled in a pixie cut. She wears blue hoop earrings, a blue-and-pink polka dot long-sleeved shirt, navy blue jeans, and pink slip-on shoes.\n\nIn ''Doug's 1st Movie'', Patti wears a pink glitter headband and a one-shouldered blue gown on the red carpet. At the Funkytown dance, she wears a blue turtleneck with a corset dress adorned with a pink hem.\n\n<br />\n\n==Theme park appearances==\nPatti was one of the characters of the stage show, ''Doug Live!'' which ran in [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] from 1999 to 2001.\n\nPatti also appeared as a walkaround character in Disney's Hollywood Studios in 1999. She was retired in mid-2001, though she may appear on rare occasions, such as when another cast member is delayed.\n\n==Trivia==\n*[[Guy Graham]] also had feelings for her, and as a result, became Doug's rival, which Guy was unaware of.\n*She speaks with a vague Southern accent.\n*She was based on two girls that the creator, Jim Jimkins, had a crush on in his childhood. One was named Patti, and the other was named Mayo.\n*She retains her design from the original series in \"Doug's Last Birthday\" before switching to her new design at the end.\n* Her haircut was one of the many things criticized by fans of show.\n* She and Doug are the only One Saturday Morning characters to appear in a Disney theme park and the only non-Disney characters to do so.\n*In one episode, it is revealed that Patti likes her burgers rare. The FDA strongly recommends cooking meat to at least medium to avoid foodborne illness.\u00a0\n*In an interview with Jim Jinkins, he said if he was to make another Doug series, Doug and Patti's relationship wouldn't last and someone else would become Doug's love interest, mainly because he believes it wouldn't be realistic to end up with your first love.\u00a0\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==References==\n<references />{{DEFAULTSORT:Mayonnaise, Patti}}\n\n{{Doug}}\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Doug characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Superheroes]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Cheerleaders]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Politicians]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
