The big, friendly leopard.\"|Badili introducing himself}}\n'''Badili''' is a leopard who appears in the ''[[The Lion Guard]]'' episode, \"[[The Trouble With Galagos]]\".\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nBaili is a nice and friendly leopard, but he is also very cowardly and doesn't have the confidence to stand up for himself. The Lion Guard teaches him to be brave and not to let others push him around.\n\n=== Appearance ===\nBadili is a pale cream-colored leopard dappled with brown rosettes outlined in black. He has a small tuft of brown hair on his head. His ears are pointed, with dusty brown inner ears rimmed in darker brown. He has thick, dark eyebrows and almond-shaped brown eyes. His nose is dull taupe-brown, and his claws are dark gray.\n\n===Abilities===\n*'''Skilled Combatant:''' After being trained by the [[Lion Guard]]; it can be assumed that Badili has become a capable combatant.\n*'''Animal Strength:''' Like all leopards, Badili is very strong. [[Beshte]] helped him build up his strength.\n*'''Animal Speed:''' Badili has enough speed to almost keep up with [[Fuli]]. She helped him build up his speed.\n*'''Animal Agility:''' Like all leopards; Badili is very agile.\n*'''Animal Leaping:''' Like all leopards; Badili can jump the highest of all big cats.\n*'''Animal Stamina:''' Like all leopards; Badili's stamina is very high.\n*'''Climber:''' Like all leopards; Badili has very good climbing skills.\n\n==Role in the Series==\n===''[[The Trouble With Galagos]]''===\nThe galagos tell the Lion Guard that a leopard has moved into their tree and they head to the galagos' tree, where Badili first appears sleeping in the branches. When the Lion Guard confront Badili, he tries to growl at them, But his courage instantly fails him and he cowers begging the team not to hurt him. He says he thought they were baboons because he dreamed about them chasing him. Ono asks him if he's the big, scary leopard, but Badili says no and introduces himself saying a he's big friendly leopard.\n\nWhen urged by the Lion Guard to return to his home in Mirihi Forest, Badili reluctantly does but is confronted and intimidated by a larger leopard named [[Mapigano]], who had driven Badili out of Mirihi Forest. Angered by Mapigano's attitude, The Lion Guard come to Badili's aid and force Mapigano to leave.\n\nThe next day, the Lion Guard find Badili back in the [[Pride Lands]] and learn that Mapigano has driven him out again. Kion realizes that it must be Badili himself who must get rid of Mapigano for good. The Lion Guard train Badili in how to be brave and confident.\n\nWhen deemed ready, Badili returns to Mirihi Forest and confronts Mapigano, who at first laughs at Badili's attempts of bravery and attacks him. Badili eventually plucks up courage and roars at Mapigano, causing the latter to flee Mirihi Forest for good. The Lion Guard congratulate Badili on his victory to which he thanks them for their help.\n\n== Relationships ==\n\n=== Friends ===\n====[[Kion]]====\n\nKion was the one who agreed to teach Badili how to be fierce so he could defeat Mapigano and even defended the leopard from him at first. When Badili's training was complete, Kion knows he can defeat Mapigano and when he does, he congratulated the leopard and said that all he had to do was be himself which is what he proudly did and the two remain close as of now.\n\n====[[Bunga]]====\n\nBunga was the one who taught Badili to be brave and even defended him from Mapigano at first when he couldn\u2019t.\n\nLater after his training is completed and he defeats the bully, Bunga and the others are extremely proud of Badili and the two as of now are on good terms.\n\n====[[Fuli]]====\n\nFuli was the one who helped Badili learn to be fast and even defended him Mapigano when he couldn\u2019t.\n\nOnce he completes his training, Badili is able to defeat his bully and Fuli \u00a0is quite happy when he does. The two remain on good terms as of now.\n\n====[[Beshte]]====\n\nBeshte was the one who helped Badili get stronger and defended him from Mapigano when he couldn\u2019t and, once he completes his training, he is able to stop his bully which makes Beshte proud of him.\n\nThe two remain on good terms as of now.\n\n====[[Ono]]====\n\nOno was the one who helped Badili with eye contact and even defended him from Mapigano when he couldn\u2019t and once he completes it, he isn\u2019t able to defeat his bully. At first Badili is worried that the Guard may have seen how scared he was, but Ono states that he saw a leopard standing up for himself, which delights Badili and the two remain on good terms for now.\n\n====[[Laini]]====\n\nLaini was scared of Badili at first. He wanted to sleep her tree and live with her group. Laini didn't like that idea and wanted him gone. The guard helped Badili go back home and he gave them their tree back. The two seem to be on good terms after that.\n\n=== Enemies ===\n====[[Mapigano]]====\n\nMapigano bullies Badili constantly, believing him to be a\u00a0''scaredy cat''. When Mapigano takes over his home, he refuses to compromise by sharing it, knowing that Badili is not powerful or strong enough to fight back.\n\nMapigano uses harsh words to force the other leopard into submission, but thanks to the Lion Guard. Badili finally plucks up the courage to fight back Mapigano who backs down and runs off.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nThe Trouble With Galagos 04.png\nThe Trouble With Galagos 13.png\nThe Trouble With Galagos 14.png\nThe Trouble With Galagos 18.png\nThe Trouble With Galagos 25.png|Badili roars at Mapigano\nThe Trouble With Galagos 26.png|Mapigano bullies Badili for returning to his territory\nThe Trouble With Galagos 27.png\nThe Trouble With Galagos 38.png\nThe Trouble With Galagos 56.png\nThe-trouble-with-galagos (110).png\nThe-trouble-with-galagos (113).png|Slumbering Badili\nThe-trouble-with-galagos (117).png\nThe-trouble-with-galagos (124).png\nThe-trouble-with-galagos (129).png\nThe-trouble-with-galagos (132).png|Badili is confronted by the Lion Guard for stealing the galagos' tree\nThe-trouble-with-galagos (135).png\nThe-trouble-with-galagos (136).png|\"Hi there!\"\nThe-trouble-with-galagos (147).png\nThe-trouble-with-galagos (153).png\nThe-trouble-with-galagos (207).png|Frightened of Mapigano\nThe-trouble-with-galagos (268).png|Kion assures Badili\nThe-trouble-with-galagos (274).png\nThe-trouble-with-galagos (322).png|Badili expresses his concerns\nThe Lion Guard The Trouble with Galagos WatchTLG snapshot 0.15.45.651 1080p.png\nThe Lion Guard The Trouble with Galagos WatchTLG snapshot 0.17.24.705 1080p.png\nThe Lion Guard The Trouble with Galagos WatchTLG snapshot 0.17.29.249 1080p.png\nThe-trouble-with-galagos (384).png\nThe Lion Guard The Trouble with Galagos WatchTLG snapshot 0.17.35.896 1080p.png\nThe-trouble-with-galagos (389).png|Fuli trains Badili to run swiftly during the musical number \"Find Your Roar\"\nThe-trouble-with-galagos (395).png|Badili finds his roar\nThe Lion Guard The Trouble with Galagos WatchTLG snapshot 0.17.54.252 1080p.png|\"I can't wait!\"\nThe-trouble-with-galagos (408).png\nThe Lion Guard The Trouble with Galagos WatchTLG snapshot 0.18.56.958 1080p.png|\"I happened!\"\nThe-trouble-with-galagos (433).png|Badili breaks\nThe-trouble-with-galagos (454).png\nThe-trouble-with-galagos (486).png\nThe-trouble-with-galagos (490).png\nThe Lion Guard The Trouble with Galagos WatchTLG snapshot 0.21.01.712 1080p.png|\"I couldn't have done it without you.
