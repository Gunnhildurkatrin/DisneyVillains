(short for '''Darn Cat''') is the titular character of ''[[That Darn Cat! (1965)|That Darn Cat!]]'' and its [[1997]] [[That Darn Cat (1997)|remake]].\n\nHe is depicted as a Siamese cat in the original [[1965]] film, but the 1997 remake portrays him as some sort of mixed-breed cat.\n\n==Role in the film==\nD.C. likes to cause trouble and goes out at 9 pm and drives people crazy. One night on the same day when the bank got robbed and the bank teller, Margaret Miller, was kidnapped by the robbers, [[Dan and Iggy]], D.C. found fish being bought by Iggy and followed him to the apartment where he, Dan, and Miller are hiding.\n\nMiller scratched on the back of her watch \"HELP\" but got interrupted by Iggy on the L, replaced D.C.'s collar with her watch, and let D.C. get out. Then, D.C. went back home. When D.C. got home, [[Patti Randall]] found the watch around D.C.'s neck. Because of the watch and remembering the Miller incident, she went to FBI agent [[Zeke Kelso]] and believes D.C. will lead the FBI to the kidnappers.\n\nAfter two crazy and funny nights of following D.C., they finally got to the kidnappers and arrested them and D.C. was made the hero.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The cat that played D.C. in the remake was known as Elvis and had previously starred in the [[1994]] [[Sylvester Stallone]] film ''The Specialist''.\n\n==Gallery==\n===That Darn Cat (1965)===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nD.C. with Petti.jpg\nThat-darn-cat-disneyscreencaps.com-15.jpg\nThat-darn-cat-disneyscreencaps.com-77.jpg\nThat-darn-cat-disneyscreencaps.com-233.jpg\nThat-darn-cat-disneyscreencaps.com-312.jpg\nthat-darn-cat-disneyscreencaps.com-1195.jpg\nthat-darn-cat-disneyscreencaps.com-2034.jpg\nthat-darn-cat-disneyscreencaps.com-2337.jpg\nthat-darn-cat-disneyscreencaps.com-2537.jpg\nThat-darn-cat-disneyscreencaps.com-3064.jpg\nThat-darn-cat-disneyscreencaps.com-4800.jpg\nThat-darn-cat-disneyscreencaps.com-4816.jpg\nThat-darn-cat-disneyscreencaps.com-4872.jpg\nThat-darn-cat-disneyscreencaps.com-4930.jpg\nThat-darn-cat-disneyscreencaps.com-5018.jpg\nThat-darn-cat-disneyscreencaps.com-5137.jpg\nThat-darn-cat-disneyscreencaps.com-8336.jpg\nThat-darn-cat-disneyscreencaps.com-9045.jpg\nthat-darn-cat-disneyscreencaps.com-9331.jpg\nthat-darn-cat-disneyscreencaps.com-12575.jpg\nThat-darn-cat-disneyscreencaps.com-12818.jpg\nThat-darn-cat-disneyscreencaps.com-13071.jpg\nThat-darn-cat-disneyscreencaps.com-13134.jpg\nThat-darn-cat-disneyscreencaps.com-13155.jpg\nThat-darn-cat-disneyscreencaps.com-13176.jpg\nThat-darn-cat-disneyscreencaps.com-13207.jpg\nThat-darn-cat-disneyscreencaps.com-13685.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===That Darn Cat (1997)===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nD.C. 1997.jpg|D.C. as he appeared in the 1997 remake\nthat-darn-cat-7.jpg\nThatdarncat9714.jpg\nThatdarncat9713.jpg\nThatdarncat9712.jpg\nThatdarncat9711.jpg\nThatdarncat9710.jpg\nThatdarncat9709.jpg\nThatdarncat9708.jpg\nThatdarncat9707.jpg\nThatdarncat9706.jpg\nThatdarncat9704.jpg\nThatdarncat9703.jpg\nThatdarncat9702.jpg\nThatdarncat9701.jpg\n</gallery>\u00a0\n\n{{That Darn Cat!}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:That Darn Cat! characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Pets]]"
