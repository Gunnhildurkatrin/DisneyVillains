Their members consist of dragons from several corners of the globe and they administer orders and judgment all other dragons in the Order, they have the authority to remove the dragon power from a member of the order as well as reinstate it. Every year they hold a Summit for all dragons on their home, the Isle of Draco, and every 1,000 years they hold a toast for all the dragons at a temple in Hong Kong. Because there are so many threats to the Magical world, the Dragon Council have actually ranked the worst as the 13 Most Dangerous Threats to the Magical World. The Council consists of\u00a0five members (four after Chang's betrayal).\n\n==Members==\n*[[Councilor Andam]] - The Dragon of Africa and the apparent leader of the Council (he was the one who made the thousand year toast).\n*[[Councilor Kulde]] - The Dragon of Norway.\n*[[Councilor Chang]] (formerly) - The Dragon of China, betrayed the council to serve [[the Dark Dragon]].\n*[[Councilor Kukulkhan]] - The Dragon of Central America. He was only heard once (and even that's debatable) and was only seen his dragon form once.\n*[[Councilor Omina]] - The Dragon of Atlantis. She is never heard talking and only transformed once in the series.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nAndam_old.gif|Councilor Andam\nAndam_old1.gif|Andam in Dragon Form\nAndam.jpg|Councilor Andam in Season 2\nAndam1.jpg|Andam in Dragon Form (Season 2)\nKulde_old.gif|Councilor Kulde\nKulde.jpg|Councilor Kulde (Season 2)\nKulde_old1.gif|Kulde in Dragon form\nKulde1.jpg|Kulde in Dragon Form (Season 2)\nKukulkan_old.gif|Councilor Kukulkan\nScreenshot-3.png|Kukulkan in his apparent Dragon form\nOmina_old.gif|Councilor Omina\nOmina.jpg|Councilor Omina (Season 2)\nOmina1.jpg|Omina in Dragon Form\nChang_old.gif|Councilor Chang\nchang_old1.gif|Chang's Dragon form\nDragon Summit (53).jpg\nDragon Summit (61).jpg\nDragon Summit (70).jpg\nThe Halloween Bash (64).jpg\nThe Halloween Bash (65).jpg\nThe Halloween Bash (66).jpg\nThe Halloween Bash (67).jpg\nThe Halloween Bash (68).jpg\nThe Hong Kong Longs (7).jpg\nThe Hong Kong Longs (6).jpg\nThe Hong Kong Longs (11).jpg\nThe Hong Kong Longs (5).jpg\nThe Hong Kong Longs (4).jpg\nThe Hong Kong Longs (13).jpg\nThe Hong Kong Longs (15).jpg\nThe Hong Kong Longs (16).jpg\nThe Hong Kong Longs (17).jpg\nThe Hong Kong Longs (19).jpg\nThe Hong Kong Longs (21).jpg\nThe Hong Kong Longs (22).jpg\nDragon Summit (87).jpg\nDragon Summit (91).jpg\nDragon Summit (94).jpg\nDragon Summit (96).jpg\nDragon Summit (97).jpg\nDragon Summit (99).jpg\nDragon Summit (100).jpg\nDragon Summit (102).jpg\nDragon Summit (103).jpg\nDragon Summit (104).jpg\nDragon Summit (110).jpg\nDragon Summit (112).jpg\nThe Halloween Bash (82).jpg\nThe Halloween Bash (85).jpg\nDragon Council walks and talking about Master Jake Under Control.jpg\nDragon Council real mad at Jake Throwing a Party.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{American Dragon: Jake Long}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dragon Council, The}}\n[[Category:American Dragon: Jake Long characters]]\n[[Category:Dragons]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Councils]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
