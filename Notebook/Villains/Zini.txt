Any of you ladies up for a game of 'Monkey in the Middle'?|Zini|Dinosaur}}\n\n'''Zini''' is a lemur and a supporting character from Disney's [[2000]] CGI film ''[[Dinosaur]]''.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nZini likes making wisecracks and is noticeably into girl lemurs, he is [[Yar]]'s son, [[Suri]]'s uncle, and [[Plio]]'s brother, as well as [[Aladar]]'s best friend, when he fails to attract any females during the mating ritual, he becomes a bit disappointed. However, by the end of the film, he finds a number of girl lemurs on the [[Nesting Grounds]] who are all attracted to him, much to his joy and delight.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Dinosaur]]''===\nZini is first seen in the movie as a kid lemur when a dinosaur egg falls on [[Lemur Island]], where he lives with his father [[Yar]]\u00a0and his older sister [[Plio]]. As the other lemurs gather around the fallen egg, Zini tries to get closer, but Yar stops him, telling him it's not safe. After the egg cracks, Zini's sister Plio opens the shell and\u00a0is happy to see\u00a0a baby [[Iguanodon]]. She holds the baby in her hands and decides that she will raise him. Yar objects because he says that one day he will eat them, but he eventually accepts the baby after it urinates on him, and Plio reaffirms him that the baby will learn not to eat meat; she names the baby [[Aladar]]. Yar reluctantly lets her keep the hatchling, but warns her that he may bite. Zini goes over to the baby Iguanodon and checks its mouth before saying: \"This monster's got no teeth. What's he gonna do, gum us to death?\"\n\nYears later, Aladar has grown up a vegetarian dinosaur, thanks to Plio's care. Later, Aladar watches Zini, now a young adult lemur, as he practices lines for picking up girl lemurs. During the mating ritual, all the male lemurs are given a pep talk by Yar before they swing from their vines, and each attempts to get a female lemur. Every lemur ends up finding a mate except Zini, who snags his feet on a vine before he could even swing forward. By the time he unsticks himself, all the female lemurs have left, much to his disappointment. Aladar tries to comfort Zini, who seems to take it okay and believes he will get another chance at finding girls.\n\nShortly\u00a0after the ritual, Plio is present when a fireball falls from the sky, causing violent tremors. Other fireballs soon start falling, destroying the island. Plio urges Aladar to run and he takes\u00a0her, Yar, [[Suri]] and Zini\u00a0on his back, and they escape the island by jumping across the sea to the mainland. Zini and the others are devastated that everyone on the island was killed by the fireballs, and that he and his family are the last ones of their kind.\n\nFor the next few days, they wander through deserted lands until they find a dinosaur herd led by [[Kron]]. Zini is the first one to make a wisecrack to the high-and-mighty Iguanodon. Kron glares at Zini and his family and warns them to stay out of his way before heading on with his second-in-command [[Bruton]] and his sister [[Neera]]. Zini and the others learn that the herd is going to the [[Nesting Grounds]]. There, they befriend some of the elder dinosaurs: [[Baylene]], [[Eema]] and [[Url]] who are at the end of the herd because they are too old to follow the rhythm of the others.\n\nAfter several days of rough marching, Bruton (who had been attacked by [[Carnotaurus|Carnotaurs]]) informs Kron that Carnotaurs are following them so Kron decides to accelerate the pace, not caring if someone is left behind. Because of this, Aladar, the lemurs, Baylene, Eema and Url separate from the herd. On a rainy night, they find shelter in a cave. They also find a wounded Bruton who has been banished from the herd by Kron. Despite the obvious, Aladar helps a reluctant Bruton into the cave. While Plio tends to Bruton's wounds, he asks her why she is giving them false hopes, but Plio reassures him that hope is the last thing that gets lost and that he is welcome to follow them. That night when two Carnotaurs attack them, everyone manages to escape deeper in the cave, but Bruton dies in the process while saving them, and the entrance of the cave is blocked by the falling rocks.\n\nLater, after wandering for hours in the cave, Suri and Zini start smelling something. Plio and Yar smell the same thing, and so they start digging\u00a0through the rocks to discover a ray of light; however, more rocks fall and cover the exit. Aladar screams in frustration and gives up, but Baylene says that they didn't come this far only to give up, and so everyone starts to push the rocks until they discover something amazing: they have arrived at the Nesting Grounds. Plio is happy that they have finally arrived at their new home, and she with Yar watch happily as Suri, Zini and Baylene jump into the lake. Aladar then goes to warn the rest of the herd about the cave entrance.\n\nMonths later, Aladar and Neera have babies of their own, and Zini is seen surrounded by many girl lemurs who all want to date him, much to his delight.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\">\nImageyoungzini.jpg|Young Zini\nImagezy.jpg|Young Zini with his father Yar\nDinosaur-disneyscreencaps.com-751.jpg\nChar 14971.jpg|Adult Zini\ntumblr_loz7uc9U1w1qlxcxco1_500.jpg\nDinosaur-disneyscreencaps.com-2666.jpg\ndinosaur-disneyscreencaps.com-6921.jpg\nZini with girl lemurs.jpg|Zini with girl lemurs\nGame Zini.JPG|Zini in ''[[Disney's Dinosaur (video game)|Disney's Dinosaur]]'' game\nJune8th.png|Zini's ''[[Disneystrology]]'' page\n</gallery>\n\n{{Dinosaur}}\n[[pt-br:Zini]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Dinosaur characters]]\n[[Category:Lemurs]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Uncles]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric animals]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric characters]]\n\n== Trivia ==\n\n*Zini is [[w:c:madagascar:Maurice|one]] [[w:c:madagascar:Mort|of]] [[w:c:madagascar:King_Julien|lemurs]].\n*Aladar and Zini\u2019s relationship is very similar to Samson and Benny from The Wild, which these two were best friends, along with Alex and Marty from DreamWorks\u2019s Madagascar."
