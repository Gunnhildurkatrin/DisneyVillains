Bongo instantly falls in love with her, thinking that it's too good to be true, but their interlude is cut short by the appearance of [[Lumpjaw]], who wants Lulubelle to himself. Lulubelle tries to assert the fact that she loves Bongo by slapping his cheeks, but Bongo mistakenly regards it as her dumping him and walks away brokenhearted with Lumpjaw having Lulubelle to himself. But when Bongo sees a couple of other bears showing their love by slapping each other, he realizes that Lulubelle really loved him after all and rushes back to save her from Lumpjaw. Near the end of the battle, after Bongo and Lumpjaw fell in the waterfall, Lulubelle cries, thinking that Bongo is dead, but he managed to survive. Bongo slaps Lulubelle for his love towards him and Lulubelle the same. The film ends on Bongo and Lulubelle climbing up a pair of trees that bend into the shape of a heart.\n\n===[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]===\nLulubelle was a fairly common character at the Disney Parks, usually appearing alongside Bongo. Both she and Bongo have been retired since the early [[1990|'90s]].\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the ''Bongo'' comics, Lulubelle is absent for undisclosed reasons, showing only [[Bongo the Bear|Bongo]], [[Lumpjaw]], and various forest animals thereof.\n*In the 1948 Golden Book based on the segment, Lulubelle is explicitly described as only a friend to Bongo, resulting that Golden Books wanted to reduce the romantic themes for the younger readers.\n*Lulebelle's original names were \"Suzie\" and \"Silverear\"\n\n==Gallery ==\n{{Gallerylink|Lulubelle/Gallery}}\n{{Fun and Fancy Free}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Bears]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Fun and Fancy Free characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]"
