As the sworn protector of [[Artemis Fowl II]], he has a younger niece\u00a0named Juliet Butler and aids Artemis in his plan to rescue his father.\n\n==Personality==\nThis gigantic man is akin to a one-person army. Although skilled with weapons, his mastery of martial arts often makes it unnecessary. He comes from a long line of Butler family members who have protected the Fowls over the years and his only goal is to keep young Artemis safe. He accepts being referred to as either \"Domovoi,\" or \"Dom,\" but absolutely will not allow anyone to call him \"The Butler.\"\n\n{{Artemis Fowl}}\n[[Category:Artemis Fowl characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Servants]]\n[[Category:Martial Artists]]\n[[Category:Uncles]]"
