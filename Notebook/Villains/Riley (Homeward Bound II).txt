He is first seen arriving with his gang and saves [[Shadow]], [[Sassy]], and [[Chance]] from [[Ashcan and Pete]], two vicious junkyard dogs. He then tells Shadow and Sassy (Chance fled, thinking that Riley's gang were reinforcements for Ashcan and Pete by Sassy) that it is unsafe to be around here because there are humans present, and humans are bad news.\n\nRiley reveals that he hates all humans, as well as pets who associate with humans. The reason why (according to what Delilah told\u00a0Chance at some point)\u00a0is\u00a0that a long time ago, when Riley was just\u00a0a puppy, he was a Christmas present for a boy. However, the boy refused to like him\u00a0and play with him, so the parents got rid of him by leaving him in a gutter on that Christmas night in the rain.\u00a0\n\nRiley later starts to change his mind about humans after Shadow rescues a boy named Tucker from a burning house. When he asks Shadow if a human would risk their lives to save him, he tells Riley that his owner [[Peter Seaver|Peter]] would. He then agrees to escort Shadow and Sassy home. However, Riley is displeased when he sees Chance hanging with Delilah\u00a0(they had sparked a romance together while he and his gang had left). Indignant, he tries to convince Delilah that she shouldn't be with Chance because he is a housepet. She refuses to listen to Riley at first, but when Chance's unruly antics get him and Riley's gang in trouble, Delilah reluctantly dumps him, causing poor Chance to storm off heartbroken and angry at everyone for what everyone caused, and told them off for it.\n\nRiley and his gang attempt to find Chance, but to no avail. Riley is last seen leading Shadow and Sassy to the bridge, where he and the two housepets prepare to go their separate ways. Before they do, Riley tells Shadow that he'll keep in mind about what the latter\u00a0said about humans, to which Shadow replies, \"Riley, you're all right.\" Presumably, he also allowed Delilah to quit his gang to be with Chance.\n\n==Trivia==\n*He is rather similar\u00a0to [[Buster (Lady and the Tramp)|Buster]]\u00a0and [[Shere Khan]]\u00a0in that Buster hates pets who associate with humans, and Khan just hates humans in general, so they have always\u00a0had a hatred for humans, also known as {{WikipediaLink|Misanthropy|misanthropy}}, except that Riley is not a villain.\n**He also shares a\u00a0similarity to [[King Triton]]\u00a0in this way, except that Riley possesses a softer disposition of humans after his meeting with Shadow.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\">\n0riley.jpg\nImagesCAF138PR.jpg|Riley (left) with Shadow (right) in ''Homeward Bound II: Lost in San Francisco''\n</gallery>\n\n{{Homeward Bound}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Homeward Bound characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]"
