After [[Donny McStuffins|Donny]]'s bath in the bathtub, the bath toys get away from Mr. Chomp because they are frightened of him. [[Doc McStuffins (character)|Doc]] thinks it might be one of\u00a0his\u00a0teeth that is\u00a0broken and begins to take a look at it, but [[Lambie]] climbs up her face, blocking her view, because she is frightened too. Doc takes Mr. Chomp to her room for a check-up. The toys are frightened of him too at first, but then help Doc out. When Doc reassures her friends that Mr. Chomp is friendly, he cries. Doc realizes he is brokenhearted because everyone thinks he is mean. After a solo song, Lambie and the toys apologize to Mr. Chomp for being scared of him. Lambie and [[Stuffy]] tell him a joke and sit next to him while Doc fixes his tooth. Feeling better, Mr. Chomp even sleeps with Doc and the other toys.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nMr._Chomp.png\nMr.Chomp the shark.jpg|Mr.Chomp as he appears in the Doc files.\nMr.Chomp's docfiles.png\nDonnyMr. ChompsBronty -Mr. Chomps Chompers.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chomp}}\n{{Doc McStuffins}}\n[[Category:Sharks]]\n[[Category:Toys]]\n[[Category:Doc McStuffins characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]"
