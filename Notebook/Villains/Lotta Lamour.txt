She appears in the ''[[TaleSpin]]'' episode \"[[The Road to Macadamia]]\".\n\nShe is known in the kingdom for her intelligence, beauty, and power, but her monarch rabbit father King Amok is, unfortunately, seemingly dim-witted.\n\nLotta becomes not only the target for [[Baloo#TaleSpin|Baloo]] and [[King Louie#TaleSpin|Louie]]'s affections during a cargo pick-up to the country, but also of the power-hungry buzzard [[Chancellor Trample]] who wants to marry her in order to run the kingdom after staging a palace coup d'etat by withholding back the tax money of the national treasury to create a public uprising.\n\nFortunately, Lottawis able to foil the Chancellor's plot with Louie and Baloo's help. Although she likes both of them, she doesn't fall for either one of them, but is grateful for their help in restoring her and her father's kingdom back to the justifiable rulers.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nLotta020.jpg\nLotta041.jpg\nLotta059.jpg\nLotta078.jpg\nLotta124.jpg\nLotta157.jpg\nLotta170.jpg\nLotta205.jpg\nLotta236.jpg\nLotta277.jpg\nLotta293.jpg\nLotta295.jpg\nLotta298.jpg\nLotta307.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{TaleSpin}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lamour, Lotta}}\n[[Category:TaleSpin characters]]\n[[Category:Foxes]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Princesses]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Middle Eastern characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
