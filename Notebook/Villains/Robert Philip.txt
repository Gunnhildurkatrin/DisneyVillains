He is a divorce attorney who doesn't believe in fairytales or love after his ex-wife left him and his daughter, [[Morgan Philip|Morgan]].\n\n==Personality==\nRobert Philip is a no-nonsense, forthright, and sometimes pessimistic divorce lawyer whose occupation and the divorce of his first wife has led him to adopt a rather melancholy outlook on life. Robert can sometimes be aloof toward the emotional output of other people and any departure from logic and sensible thinking. In general, he is [[Giselle]]'s opposite, choosing not to sing or dance or indulge her fantastical stories of [[Andalasia]]. Therefore, when he first meets Giselle he wastes no time in finding out where she is from and sending her on her way.\n\nNevertheless, he is not incapable of showing his love and loosening up. He is a well-meaning and providing father, hoping to bring his daughter [[Morgan Philip|Morgan]] up with a loving mother and a sensible take on life. He also doesn't encourage \"fairy-tale nonsense\" wanting Morgan to be able to face the world for what it is, much like [[George Darling]] in ''[[Peter Pan (film)|Peter Pan]]'' and [[George Banks]] in ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]''. Despite Morgan's apprehension, he does his best to encourage a bond between her and his fianc\u00e9e [[Nancy Tremaine|Nancy]], but Morgan is drawn to Giselle's warmth and kindness.\n\nWhile Robert teaches Giselle that no relationship is ever perfect, she teaches him not to take the one he loves for granted and that he must show her that he loves her. By exchanging their ideals honestly, Giselle starts to bring him out of his shell after they spend a day in the park and have a meal that night. Robert is sad to see her go when [[Prince Edward|Edward]] comes for her and encourages her to find him if she ever visits New York again.\n\nAt this time, his feelings for Giselle have changed him. As they dance together at the King and Queen's ball he softly sings \"[[So Close]]\" to her and is later willing to step in front of Giselle to keep [[Queen Narissa|Narissa]] from hurting her. Robert experiences a wave of emotion as he finally reconciles with Giselle and they share their feelings. By the end, he is dancing happily and carelessly with Giselle and Morgan.\n\n== Trivia ==\n*Robert is Patrick Dempsey's second role in a Disney film, his first was [[Kenai]] in ''[[Brother Bear 2]]'' replacing [[Joaquin Phoenix]].\n*Robert's last name is a tribute to [[Prince Phillip]] from ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'', whose kiss awakened [[Aurora]].\n*The way he runs his family is akin to [[George Darling]] and [[George Banks]]. All three try to make their children grow up without fairy tales and make-believe in attempts to prepare them for the real world.\n*Robert wears a similar suit to [[Beast]]'s during the ball scene.\n*Robert is the only major character in the film who doesn't have an animated counterpart.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nTumblr ndxf7vs1zD1qiceiuo1 1280.jpg\nGiselleshower.jpg\nGiselledance.jpg\nGiselleumbrella.jpg\nEnchanted Robert and Giselle Dancing.jpg\nGiselle-Robert-giselle-robert-10761506-400-248.jpg\nGiselle-Robert-giselle-robert-10761510-400-248.jpg\nEdward 62.PNG\nEdward 73.PNG\nEdward 88.PNG\nEnchanted-giselle-robert-13343844-720-480.jpg\nEnchanted-doll-set.jpg\nEnchanted_Robert_Doll.jpg\nEnchanted Poster 01.jpg\nEnchanted Poster 04.jpg\nEnchanted-poster.jpg\nenchanted 1 picture.jpg\nenchanted 5 picture.jpg\nenchanted 14 picture.jpg\nenchanted 7 picture.jpg\nRobert 1.jpg\nRobert 2.jpg\nRobert 3.jpg\nRobert 4.jpg\nRobert 5.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Enchanted}}\n[[pt-br:Robert Philip]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Enchanted characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Lawyers]]\n[[Category:Deuteragonists]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]"
