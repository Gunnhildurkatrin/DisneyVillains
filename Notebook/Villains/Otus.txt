From Aloeus they received their patronymic, the Aloadai. They were strong and aggressive giants, growing by nine fingers every month nine fathoms tall at age nine, and only outshone in beauty by Orion.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nOTUS DISNEY.gif\nOTUS DISNEY 2.gif\n</gallery>\n\n{{Hercules}}\n[[Category:Hercules characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Immortal]]\n[[Category:Olympian Gods]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Demigods and Demigoddesses]]"
