Before she died by burning completely at the stake by Blackbeard, who found out she was actually a witch, she put a curse on him that he will always be on Earth in limbo unless there'll be a spark of human goodness in him. Her tale was also told by [[Emily Stowecroft]] to [[Steve Walker]]\u00a0when he came to spend the night at [[Blackbeard's Inn]]. She had a bed warmer which Steve purchased at an auction for $200 and when he accidentally sat on it, he found her book of spells in it along with a spell that can bring his eyes and ears to one who is bound in limbo: \"Kree, Kruh, Vergo, Gaba, Kalto, Kree\", thus, allowing him to see \"That's right\" Blackbeard's Ghost. Her portrait can be seen in Blackbeard's room of his Inn.\n\n==Trivia==\n* Since the early 2000s [[Madame Leota]]'s book of spells in the Seance Room in the American versions of the [[Haunted Mansion]] features, \"Kree, Kruh, Vergo, Gaba, Kalto, Kree\" on the pages dedicated to summoning spirits from limbo.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nEmily Stowecroft.jpg|Emily Stowecroft telling Aldetha's tale to Steve Walker\n06_BARBANEGRA_ANTE_ALDETHA.jpg|Blackbeard next to Aldetha's portrait\n</gallery>\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Teach, Aldetha}}\n{{Blackbeard's Ghost}}\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Witches]]\n[[Category:Blackbeard's Ghost characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
