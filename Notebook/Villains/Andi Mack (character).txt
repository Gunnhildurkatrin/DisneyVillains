She is portrayed by\u00a0[[Peyton Elizabeth Lee]].\n\n\n\nA girl who is about to realize that she can define who she is, when her older sister [[Bex Mack|Bex]] returns home with a revelation, Andi is left with many questions that jump start her self-discovery. She has her sounding boards and best friends [[Cyrus (Andi Mack)|Cyrus]] and [[Buffy]] by her side, and each are simultaneously attempting to understand who they are and how they might fit in the world.\n\nAndi was raised in a loving yet overprotective home. Now, with Bex\u2019s encouragement, she begins to step outside her comfort zone, particularly when it comes to approaching the most intriguing guy at Jefferson Middle School\u2014[[Jonah Beck]], whom she quickly realizes is dating a high school girl, Amber. Andi proves that her greatest strengths may be how she accepts life\u2019s unpredictability with optimism.\u00a0She also finds solace by tapping into her creativity in her backyard hideaway, the Andi Shack.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nAndiS1.jpg\nAndi Mack - Friends.jpg\nAndi Mack - Cast.jpg\nmillicent-simmonds-andi-mack-recurring.jpg|Libby and andi from season 3\nAndi's emoji.PNG\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Andi was born on September 28th, 2003.\n\n{{Andi Mack}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mack (character), Andi}}\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Chinese characters]]\n[[Category:Andi Mack characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Artists]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
