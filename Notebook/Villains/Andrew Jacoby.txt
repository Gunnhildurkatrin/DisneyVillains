Andrew was chosen to be Princess Mia's husband from a list of suitors in order to marry and being able to inherit the throne of Genova, they met in the beach where they got along and later played badminton where Andrew tended to Mia after she tripped. Days later they went to the Royal Garden where Andrew proposed to Mia with his great-grandmother's engagement ring. He then told Mia that his great-grandparents were married by many years and hoped they could be able to do so. However, it is later revealed that Andrew reciprocates Mia's lack of romantic interest in him, and admits he's only marrying her due to a sense of duty. Luckily, Mia ends up calling off the wedding and becomes queen by changing the laws, which Andrew agrees with. They simply remain friends afterwards. \n\n{{Stub}}\n{{The Princess Diaries}}\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:The Princess Diaries characters]]\n[[Category:European characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Horsemen]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Military characters]]"
