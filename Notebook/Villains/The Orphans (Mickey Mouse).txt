"[[File:Mmilc13.jpg|thumb|250px]]\nThe '''Orphans''' are an unruly group of children (always looking like a younger [[Mickey Mouse]]) for whom the gang are always trying to help out in the form of shows, picnics, etc. The gang's philanthropy, however, is usually not returned in the same spirit.\u00a0[[Morty and Ferdie Fieldmouse]]\u00a0were created at the same time as the Orphans and were, in their first appearances, virtualy indistinguishable from them.\n\n== Physical Appearance ==\nThe Orphans share a strong resemblance to Mickey during his youth, except that they each wear a sailor hat and pajama gown (the color of the gown is usually a shade of blue). However, there is no way of distinguishing the Orphans from one another as they are identical. \n\n== Personality ==\nThe Orphans are mischievous, always causing trouble for Donald Duck by stealing food from him as well as feeding him a bee-stuffed sandwich. However, they are not without a playful side as the Orphans will play a game with Mickey.\n\n==Filmography==\n*''[[Giantland]]''\n*''[[Gulliver Mickey]]''\n*''[[Orphan's Benefit (1934)|Orphan's Benefit]]''\n*''[[Orphans' Picnic]]''\n*''[[Mickey's Circus]]''\n*''[[Orphan's Benefit (1941)|Orphan's Benefit]]'' (color remake of the 1934 version)\n*''[[Pluto's Party]]''\n*''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' (cameo)\n*''[[Miscellaneous Disney animated shorts compilation videos|The Spirit of Mickey]]'' (cameo)\n*''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]''\n**\"[[\u00a1Feliz Cumplea\u00f1os!]]\"\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\n19605.jpg|The Orphans in ''Giantland''.\n16707.jpg|Similar characters in the short ''[[Mickey's Nightmare]]''\u2014Mickey and Minnie's sons as depicted in his dream.\nTumblr m44tlp6R711r3jmn6o1 500.png\nGulliver mickey 3large.jpg|The Orphans in ''Gulliver Mickey''.\nGulliver mickey 8large.jpg\n21005.jpg|The Orphans in ''Orphan's Benefit''.\n21006.jpg\n21010.jpg\nORPHAN'SBENEFIT193461.jpg\nORPHAN'SBENEFIT193463.jpg\nORPHAN'SBENEFIT193464.jpg\nORPHAN'SBENEFIT193467.jpg\nORPHAN'SBENEFIT193473.jpg\nORPHAN'SBENEFIT193478.jpg\nORPHAN'SBENEFIT193479.jpg\nORPHAN'SBENEFIT193481.jpg\nORPHAN'SBENEFIT193482.jpg\nORPHAN'SBENEFIT193484.jpg\n23505.jpg|The Orphans in ''Orphan's Picnic''.\n1936-campagne-2.jpg\nTumblr n5bj0aJLOL1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\nORPHAN'S PICNIC.png\n23511.jpg\n23512.jpg\n1936-campagne-3.jpg\n1936-campagne-4.jpg\nTumblr n9dr6yrpT21qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\nMickeys circus 4large.jpg|The Orphans in ''Mickey's Circus''.\n32705.jpg|The Orphans in the remake of ''Orphan's Benefit''.\n32707.jpg\nCapture -85.png|The Orphans in ''Pluto's Party''.\n53508.jpg\n53511.jpg\n53513.jpg\nLasMa\u00f1anitas.png|The Orphans in \"\u00a1Feliz Cumplea\u00f1os!\" episode of ''Mickey Mouse''.\nMiguelito.png\nMickeyBDAY.jpg\nI-LLgSrx4-M.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Mickey Mouse & Friends}}\n{{Mickey Mouse (TV series)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Orphans, The}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Mice]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Orphans]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Who Framed Roger Rabbit cameos]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse (TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
