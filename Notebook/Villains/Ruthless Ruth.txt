She was the original owner of [[The Snuggly Duckling]] who had a barbaric reputation, but also has a secret talent for writing and singing songs.\n\n==Background==\nAccording to the [[Pub Thugs]], Ruthless Ruth was one of the meanest thugs who ever lived. The people of [[Corona]] lived in fear of her, and would go on terrible rampages through the streets of the kingdom. She owned a spiked Club which used to intimidate her customers and destroy anything in her path. The crosses carved in her club were believed to be the number of destruction she made. Little did everyone know that she secretly had a passion for writing and singing songs, and the crosses on her club were actually musical notes. However, she was afraid of sharing her music with others. Afraid that no one would want to hear her songs. Even in death, she suffered through doubt and fear until one day someone would sing her song and free her spirit to the afterlife.\n\nHer song, carved into her club, would not be heard until her slumber was disturbed by the [[Captain of the Guards]]. Only [[Rapunzel]] was able to figure out why Ruth's spirit came back to haunt the pub. With her help, Ruth was able to finally sing in front of others and encouraged them to sing along, allowing her spirit to be released into the afterlife.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\">\nThe Wrath of Ruthless Ruth 13.png|Meeting Rapunzel\nThe Wrath of Ruthless Ruth 74.png\nThe Wrath of Ruthless Ruth 75.png\nThe Wrath of Ruthless Ruth 82.png\nThe Wrath of Ruthless Ruth 94.png\nThe Wrath of Ruthless Ruth 92.png\nThe Wrath of Ruthless Ruth 93.png\n The-Wrath-of-Ruthless-Ruth-10.png\nThe Wrath of Ruthless Ruth 96.png\nThe Wrath of Ruthless Ruth 98.png\nThe-Wrath-of-Ruthless-Ruth-11.png\nThe Wrath of Ruthless Ruth 99.png\nListen Up.png\nThe Wrath of Ruthless Ruth 101.png\nThe Wrath of Ruthless Ruth 102.png\nThe Wrath of Ruthless Ruth 103.png\nThe Wrath of Ruthless Ruth 107.png\nThe Wrath of Ruthless Ruth - Rapunzel and Ruth.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Tangled}}\n[[Category:Spirits]]\n[[Category:Tangled characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
