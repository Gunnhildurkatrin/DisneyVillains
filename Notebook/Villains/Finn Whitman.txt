My name is Finn\"}}'''Lawrence Finnegan \"Finn\" Whitman '''is a 18-year-old from Orlando; main character of the [[Kingdom Keepers|Kingdom Keepers book series]] by Ridley Pearson. He is one of the five kids that modeled as DHIs (Disney Host Interactive or Daylight Hologram Imaging) to become holographic guides to the Disney Parks. He acts as the group leader of    \nthe Keepers. Their goal is to stop the Overtakers from controlling the parks.\n\n==Biography==\nFinn is the head of the Kingdom Keepers DHI team. He took the DHI job at his mother\u2019s urging \u2014 little did she know what path that would lead him down. Finn is probably the smartest of the Kingdom Keepers. With his quick wit, courage and grace under pressure he comes up with some pretty creative responses to danger. This is a guy that others depend on. His reliability and diplomacy in managing a wide array of personalities makes him the natural-born leader of the Kingdom Keepers along with his best friend and new keeper Connor Taylor.\n\nIn the first book, [[Kingdom Keepers I: Disney After Dark|Disney After Dark]], he and the other keepers save the parks from [[Maleficent]]. In [[Kingdom Keepers II: Disney at Dawn|Disney at Dawn]], he and the keepers are contacted by [[Wayne Kresky|Wayne]] after Maleficent escapes. Then he and the others must save [[Jessica Lockhart|Jez]], who has been kidnapped by the Overtakers, and to destroy a second DHI server that causes the kids to go into coma when asleep. On [[Kingdom Keepers III: Disney In Shadow|Disney In Shadow]], He leads the group to rescue Wayne, who has been kidnapped. In the end, Maleficent and the Overtaker boss, Chernabog are captured, basically leaving the Overtakers without a clue what to do.\n\nIn [[Kingdom Keepers IV: Power Play|Power Play]], Finn and the others encounter the replacement leaders for the Overtakers,\u00a0[[The Evil Queen]], and [[Cruella De Vil|Cruella]], who have recruited other kids into the Overtaker ranks in their plan to free Maleficent and Chernabog. Finn is put under a spell by the Queen to kiss Jess and put her into Sleeping Beauty Syndrome to ensure her visions of the future cannot help the Keepers. However, the Queen's plan fails as Finn's love for Amanda makes him kiss her instead. Freeing Amanda from the curse, Finn and the other are unable to stop the Overtakers from freeing their bosses.\n\nIn [[Kingdom Keepers V: Shell Game|Shell Game]], things have come to a head in the battle to defeat the Overtakers as they attack the Base, which houses the DHI servers. Also, rumors have been spreading that the Keepers might get replaced because Disney might want new interactive holograms. He is given the code \"Starfish wise, starfish cries\" to call upon King Triton's forces if ever in peril; he's use this twice, one to nearly drown Maleficent. His relationship with Amanda also becomes strained, but his love for her remains unwavering.\n\n==Trivia==\n* After getting that electric shock from shorting out the power on the ''Dream'', Finn no longer tolerates the idea of sparing the Overtakers' lives; he's strangled [[Tia Dalma]] so she'd release his mother from Overtaker control, used his hologram powers to rip a hole in Maleficent's chest, and trapped Chernabog in a flooding room\n*Finn wishing to kill the Overtakers is actually VERY logical. Given detaining them does nothing but backfire on them. Plus they aren't really living beings, but instead inanimate objects the Traveler breathed pseudo-life into.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFinn Whitman.jpg|Finn Whitman\nFinn 1.JPG|Finn on Disney After Dark\nFinn 2.JPG|Finn on Disney At Dawn\nFinn 3.JPG|Finn on Disney In Shadow\nFinn and amanda.png|Finn on Shell Game\nFinn Whitman.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Kingdom Keepers}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Whitman, Finn}}\n[[Category:Kingdom Keepers]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Keepers characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Time travelers]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
