However, this ended up, what she slipped in slug slime and separated her septum. After that, Fern decided to send Rosetta on the games in next year, who had stubbornly avoided them.\n\n===Personality===\nFern is a pragmatic and organized garden fairy, that is highly respected among garden fairies. This is evident, when she urges everyone to quickly choose a partner for Chloe and everyone, although reluctantly, agrees. Fern is also strict and unyielding, as this seen, when Rosetta tried to avoid participating in games, but she didn't give her, saying (\"It's your turn\").\n\nLike Rosetta, Fern was originally convinced that the garden fairies would not win, despite Chloe's optimism. Nevertheless, upon how Chloe was able to pass the first game called leapfrogging, she changed her mind and supported the Garden Team until the end.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"185\">\nPixie-Hollow-Games-Trading-Cards-Fern.jpeg\nPixie-Hollow-Games-Trading-Cards-Fern-back side.jpeg\nAjhcdkf.png|Fern's cameo in ''[[The Pirate Fairy]]''\nFern-01.webp\nFern-02.jpeg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Disney Fairies}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Fairies]]\n[[Category:Disney Fairies characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]"
