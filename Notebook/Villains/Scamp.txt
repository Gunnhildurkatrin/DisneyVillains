He is the only son of [[Lady]] and the [[Tramp]].\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\n<br />\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lady and the Tramp]]''===\nHe is seen at the end of the film, but he never talks. [[Lady]] handles him a few times, after tugging on [[Jock]]'s sweater. Lady is fed up and carries him to an open present box, but he makes the box fall and decides to calm down. He then joins his sisters to hear [[Trusty]] (whom they call Uncle Trusty) talk about \"Ol' Reliable.\"\n\n===''[[Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure]]''===\nScamp is very hyperactive and a little immature, and he's also seen to have different appearances, more from [[Lady]] than [[Tramp]]. He is lighter colored, his ears are a little bit longer, and he has the same eye color like Lady. He is a wild, stubborn, angry, energetic puppy.\n\nOriginally, Scamp is exactly what he is named\u2014a frisky, serious scamp of a pup that gets into trouble from time to time as he holds little respect for rules. Scamp goes to being a wild dog, free to run without worries, unhindered by rules or boundaries in \"[[World Without Fences|a world without fences]].\" This puts him in conflict with his father, [[Tramp]], whose past Scamp is originally unaware of, believing Tramp to always dream to be a house pet when he lived the life Scamp wants, but is unaware of the harsh realities of that life. His respect for his father is less than so, as Tramp has put his past behind him and fully embraced the life of a house pet, as well as gaining a clear respect of rules, which he tries to impress upon Scamp.\n\nScamp is also somewhat serious and ill-tempered, putting some trust into [[Buster (Lady and the Tramp)|Buster]], the leader of the Junkyard Dogs, who has a history with Scamp's father. Scamp desired to prove himself worthy of being a Junkyard Dog in Buster's eyes to the point of stealing from his own family and turning his back on his father. Needless to say, Scamp got betrayed when Buster, who figured out Tramp was Scamp's father, leaves him to be captured by [[The Dogcatcher|the dogcatcher]] as revenge against Tramp (in addition to trying to remind Scamp that a Junkyard Dog only helps itself and not others), and Scamp made a regret how much he loves and misses his family. When Tramp saves him, Scamp finally gets a healthy respect for rules and appreciation of the family that loves him and begrudgingly accepts baths.\n\nThroughout his adventure, Scamp had a crush on a young Junkyard Dog named [[Angel (Lady and the Tramp)|Angel]], and she returned his affections in a smug, playful kind of way. History repeated itself when Scamp and Angel went to [[Tony's Restaurant|the very same restaurant]] his parents went, and they both shared a spaghetti meal from [[Tony]] (but in a more messy manner). Scamp was surprised to learn that Angel desired a family like the one he left behind and was astonished to find out he ran away from them, and that she had been in five families but they never worked out. Scamp accidentally betrays Angel by blurting out \"she's the one who wants to be a housedog\" in front of all the Junkyard Dogs, and she runs off, hurt and upset. But when she sees Scamp with the dogcatcher, she comes to his rescue by leading Tramp to the pound and aids in saving Scamp. After leaving Buster in a pile of junk back at [[The Junkyard|the junkyard]], which he caused as payback for what he did to him, Scamp goes home with Angel. To both their joy, Angel is accepted and taken in by Scamp's family so they can always be together.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*He is only seen with [[Annette, Collette, and Danielle|his sisters]] in the original film, comic, and books.\n*In between the long gap between both films, Scamp appeared in many Disney comics, including his own comic strip which ran in newspapers from 1955 to [[1988]].\n*In ''Lady and the Tramp II'', Scamp appears to be the smallest one due to the ending where his sisters are seen to be taller than him though this might not be so as Scamp has a habit of slouching or hunching his shoulders.\n*Scamp has more American Cocker Spaniel in him than terrier due to a few scenes where Tramp takes the chains off him he is lighter colored, when he flops his ears down a couple of times his ears are seen to be longer than Tramp's and his fur size matches Lady's.\n*Scamp and Danielle are the two major gutter mouths and troublemakers in the family.\n*Roger Bart, who provides Scamp's singing voice, previously did the singing for [[Hercules (character)|the titular character]] in [[Hercules]].\n\n==External links==\n*[http://users.cwnet.com/xephyr/rich/dzone/hoozoo/scamp.html Disney's HooZoo - Scamp]\n\n{{Lady and the Tramp}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Lady and the Tramp characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Wonderful World of Color]]"
