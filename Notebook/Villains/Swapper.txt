'''Experiment 355''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]]. He\u00a0is designed to switch people's minds; it is possible for him to swap more than two individuals at once, and he will only switch them back by choice.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nBecause Swapper is two heads on the same body, Swapper is two beings cooperating as one, though their personalities mirror each other: they can be indecisive at times but usually work well together. An example is when [[Stitch]] in [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]]'s body asked the two-headed cousin to switch their minds back, Swapper's left/top, after hesitating, blew a raspberry in response. The two enjoy messing with people by swapping their brains and refuse to switch them back unless threatened. However, Swapper will eventually switch individuals' minds back into their original bodies when both heads choose to do so (or when given \"proper motivation\").\n\n===Physical appearance===\nSwapper is a green lizard-like experiment with two heads on a conjoined body at the rear. Both sides of the body have a set of arms, but only one pair of legs and purple markings extending to each. He has three purple-tipped tendrils on each head.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nSwapper can emit a green ray from each head's eyes once each head is pointed at one of two individuals. The ray will swap the minds and voices of the targets, as well as vice versa, and the only means of returning to normal is through Swapper choosing to do so.  It even works if one or both targets are on a video screen, or if Swapper is encased in clear glass (unless the glass is covered from the experiment's view).  Although he normally uses his power on two people, Swapper isn't limited to this specifically, since he was able to hit four beings at once. He can also scale walls and roll into a wheel-like shape.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment 355 was the 355th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to swap any two (or more) individuals' minds. According to Jumba, 355 once swapped the former and his wife for an entire month, which led to a divorce in the end. 355 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.\n\nAt an unknown point after this, Experiment 355 was activated and captured by [[Gantu]].\n\nWhen Gantu\u00a0was about to teleport\u00a0355 to [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]], 355 got loose and swapped Gantu and H\u00e4msterviel's minds, allowing 355 to escape. H\u00e4msterviel in Gantu's body then decided to go AWOL and recapture 355, but refused to have 355 switch their minds back afterwards, although Gantu in H\u00e4msterviel's body protested.\n\nSometime later, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Stitch]] encountered 355 in [[Kokaua Town|town]] and managed to capture him in a containment orb, but 355 was able to swap their minds in the process. After 355, named Swapper, refused to switch Lilo and Stitch's minds back, they took him [[Lilo's House|home]], where [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] covered up Swapper's container with a towel to\u00a0prevent\u00a0the latter from using his mind-swapping power on the former.\n\nWhen [[Pleakley]] removed the towel, Swapper switched his and Jumba's minds as well, forcing Lilo's dysfunctional [[Pelekai \u02bbohana|''\u02bbohana'']] to throw a \"Lilo's Not Weird\" party that she hosted earlier. As soon as [[Victoria]],\u00a0[[Mertle Edmonds|Mertle]], and [[Elena, Teresa, and Yuki|the hula girls]] showed up, the four attempted to act like the other's self as they entertained their guests, which proved to be difficult for all of them.\n\nLater, Gantu with H\u00e4msterviel's mind arrived at the Pelekais' house (after being tipped by H\u00e4msterviel with Gantu's mind) for Swapper, where a fight ensued during which Swapper switched Lilo, Stitch, Jumba and Pleakley's minds again, though each one was in someone else's body.\n\nAfter H\u00e4msterviel in Gantu's body was defeated, Swapper switched Lilo, Stitch, Jumba and Pleakley's minds back into their original bodies, and he was then forced to do the same with Gantu and H\u00e4msterviel's minds as well, after Jumba threatened to feed him Pleakley's disgusting cuisine (specifically Aunt Pleakley's famous chocolate green bean surprise) for dinner.  Afterwards, Lilo and Stitch finds the one true place for Swapper (although where it is was unknown).\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nThe first 624 experiments, including Swapper, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium\u00a0to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]] and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nSwapper participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]], but it is unknown what he did.\n\nThe Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe. Swapper joins them for the song by playing the keyboard.\n\n===''[[Stitch!]]''===\nSwapper made an appearance in the ''Stitch!'' anime where [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]] used him to switch [[Stitch]] and [[Hiroman]]'s bodies. It is also revealed that Swapper is capable of speaking fluently. Until they could find Swapper again, Hiroman needed to figure out how to use Stitch's abilities to take on [[Heat]] when he attacked. After Heat, [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]], and [[Reuben]] were defeated, [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] made a request for Swapper to swap Stitch and Hiroman back into their original bodies, but instead of obeying, he switched everyone's bodies again. He later appeared in the special ''Stitch and the Planet of Sand''.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Swapper's appearance is a reference\u00a0to conjoined twins of people or animals.\n*Swapper was activated off-screen.\n*Swapper is one of three known experiments that has more than one head, the other two being [[Forehead]] and [[627]], having\u00a0four heads and two heads respectively, though 627 usually only appears with one head.\n*Similar to  [[Splodyhead]], [[Clink]], and [[Plasmoid]], Swapper has six limbs. However, unlike those three, Swapper does not use all six for locomotion.\n*Swapper's ability to {{WikipediaLink|Body swap|swap victims' bodies}} is a very common TV trope seen in various fictional media, also known as a [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFridayFlip ''Freaky Friday'' Flip], named after [[wikipedia:Freaky Friday|the 1972 novel]]\u00a0and its [[Freaky Friday (1976)|three]] [[Freaky Friday (1995)|film]] [[Freaky Friday (2003)|adaptations]]\u00a0(also produced by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]).\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Multi-headed characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Twins and Triplets]]"
