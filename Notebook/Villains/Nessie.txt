She is a homeless creature that attempts to find a home.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nNessie is a sweet and beautiful creature. She gets sad very easily when something awful happens to her. For example, [[MacFroogle]] taking over her home to make it a golf course.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[The Ballad of Nessie]]''===\nNessie once lived a peaceful life in a small pond with her rubber duck McQuack, until Tycoon [[MacFroogle]] paved it and the surrounding land over to create a golf course. Though so distressed that she wanted to cry, she was dissuaded from this course by an observing bird and so decided instead to find a new home. However, every attempt proved fruitless, and each observer she encountered expressed the same sentiment against crying as the bird. Finally, after a long journey without success, Nessie broke down and cried a literal flood of tears; once they were spent, she discovered to her astonishment that they had produced a perfect new home for her: [[Loch Ness]], where she and her rubber duck, MacQuack would live peacefully forever afterwards.\n\n===Other appearances===\nA Nessie plush appears in two scenes in ''[[Prep & Landing: Naughty vs. Nice]]'', first on the screen of the elves as the toy that [[Timmy Terwelp]] wants, and then among [[Grace Goodwin]]'s toys.\n\nNessie can be spotted in two scenes as a figurine in the holiday short ''[[Olaf's Frozen Adventure]]''. She is first spotted during the musical number \"[[That Time of Year]]\" and later during the scene when the sled is on fire.\n\nNessie's face is seen on the back of a newspaper in ''[[Monsters at Work]]'' in the episode \"[[The Big Wazowskis]]\". The paper says \"Nessie's Secrets Unloched\", implying that she is the Loch Ness Monster that Mike had mentioned in ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' who had gotten banished in the first place along with [[Bigfoot]] and the [[Yeti (Monsters, Inc.)|Abominable Snowman]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nNessie3.png\nThe ballad of nessie 3large.jpg\nNessieConcept Deja.jpg|Nessie concept art by Andreas Deja.\nNessieConcept Deja2.jpg|Nessie concept art by Andreas Deja.\nNessieConcept Deja3.jpg|More art by Andreas Deja.\nPreplanding-nn-nessiemon.jpg|1st appearance as a plush in ''[[Prep & Landing: Naughty vs. Nice]]''.\nPreplanding-nn-mickeyplush.jpg|2nd appearance as a plush in ''Prep & Landing: Naughty vs. Nice''.\nThe Big Wazowskis Nessie.jpg|Cameo in ''[[Monsters at Work]]''.\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Scottish characters]]\n[[Category:Sea Monsters]]\n[[Category:Reptiles]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]"
