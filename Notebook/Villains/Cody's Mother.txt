She is widowed, because [[Cody (The Rescuers)|Cody]] mentions in the film that his father has died. Throughout the film, her face was never shown on the screen, but the back of her head was visible in a scene when a ranger is giving Cody's backpack to her.\n\n==Role in the film==\nIn the beginning, Cody's mother is seen in the kitchen cleaning dishes and listening to the radio. She then hears Cody sneaking out of the house and asks him about his breakfast to which he tells her that he has some sandwiches in his backpack. She then tells him to be home for supper to which he replies \"No worries.\"\n\nLater on in the film when Cody doesn't return home for dinner, his mother goes outside and calls for him (not knowing he's been kidnapped by a poacher named [[Percival C. McLeach|Percival McLeach]]) and when he doesn't come back or respond, she has the local rangers look for him. Later on, one is seen giving his backpack to her, which was found near Crocodile Falls and it is believed by the rangers that he had been attacked by the crocodiles and is either dead or still missing, but the rangers decide to call off the search for him.\n\nCody's mother isn't seen again for the rest of the the film after the scene where the ranger gives her his backpack. However, she'd be happy and relieved to be reunited with him when he returns home safely with [[Bernard (The Rescuers)|Bernard]], [[Bianca]], [[Jake (The Rescuers)|Jake]], and [[Marahute]] and then realizes it was McLeach who was really responsible for his kidnapping, and heard that he has fall down the waterfall.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"185\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nCody's mother with backpack.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Rescuers}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:The Rescuers characters]]\n[[Category:Australian characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Unseen characters]]\n[[Category:Widows/Widowers]]"
