She lives in New Zealand, and she's the leader of the local M\u0101ori village, in a desperate trial against [[Fenimore Cook]], who wants to destroy her village and her people. She is a very authoritative woman, feared also by her son, who thinks is better to not oppose at her decisions.\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nAngus_and_Rangi_Fangus.jpg|Rangi with her son\nRangi_Fangus_2.jpg \n</gallery>\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fangus, Rangi}}\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{PKNA}}\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Parents]]"
