He is [[Maid Marian (1952 character)|Maid Marian]]'s father, [[Robin Hood (1952 character)|Robin Fitzooth]]'s possible future father-in-law, [[Hugh Fitzooth]] and [[Tyb]]'s boss, and the ruler of Huntingdon Manor.\n\n==Role in the film==\nAt [[Huntingdon Manor]], the Earl of Huntingdon is first seen preparing himself to leave for [[Nottingham Castle]] at [[Nottingham (1952 location)|Nottingham]] to join [[King Richard (1952 character)|King Richard]] on the Crusade until he hears his servant, [[Tyb]] calling for his daughter, [[Maid Marian (1952 character)|Maid Marian]]. When the Earl asks Tyb if his daughter is ready, Tyb assures her master that she'll have her ready, making her a sight for [[Queen Eleanor]] to accept to take care of in his absence while he is fighting side by side with King Richard on the Crusade. So, the Earl asks her to find his daughter quickly before they leave for Nottingham.\n\nOnce the Earl and his daughter arrive at Nottingham Castle, he greets King Richard, his younger brother, [[Prince John (1952 character)|Prince John]], and their mother, [[Queen Eleanor]]. Before leaving, the Earl asks the Queen to look after his daughter in his absence, which the Queen gladly accepts. Later, King Richard asks a blessing from the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] for his Crusade. Once King Richard and the Earl of Huntingdon are gone, Prince John appoints a new man to be his own new [[Sheriff of Nottingham (1952 character)|Sheriff of Nottingham]] and reveals his true nature and intentions, which is to raise taxes and collect money from the poor in his brother's absence and as long as his mother and the Archbishop of Canterbury remain oblivious to the plot. Luckily, [[Robin Hood (1952 character)|Robin Hood]] and his Merrie Men are willing to restore order in the kingdom in the King's absence.\n\nTwo years have passed, King Richard's Crusade has ended in failure, and the King finds himself imprisoned in Austria to be held for a ransom of 100,000 marks; much to the Queen and Archbishop's dismay and Prince John's joy. Nevertheless, Robin and his men do everything they can to ensure their benevolent king's safe return with contributions and foiling Prince John's plans concerning the ransom.\n\nA few days later, after Prince John's defeat and the Sheriff's death, the Earl of Huntingdon is last heard by King Richard, who has safely returned to England after his ransom's been paid, awaiting his daughter at Huntingdon Manor where the Queen vows to marry her to Robin Hood, now knighted the Earl of Locksley.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"180\">\nTyb (1).png|The Earl of Huntingdon with [[Tyb]]\nEarlcome.png|The Earl arriving at Nottingham Castle\nRicchardearl.png|The Earl with [[King Richard (1952 character)|King Richard]], [[Prince John (1952 character)|Prince John]], and [[Queen Eleanor]]\nRichardmarian.png|The Earl introducing his daughter, [[Maid Marian (1952 character)|Maid Marian]] and leaving her in the Queen's care\nRichardblessing.png|The Earl and everyone else blessed by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]\nEarlleave.png|The Earl leaving for the Crusade\n</gallery>\n{{The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:English characters]]\n\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Knights]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Horsemen]]\n[[Category:Widows/Widowers]]"
