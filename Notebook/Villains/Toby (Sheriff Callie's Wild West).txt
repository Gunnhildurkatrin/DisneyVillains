He is voiced by [[Jessica DiCicco]]. Toby is a kindhearted cactus that is best friends with [[Deputy Peck]].\u00a0\n==Personality==\nToby is polite and friendly towards everyone in [[Nice and Friendly Corners]]. He is especially close to Deputy Peck and [[Sheriff Callie]].\u00a0\n\nHowever, sometimes he can be a little immature, such as in \"Toby's Untrue Achoo!\" when he faked being sick in order to get some attention. In \"[[Toby the Cowsitter]]\", he offers to watch a group of cows and then leaves to get milkshakes, suggesting he's also forgetful.\u00a0\n\nHe's also very innocent, rarely ever understanding the times he's being swindled or even insulted, such as in \"Peck Takes it Back\", where Peck calls him a pinecone. Instead, Toby goes out to find an actual pinecone for Peck because he believes he didn't know what they looked like. He doesn't seem to hold grudges or get angry easily, either, even after his skills are criticized in \"[[Horseshoe Peck]]\". In \"[[Toby Braves the Bully]]\" he is against telling Callie and Peck about his bully because he thinks it would make him a tattletale.\u00a0\n\nToby is usually very cheerful and he loves to dance. He is also shown to love popcorn in several episodes, as well as milkshakes.\u00a0\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\">\nSC CTW0.png|Toby in ''The Cat Who Tamed the West''.\nSC CTW4.png|Toby and Peck in ''The Cat Who Tamed the West''.\nSC TBB2.png|Toby delivering mail in ''Toby Braves the Bully''.\nSC TMM3.png|Toby and Peck in ''Peck's Trail Mix Mix-Up''.\nCallieTobyPeck_Intro.png|Toby and friends in the Season 2 intro.\nToby_SC1_1.png|Toby is hurt by Peck's bragging.\nTobyPeck_SC2_1.png\nToby_SC12_1.png|Toby grows a desert flower on his nose.\nToby_SC13_1.png\nToby_SC32_1.png|Trying to fix Callie's quilt in ''Peck and Toby's Big Yarn''.\nTobyPeck_SC46_1.png\nToby_SC46_1.png\nToby_SC46_3.png\nPrickly_Pals.png|Toby dancing with Polly May Porcupine.\nTobyElla_SC46_1.png\nToby_SC46_6.png\nToby_SC46_2.png\nToby_SC46_4.png|\"A cowboy hat?\"\nToby_SC47_1.png\nTobyPriscilla SC47 2.png\nTobyPriscilla SC47 1.png\nToby_SC54_1.png\nToby_SC54_2.png|Toby becomes friends with Comet.\nToby_SC55_1.png\nTobyPeck_SC57_1.png\nTobyPeckKit_SC56_1.png|Toby with his thieving lookalike, [[Kit Cactus]].\n</gallery>\n\n{{Sheriff Callie's Wild West}}\n[[Category:Sheriff Callie's Wild West characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Plants]]\n[[Category:Character stubs]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Cowboys & cowgirls]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Songwriters]]\n[[Category:Singer-songwriters]]"
