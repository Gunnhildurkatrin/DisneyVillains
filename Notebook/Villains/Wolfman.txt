He is a werewolf and a resident of [[Halloween Town]]. Compared most other residents of the town, Wolfman enjoys Halloween and spooky events, and even helps [[Jack Skellington|Jack]] make [[Christmas]] theirs.  \n\n==Background==\nLittle to nothing is known about Wolfman prior to ''The Nightmare Before Christmas''. He had been a longtime citizen of Halloween Town and is in close relations with its members. \n\n===Personality===\nLike the rest of the werewolves, Wolfman is fierce, stern, and a little bit gruff. But when he heard the sad news of Jack being blown to smithereens, he became filled with grief as he howled.\n===Physical appearance===\nHe is based on a werewolf in folktales with brown fur, sharp teeth, and wearing a squared-pattern coat-shirt.\n==Appearances==\n===''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]''===\nWolfman appears in ''The Nightmare Before Christmas''. He is seen during the musical performance \u201c[[This is Halloween]]\u201d and delivers the like \u201cAren\u2019t you scared?\u201d \n\nAfter the performance is over, Wolfman is seen celebrating their accomplishment and asks some of the residents if it was terrifying. Wolfman also attends the award ceremony that is presented and hosted by [[Mayor of Halloween Town|the Mayor]].\n\nLater, the Mayor worries something terrible might\u2019ve happened to Jack, and warns the citizens, worrying that next Halloween might be canceled. Wolfman, after the Mayor says there\u2019s only 365 days left until next Halloween, corrects him and says \u201c364.\u201d Afterwards, he helps in searching for Jack.\n\nJack later returns from [[Christmas Town]] and tells the Mayor to call a town meeting. During the meeting, Wolfman hears in on Jack\u2019s experienced with Christmas and his feelings for the so-called holiday. The Mayor then endorses the holiday by calling it \u201cfun,\u201d leaving the other citizens and residents happy and excited to celebrate.\n\nLater, Wolfman helps the residents build toys for the holiday, ignoring [[Sally]]\u2019s pleas to Jack, her premonition of the dangers that might happen.\n\n[[Lock, Shock, and Barrel]] return to the town with [[Santa Claus (The Nightmare Before Christmas)|Santa Claus]] and open the bag up that\u2019s holding him inside. Wolfman watches Jack chat with the saint and is surprised to see him, and is later carried away to [[Oogie Boogie]].\n\nJack later prepares to take off, taking Santa\u2019s place as Santa Claus. However, Sally fogs the runway, leaving the residents sad that Christmas is ruined. Soon after, [[Zero]] shows up and helps Jack guide his way out, and Wolfman cheers. \n\nWolfman watches Jack on his journey, alongside other residents. He is seen cheering when Jack delivers the presents, but when Jack is blown out of the sky and presumed dead by the Mayor, he howls in sadness and the other residents cry with him. The Mayor then goes around the town to deliver the news to the rest of the residents.\n\nWolfman is surprised when Jack returns later that night, alive and well. He and the other residents welcome Jack, the Mayor, Sally, and the kids back from wherever they came, and later notice Santa in the sky. Soon after, it starts snowing, and Wolfman starts playing with the snow, taking part by singing \u201cWhat\u2019s This?\u201d\n\n==Relationships==\n\n=== [[Harlequin Demon]] ===\nThe Harlequin Demon and Wolfman are usually seen together throughout the film, and appear to be close friends. \n\n=== [[Jack Skellington]] ===\nWolfman appears to have a likeness for Jack, and loves his performance at the end of Halloween. \n\n=== [[Mayor of Halloween Town|The Mayor]] ===\nWolfman and the Mayor appear to have a history together.
