He lives in [[Mediterranean Harbor]] and loves to draw pictures.|Gelatoni's backstory.}}\n'''Gelatoni''' (\u30b8\u30a7\u30e9\u30c8\u30fc\u30cb) is a cat appearing in [[Mediterranean Harbor]] at [[Tokyo DisneySea]].\n\n==Background==\nOne day while visiting Italy on their spring voyage, [[Duffy the Disney Bear|Duffy]] and [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] were out for a stroll while [[Minnie Mouse|Minnie]] and [[ShellieMay the Disney Bear|ShellieMay]] did some shopping. Suddenly...\n\n\"Oh no! My gelato!\" cried Duffy, as his sweet treat plopped to the ground.\n\n\"Va bene, don't worry,\" said the gray tuxedo cat in the bright blue beret. \"Ciao! I'm Gelatoni.\" And the funny little cat dipped his tail in the melting gelato and began painting with it. Duffy smiled and said, \"I'm Duffy.\"\n\n\"I wanna paint, too!\" Duffy cheered. \"Certamente, Duffy! Let's paint together!\"\nreplied Gelatoni.\n\nAfter they finished, the two new friends happily exchanged their masterpieces. \"Let's play again sometime!\" they both agreed.\n\n===Duffy and Gelatoni===\nOne day, [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] and [[Duffy the Disney Bear|Duffy]] were visiting [[Mediterranean Harbor]]. Mickey was taken by the lovely view. \"Oh boy! This place is beautiful!\"\n\nWhile strolling around the scenic neighborhood, Mickey bought Duffy a gelato.\n\n\"Ooooo, this looks yummy!\" As Duffy was about to have a taste, the gelato fell to the ground. \"Oh no!\"\n\nJust then, a boy kitten appeared and said to Duffy, \"Don't worry. Watch this!\"\n\nThe kitten used his long tail as a brush and started to paint a picture with the dropped gelato.\n\n\"That's amazing! I'm Duffy.\" \"Ciao! Call me Gelatoni.\"\n\n\"Gelatoni, I want to draw, too.\" \"Okay, then let's draw together!\"\n\nThe two drew many pictures using a variety of things...paints, pastels, color pencils, brushes, hands, and tails!\n\n\"You know, everything has heart,\" Gelatoni said to Duffy. Just then Duffy started to see the flowers smiling at him!\n\nAs the sun began to set, they decided to draw their last pictures.\n\nWhen they showed their pictures to each other, they realized they had both drawn a picture of the two of them standing side by side, like good friends! That made them happy.\n\nIt was time for Duffy to return to Cape Cod. They exchanged their pictures and said, \"Let's play together again!\"\n\nAfter coming back to their own homes, Duffy and Gelatoni hung their pictures in their favorite places.\n\nThe pictures made them feel like they were right next to each other. The two friends hoped they would meet again soon.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nGelatoni plush.png|A Gelatoni plush.\nGelatoni plush badge.png|A Gelatoni plush badge.\nGelatoni plush strap.png|A Gelatoni plush strap.\nGelatoni pen.png|A Gelatoni 6-color pen.\nGelatoni pen close up.png|A Gelatoni 6-color pen (detail).\nGelatoni and Duffy memo.png|A Gelatoni memo set.\nGelatoni folder.png|A Gelatoni clear folder.\nGoods ph0008.png|A Gelatoni shopping bag.\nGelatoni tote bag.png|A Gelatoni tote bag.\nDuffy and Gelatoni portrait.jpg|[[Duffy the Disney Bear|Duffy]] and Gelatoni.\nDuffy ShellieMay Gelatoni Main Street Cinema.jpg|[[Duffy the Disney Bear|Duffy]], [[ShellieMay the Disney Bear|ShellieMay]] and Gelatoni posing at the [[Main Street Cinema (Hong Kong Disneyland)|Main Street Cinema]] in [[Main Street, U.S.A.]] at [[Hong Kong Disneyland]].\nGelatoni, Duffy ShellieMay in Cape Cod.jpg|Gelatoni, [[Duffy the Disney Bear|Duffy]] and [[ShellieMay the Disney Bear|ShellieMay]] in Cape Cod in [[American Waterfront]] at [[Tokyo DisneySea]].\nGelatoni.jpg|A Gelatoni Tsum Tsum.\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.tokyodisneyresort.jp/treasure/duffy/ The official Tokyo DisneySea page for Duffy and Friends] ('''Japanese \u65e5\u672c''')\n* [http://www.tokyodisneyresort.jp/treasure/duffy/gelatoni/ The official Tokyo DisneySea page for Duffy and Friends: Gelatoni] ('''Japanese \u65e5\u672c''')\n\n{{DisneyTsumTsum}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tokyo DisneySea]]\n[[Category:Tokyo Disney Resort]]\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Toys]]\n[[Category:Hong Kong Disneyland]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Tsum Tsum characters]]\n[[Category:Italian characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Shanghai Disneyland]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Artists]]\n[[Category:Duffy and Friends]]\n[[Category:Aulani]]"
