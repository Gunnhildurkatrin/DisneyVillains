They are divine immortals who control the forces of nature. They are related to the older [[Titans]], their ancestors, and chief enemies. There are now twelve major gods who rule over the country, the Olympians, all of whom are under the absolute rule of [[Zeus (Hercules)|Zeus]], king of the gods. They reside high above on [[Mount Olympus]] where they discuss affairs related to the mortal world or matters regarding monsters or disorders in nature.\n\n==Background==\n===Physical Appearance===\nAll Olympian gods and goddesses are human in appearance but far greater in height and stature; though they can manifest themselves to the heights of typical humans for interactions sake. They possess a glowing aura of divinity emitting from their body; also, they possess a wide range of skin and hair color.\n\n===Powers and Abilities===\nThe Olympians Gods and Goddesses are incredibly powerful beings that possess abilities such as: nigh-omnipotence, immortality, superhuman strength, shape-shifting, teleportation, and omnipresence. The gods also possess energy-based abilities, such as magical powers and energy projection. They can grant powers to non-godly thing, since some are capable of life-giving to objects or giving supernatural powers tothose  who don't possess it with ease. However, unlike in myth, their superhuman physical capabilities seem more restricted.\n\nSome gods have abilities related to their specific domain. For instance, Poseidon has control over water, and Apollo having control over the sun.\n\nThough they are mighty, the gods do have weaknesses. Magic can harm them; also, they can't break through magic chains.\n\n==Olympian Gods and Goddesses==\nThis list consists of gods who only have any significant role in the animated series.\n*'''[[Apollo (Hercules)|Apollo]]''': God of the Sun, music, prophecy and twin brother of Artemis.\n*'''[[Ares]]''': God of war, brother of Athena, and founder of Sparta.\n*'''[[Artemis]]''': Goddess of the Moon, hunting and wildlife, twin sister of Apollo.\n*'''[[Athena]]''': Goddess of wisdom, handicrafts, warfare, sister of Ares and founder of Athens.\n*'''[[Aphrodite]]''': Goddess of love, fertility, beauty and desire.\n*'''[[Dionysus]]''': God of wine and celebrations.\n*'''[[Demeter]]''': Goddess of the earth, harvest, fruits, flowers, mother to Persephone and elder sister to Zeus, Poseidon and Hades.\n*'''[[Hades]]''': God of the underworld and brother of Zeus.\n*'''[[Hephaestus]]''': God of the fire, forge and fiancee of Aphrodite.\n*'''[[Hera]]''': Queen of the gods, and goddess of marriage, childbirth and womanhood.\n*'''[[Hermes]]''': God of travelers, thieves and messenger of the gods.\n*'''[[Hestia]]''': Goddess of the hearth and family.\n*'''[[Poseidon]]''': God of the seas, brother of Zeus and husband of Amphitrite.\n*'''[[Zeus (Hercules)|Zeus]]''': King of the Greek gods, and god of sky, justice and lightning.\n\n===Minor Gods and Goddesses===\n*'''Persephone''': Goddess of earth, spring and nature and the wife of [[Hades]].\n*'''[[Amphitrite]]''': Goddess of the sea and wife of Poseidon.\n*'''[[Boreas (Hercules)|Boreas]]''': God of winds.\n*'''[[Cupid]]''': God of passion whose duty is to make others fall in love.\n*'''[[Fates]]''': The immortals with the power of prophecy, who weave the tapestry of fate and history of gods and mortals.\n*'''[[Iris]]''': Goddess of the rainbow.

With the exception of recognizing Ares and Athena being brother and sister, and Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades being brothers, these blood relations are seemingly disregarded in the Disney interpretations. The gods and goddesses' penchant for infidelity, another recurring motif in Olympian mythology, is also disregarded for obvious reasons.\n*A lot of the gods and goddesses are portrayed as being much more benevolent in the movie than in the original myths, especially Hera and Zeus. Conversely, Hades is portrayed as being more malevolent than in the myths.\n*In ''[[Once Upon a Time]]'', [[Poseidon]], [[Hades]] and [[Zeus (Hercules)|Zeus]] are the only Olympian Gods who appear in the show. The demi-god Hercules also appears. In the case of Demeter and Persephone, their roles were replaced by [[Queen of Hearts|Cora]] and [[Theodora the Wicked Witch of the West|Zelena]].\n\n{{Hercules}}\n[[Category:Gods]]\n[[Category:Hercules characters]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Immortal]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Greek Mythology]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Olympian Gods]]\n[[Category:Greek characters]]\n[[Category:Goddesses]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Once Upon a Time characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
