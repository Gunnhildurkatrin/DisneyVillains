She and [[Giselle (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Giselle]] were believed to be prostitutes. Scarlett had bright red hair and was typically seen wearing a fiery, red dress with an excessive amount of blush on her face.\n\n===Development History===\nScarlett was based on the [[Redd|redheaded wench]], in the Auction scene of the [[Pirates of the Caribbean|''Pirates of the Caribbean'' attraction]], commonly referred to as the \"Redhead\". When she was adapted into the ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' films, the character was given the name \"Scarlett\", because of her red hair.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl|The Curse of the Black Pearl]]''===\nScarlett had a history with [[Jack Sparrow]], but developed animosity towards him which manifested itself in a slap to the face upon seeing Jack again in [[Tortuga]]. Jack commented that he hadn't deserved the slap, though one from Giselle's moments later was, as he believed, that was justified.\n\n===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|Dead Man's Chest]]''===\nDespite the divide between them, Scarlett and Giselle were often seen in each other's company in Tortuga, and were both approached by [[William Turner Jr.|William Turner]] a year later, during the latter's search for Sparrow, though Scarlett claimed Jack had not been seen for over a month.\n\n===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|At World's End]]''===\nJack was ultimately reunited with Scarlett following his rescue from Davy Jones' Locker and end of the Battle of Calypso's maelstrom, and was again greeted with a slap after admitting he loved neither Scarlett nor Giselle. [[Joshamee Gibbs]] departed with Scarlett and Giselle as Jack set off on his quest to find the [[Fountain of Youth]].\n\n==Trivia==\n*Scarlett was portrayed by [[Lauren Maher]] in ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl|The Curse of the Black Pearl]]'', ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|Dead Man's Chest]]'', and ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|At World's End]]''.
