She comes off as a friendly, yet frail old woman who is willing to lend an ear or offer kind words to those she meets. She is a very private person and tends to keep quiet about herself. However, underneath all that lies a crafty woman with a hint of feistiness about her. Croaker can be a wily septuagenarian if provoked and has pulled the rug over those that are the target of her scorn (such as [[Sprig Plantar|Sprig]] whom she has a love-hate relationship with). If someone is being indirect with her she will go out of her way to teach them a lesson.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nCroaker is a light violet colored frog with a violet-pink underbelly and four fingers and, presumably, two toes. She has a tall fluffy grey hair, a darker purple spot on her head (most likely a liver spot) and noticeable wrinkles. She also has distinctly frog like eyes (ironically as the other frogs have typical cartoon eyes) that are pale yellow with her left eye having a black pupil and her right eye having a milky grey pupil.\n\nDress wise, she wears a brownish rag dress and a white neckerchief slung over her back. She has light black slippers and to top it all off has a walking cane which she is shown to be proficient in using as a weapon.\n\n===Abilities===\n\n*'''Martial artist:''' Sadie has shown a hidden ability to defend herself in combat whenever situations get tough.\n*'''Covert skills:''' Sadie is a former super spy and occasionally uses them to continue work even after her supposed retirement.\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*In \"[[Cracking Mrs. Croaker]]\", Croaker states that she does not like Sprig, but she is shown interacting with him in episodes like they have a mutual relationship.\n*The fact that her name is \"Mrs.\" implies that she was married at one point.\n*She does not want anyone knowing about her background as a spy because according to her, \"it would be very bad for everyone.\"\n*According to [[Maddie Flour]], she smells like wet leaves and fungus.\n*Stumpy seems to not think much of her.\n*[[Leopold Loggle]] states that she looked the same when he was a kid.\n*She has been shopping at Plantars' since she was a little girl and apparently knew Hop Pop's father.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"185\" captionalign=\"center\">\nAnne or Beast 4.jpg\nLily Pad Thai - Sadie Croaker and Anne.jpg\nToad Tax 1.png\nHop-Popular 1.png\nThe Big Bugball Game - Team.png\nMrs Croaker render.png|Render\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n\n*[[w:c:amphibiapedia:Sadie Croaker|Sadie Croaker]] at the [[w:c:amphibiapedia:Main Page|Amphibia Wiki]]\n\n{{Amphibia}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Amphibia characters]]\n[[Category:Frogs]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Spies]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]"
