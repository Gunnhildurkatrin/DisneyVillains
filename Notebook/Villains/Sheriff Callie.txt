She is the sheriff of [[Nice and Friendly Corners]] and is an excellent singer-songwriter and musician of the series. Callie is a tomboyish but beautiful calico cat who is always ready to lend a hand. She is charged with making sure the town upholds its reputation for being the friendliest town in the West.\n\n==Background==\nCallie works closely with [[Deputy Peck]], and [[Toby (Sheriff Callie's Wild West)|Toby]]. She is also inseparable from her lightning-fast horse, [[Sparky (Sheriff Callie's Wild West)|Sparky]].\n\nPerhaps her\u00a0greatest talent is the use of her noodle lasso for show and sport. Because the lasso is magic, it can take the form of other objects like hammers and stairs. In many events, it has saved Callie and the others from trouble. Callie sings and writes songs as she plays her guitar called \"Sweet Strings\" in numerous episodes to accompany it.\n\nCallie is all about helping others, fixing things, and giving advice. Whenever there is a lesson in an episode, she is usually the one to help others see it.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Callie shares many traits with [[Wander]], from ''[[Wander Over Yonder]]'':\n**Both have southern accents.\n**Both play an instrument in a majority of their songs that they wrote (Callie: Acoustic guitar, Wander: Banjo), both of which have a set of stars on them.\n**Both have a blue horse as a sidekick (Callie: Sparky, Wander: [[Sylvia]]).\n**Both wear a star on their outfits (Callie: Sheriff Star, Wander: Star button on hat).\n**Both wear hats.\n* Her name Callie is wordplay on calico cat.\n* When the show was in a development stage, it was titled Oki's Oasis, implying her name would have been Oki.\n* Callie named her guitar Sweet Strings, and mentions that her mother gave it to her when she was still a kitten, implying that she has played it for a long time. Adding to her musical skills, she is shown to have the ability to out-sing music bandits. \n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\">\nSC CTW0.png|Sheriff Callie's first story in the book, ''The Cat Who Tamed the West''.\nCallieridesparky.png\nCallie sparky.png\nSC CTW2.png|Sheriff Callie and Sparky from ''The Cat Who Tamed the West''.\nSC CTW3.png|Sheriff Callie and Sparky after a long ride.\nCallieTobyPeck Intro.png|Callie and friends in the 2nd season opening.\nCalliePeck SC52 2.png\nCalliePeck SC56 1.png\nCallieSparky SC52 1.png\nCallieSparky SC53 2.png\nCallie and Frida Lasso.png\nCallieTownsfolk.png\nSheriff Callie gasps when the brach snaps back at her.png\nCallie's_belt_gets_hooked_by_the_branch.png\nCallie_gets_stuck_on_the_branch.png\nSheriff Callie hanging from a tree.png\nSheriff Callie hanging.png\nSheriff Callie mad.png\nSheriff Callie Season Two Intro.png|Callie and Sparky from the Season Two intro.\n</gallery>\n\n{{Sheriff Callie's Wild West}}\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Sheriffs]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Sheriff Callie's Wild West characters]]\n[[Category:Cowboys & cowgirls]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females|Sheriff Callie]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Songwriters]]\n[[Category:Singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]"
