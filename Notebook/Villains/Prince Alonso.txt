He is the Prince of [[Cordoba]].\n\n\n==Personality==\nAlonso is a foolish fop who's narcissistic, a lazy coward, spoiled playboy, and a bit of a clown. He used hate\u00a0doing work and prefered\u00a0to have fun. He's also shown to be shameless to the point where he blames others for trouble he's caused. However, Elena has shown to have inspired him to be kind and more responsible later on, such as sacrificing himself for Valentina and being turned into an animal in \"[[Coronation Day]]\".\n\n==Role in the Series==\nAlonso makes his debut in \"[[Prince Too Charming]]\". He first appears when he gets back to Cordoba Castle. He quickly showed his true colors as the foolish fop he is and flirts with Elena and he also quickly starts treating Gabe like a bellhop. While his father shows Elena the model for the new bridge, Alonso plays with the figurines. When they gets to the site, Alonso dismisses the warnings about it being the Yacalli's territory and takes Elena away for a picnic.\n\nLater, one of his Guards comes over and reveals that the Yacalli is attacking the workers. He and Elena head back and see the [[Yacalli]] for themselves. The Yacalli, after Alonso refuses to leave, declares that he will destroy Cordoba Castle. Gabe, to get back at him, shuts the door to his chariot on him and makes him ride back on Pedro, an aged horse. When Alonso finally gets back to the palace, he tries to pin the blame for the entire thing on Elena and the workers and is shocked when Juan believes Elena instead of him. After Elena stops the Yacalli, Juan has him help build the new bridge to teach him a lesson in responsibility.\n\nHe appears as a more responsible and kinder person in the episode [[A Lava Story|\"A Lava Story\"]]. When he tells his father that he has changed, his father tells him that he has not seen evidence of it and says that \"actions speak louder than words\". Later, when Charoca laments about how Charica would not forgive him despite being honest, Alonso gives him advice he received from his father: ''show'' how much he cares and loves Charica. Charoca takes his advice, which makes him reconcile with Charica. After the problem is solved, Alonso finally proves himself to his father and gains his approval.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\">\nCharming Elena.png\nFeel Free to Have Fun.jpg\nPrince Too Charming 1.png\nMasks of Magic 27.jpg\nMasks of Magic 28.jpg\nA Lava Story 4.jpg\nA Lava Story 8.jpg\nA Lava Story 9.jpg\nA Lava Story 13.jpg\n</gallery>\n==Trivia==\n*How he looks at his own reflection is a reference to the Greek myth\u00a0Narcissus.\n*According to Elena, coconut gives Alonso a stomach ache as revealed in \"[[Elena's Day Off]]\".\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Elena of Avalor}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Alonso, Prince}}\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Elena of Avalor characters]]\n[[Category:Princes]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
