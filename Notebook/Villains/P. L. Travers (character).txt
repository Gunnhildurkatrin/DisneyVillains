Travers is the author of the 1934 novel\u00a0''Mary Poppins''. In the early 1960s, she struggles with [[Walt Disney (Saving Mr. Banks character)|Walt Disney]] and his studio's attempts to convince her to sell the film rights to the novel.\n\nIn the film, Travers is portrayed by [[Emma Thompson]] as an adult and by Annie Rose Buckley as a child, where she is referred to by her birth name of Helen. Though based on the real Travers, several elements of the film's depiction of her and her story are dramatized and fictionalized.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The movie ends without showing Travers' reaction to the film, other than indifference before the film begins. In real life, she lambasted the film to the point that her last will and testament stated that no Americans be allowed to adapt her work. In [[1977]], she softened on her opinion of the film stating \"I've seen it once or twice, and I've learned to live with it. It's glamorous and it's a good film on its own level, but I don't think it is very like my books.\"\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Travers, Pamela Lyndon}}\n[[Category:Saving Mr. Banks characters]]\n[[Category:Characters based on real people]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:English characters]]\n[[Category:Australian characters]]"
