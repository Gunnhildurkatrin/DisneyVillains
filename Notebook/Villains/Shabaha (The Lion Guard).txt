She is the bravest member of Vitani's [[Lion Guard]] after joining Simba's Pride.\n\n==Role in the series==\nShabaha is introduced when [[Vitani]] and her own Lion Guard of lionesses arrive to confront the hyenas and any other lions with the mark of evil as she tells her, along with [[Kasi]], [[Imara]], and [[Tazama]] to protect Vitani from them. Soon as the lionesses attack the Outlanders and [[Kion]]'s friends, [[Ono]] tells [[Anga]] that Vitani's Lion Guard has the same strength as Kion's Lion Guard. Ono tells the [[Mzingo's Parliament|vultures]] to distract the lionesses while he and Anga watch over Kion. Soon as Kion's Lion Guard prepares to fight back, [[Kiara]] and [[Kovu]] later arrive to which it is explained that all the [[Outsiders]] have joined Simba's Pride and [[Zira]] has completed her Circle of Life.\n\nThe next day, Kion's Lion Guard arrives at the [[Lair of the Lion Guard]] to know everything as changed only to find Vitani and her lionesses in here as both Lion Guards argue to know which is better. As both teams arrive at Mbali Fields, [[Azaad]] tries to rescue a zebra named [[Thurston]] who is stuck to which he is able to get himself out of a big hole to which both Lion Guards continue arguing. Thurston tells both groups to do it his way to which Ono tells Bunga to know that both Guards should compete to know whose Guard is the best to which the battle between two Lion Guards begins. During the battle of between Kion and Vitani's Lion Guards and the fourth position during battle is the bravest, Shabaha challenges against [[Bunga]] to know who is braver in a competition against him and Shabaha. Later during the battle between Kion and Vitani, Kion ultimately lets Vitani win by releasing the [[Roar of the Elders]], just as everyone in the Pride Lands (including Vitani's Lion Guard) looks at [[Askari]] who feels proud that Kion accomplished his task.\n\n==Relationships==\n\n===Friends/Acquaintances===\n====[[Vitani]] and her Lion Guard====\nShabaha is extremely good friends with Vitani, Kasi, Imara, and Tazama. All of them grew up together In the same pride in the Outlands after they were banished by Simba for their loyalty to Scar. They even fought along side each other during the battle with the Simba\u2019s Pride. After the fighting stopped and the prides merged, the four of them were easily recruited into Vitani's Lion Guard and since then, they have worked together to defend the Pride Lands.\n\n====[[Simba]] and [[Nala]]====\nLike all the other Outsiders, Shabaha used to hate Simba and Nala for Scar\u2019s death and banishing her and her pride mates to the Outlands for their loyalty to him. Simba likewise hated Shabaha and all the other Outsiders for their loyalty to his uncle. During the feud between the prides, she joined Zira in her ambush on Simba in an attempt to assassinate him and later fought against his pride in the final battle. However, after Kovu and Kiara intervened and convinced the prides to end the feud, Simba and Nala forgave Shabaha and allowed her and other Outsiders to rejoin his pride. Kasi in turn has forgiven Simba and Nala for her banishment and has now accepted them as her rulers. After being accepted back into the Pride Lands, Shabaha has since become the bravest member of the Lion Guard and helps defend Simba's rule. Like with Vitani and the other members of her guard, Simba and Nala have come to trust Shabaha in keeping the Pride Lands safe, showing that all past hatred they held for each other has vanished.\n\n====[[Kion]]====\nAt first, she and Kion were competitive to know which Guard is better until both Lion Guards finally get along after Kion let\u2019s go of the Roar.\n\n====[[Bunga]], [[Fuli]], [[Ono]], [[Beshte]], and [[Anga]]====\nLike Kion, the rest of his Lion Guard thought Shabaha and the other lionesses were enemies at first until Kiara told them that all the Outlanders joined Simba's Pride. Both Guards have a contest to see who is better.\n\n====All the other Pridelanders/Outlanders====\nShabaha is on good terms with all the other residents of the Pride Lands and the [[Outlands]].\n\n==Trivia==\n*Shabaha is the first bravest lioness to be a member of the Lion Guard.\n*\"Shabaha\" means \"target\" in Swahili.\n*Her catchphrase \"Bila hofu\" means \"Have no fear\" in Swahili.\n\n{{The Lion King}}\n[[Category:Lions]]\n[[Category:The Lion Guard characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:African characters]]\n[[Category:Hunters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
