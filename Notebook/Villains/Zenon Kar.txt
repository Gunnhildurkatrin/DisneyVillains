She is a teenage girl who lives with her family on a space station orbiting Earth. Zenon was born in 2036.\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early Life ===\nZenon Kar was born in 2036 somewhere on Earth to Astrid and Mark Kar. She lived on Earth until she was five years old. When Zenon was in Kindergarten she moved to a Space Stay Station up in Space.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century]]''===\nIn April of 2049, Zenon is 13 years old and has been living up in Space for the past 8 years ever since she was five years old. After getting into trouble with the space station's commander, [[Commander Plank|Edward Plank]], Zenon's parents punish her by grounding her to Earth to live with her single and childless Aunt Judy, who is afraid of space. After Aunt Judy picks up Zenon she takes her out to eat at a local restaurant where she meets her future classmates Andrew, Greg, [[Margie Hammond]] and Matt who are sitting at the table next to where she is sitting and eating with her Aunt Judy. Greg falls in love at first sight with Zenon. [[Margie Hammond]] goes up to Zenon and starts making fun of her outfit. Later that day right before Zenon goes to bed she asks her Aunt Judy about how come she has never gotten married or have any children of her own and Aunt Judy replies to Zenon\u2019s question and tells her that she is scared to take risks and to put herself out there. On Zenon\u2019s first day of school on Earth she ends up in the same class with Greg, [[Margie Hammond]] and Matt. Later that day at lunch Zenon is buying herself lunch at school then she realizes that she doesn\u2019t have any money then Greg helps Zenon out by paying for her lunch with his own money. On Earth, Zenon experiences trouble fitting in with other kids, but Greg had his eye on her. Zenon considered her space-station stories and slang weird to be avoided. [[Margie Hammond]] gives Zenon a hard time by making fun of her. Likewise, Zenon considers the children at her school woefully out of touch with pop culture. One day during Gym class the entire class is in line to practicing swimming in the school\u2019s pool. [[Margie Hammond]] who is standing right behind Zenon in line pushes Zenon into the pool on purpose. Greg jumps in to save Zenon from drowning and saves her life. To assuage her homesickness, Zenon often communicates with her best friend on the space station, [[Nebula Wade]], via a video phone tablet. Eventually, Zenon makes friends on earth with two boys, Andrew and Greg. Along the way, the kids learn to be more accepting of one another and to look past first impressions.\n\n[[File:Zenon and Nebula.jpg|thumb|left|Zenon and Nebula in 2049.]]\n\nDuring her time grounded on Earth, Zenon uncovers a plot masterminded by station bigwig Parker Wyndham to crash the computers of her space station home and thus the station itself, which will put everyone on it in danger. When Zenon tries to warn her parents of the danger, [[Commander Plank]], who sees all children as troublemakers, convinces Zenon's parents not to listen to her. He believes that her story is only a ploy to get her back onto the space station so that she can attend an upcoming concert by her idol [[Proto Zoa]], who is about to perform the world's first space concert. With the help of her friends Andrew and Greg, Zenon must find a way to save the space station and her family. Andrew creates a computer virus to counteract that deployed by Wyndham, and it is then up to Zenon to to get the disk to the station. Hoping to somehow sneak onto a space launch, Zenon goes to the launch yard, where [[Proto Zoa]] and his band are about to depart for their concert. Giving her new friends a farewell and Greg, their first \"unawkward\" kiss. In a lucky break, [[Proto Zoa]] recognizes that Zenon as the lucky fan that won his \"Dance with Me\" contest and takes her with his band, Mr. Wyndham, his assistant Lutz, and Aunt Judy on the launch to the station. Upon arrival, [[Commander Plank]] is shocked to see Zenon on the station but is smitten with Aunt Judy. After hearing Zenon's story, the commander still has trouble believing her, especially when Wyndham accuses her of sabotaging the station. Against all odds, Zenon manages to use the computer virus program that Andrew created to save the space station, and Wyndham and Lutz get arrested. Afterward, everyone enjoys the Microbe concert. Zenon on her tablet waves to Greg goodbye.\n\n===''[[Zenon: The Zequel]]''===\n[[File:Zenon Kar-The Zequel.jpg|thumb|Zenon in 2051]]Two years later in 2051,  Zenon is 15 years old and has been dating Greg for about two years. One day Greg breaks up with Zenon due to long-distance and later that day Zenon shows her friend Nebula how to play a new game and how to play it she inadvertently empties out Commander Planks Office and is assigned work detail in the Alien Patrol lab. Worse the space station is now under command of the military and General Hammond is assigned to command the station. [[Commander Plank]], very furious, comes out of his office and stops Zenon. Even worse, he assigns Zenon to look after his daughter who turns out to be her old nemesis, [[Margie Hammond|Margie]], who's demanding and threatens to have her dad kick Zenon and her family off the space station if Zenon doesn't obey her.\n\nZenon then discovers that her space station is being decommissioned due to damage from the plot by Wyndum and Lutz and sneaks down to Earth to try and stop it after getting a message from aliens that seem to want to meet with [[Proto Zoa]], but [[Margie Hammond|Margie]] wants to go too and sneaks down to Earth as well, but making it look like Zenon forced her to go with her. With the help of Aunt Judy, the girls track down [[Proto Zoa]] who has gone into hiding due to a dry spell and convince him to join them. Then Zenon, [[Margie Hammond|Margie]], Aunt Judy, [[Nebula Wade|Nebula]], Orion the Alien Patrol lab guy, [[Proto Zoa]], and her mother, Zenon goes to meet with the aliens near the moon. However, their ship runs out of fuel and they nearly crash to their deaths on the moon, but the aliens show up and rescue them. The aliens turn out to be friendly and communicating with Zenon telepathically, reveal that they have been lost in space for three years and need the ship's navigation charts to get home, thinking it impolite to just take them.\n\nAfter getting the charts, they then tow the ship back to the space station where General Hammond refuses to relent, saying the space station is too badly damaged and must be destroyed. Then his daughter [[Margie Hammond|Margie]] stands up to him for once, but it isn't enough until the aliens return and repair the space station as a thank-you gift for helping them. With the space station saved, [[Commander Plank]] and General Hammond are assigned to command it together then [[Commander Plank]] and Aunt Judy get married. At the wedding that [[Proto Zoa]] plays at, dedicating his new song to Zenon having been revitalized by the whole experience. It's also realized that the aliens were actually trying to communicate with Zenon, not [[Proto Zoa]], and were using the transmission of his old concert to do so. [[Margie Hammond|Margie]] convinces her father to let her stay and she and Zenon become friends while Zenon gets a possible love interest in Orion.\n\n===''[[Zenon: Z3]]''===\n[[File:Zenon Kar Z3.jpg|thumb|left|Zenon in 2054|184x184px]]\nThree years later in 2054, Zenon Kar is now 18 and competing to win the Galactic Teen Supreme contest and celebrate at the Moonstock Festival.

Sage is desperate to keep the Moon from being colonized and exploited and wants Zenon's help. One day Zenon visits her Aunt Judy and her Uncle Commander Plank on Earth who tells Zenon that she is getting a new cousin. At first Zenon thinks Aunt Judy is pregnant with her first child after being married to [[Commander Plank]] for three years. Then Aunt Judy tells Zenon that the baby has already been born which confuses Zenon. Then Aunt Judy and Uncle Edward tell Zenon that they are fostering a 10 year old girl named Dasha who is a lot like Zenon when she was younger. Dasha is obsessed with Zenon and really excited that her role model is going to be her new cousin. In the end, Zenon, Sage, Dasha and her friends Margie, Cassie, and Bronley team up to save the day. They evacuate everyone in [[Proto Zoa]]'s tour bus and try to remove the Moon Dome, with each taking a hover pod. However, the dome is too overweight to be lifted, until Commander Plank and Aunt Judy show up to help the group and were looking for Dasha. They're able to help lift the dome, which they let drift off into space. Selena then destroys the rest of the base and waves goodbye as the friends return to Earth. The wild weather caused by Selena has stopped.
