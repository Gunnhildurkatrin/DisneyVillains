She is a member of a band of dogs called the \"Singin' Strays\".\n\n==Personality==\nDixie is kind and beautiful, but gets into an argument with [[Cash]] after he fires her. However, she becomes nice to Cash once again, where they have a relationship and sings the final note of ''We're in Harmony''.\n\n==Role in the Film==\nDixie serves as the main antagonist in the sequel and is a vital member of [[Cash]]'s group, the \"Singin' Strays\". Toward the very beginning of the film, she gets into an argument with Cash after he fires her. She causes chaos after feeling she had been replaced by [[Copper]], whom she tricks into eating peanut butter before he got to sing. After Cash learns this, he tells her that she was through. After speaking to Zelda and later Tod, partly sharing how hurt she is with her fight with Cash, she finds information from [[Tod]] that proves useful to her cause. She then showed a naughty grin.\n\nAfter convincing Tod to help her, all destruction breaks loose at the fair, causing Copper to be fired from the gang. This causes turmoil in the gang, and they all end up quitting and going their separate ways. Feeling sorry for Copper, she tells him that Tod never meant any real harm and that he just wanted to remain his best friend.\n\nIn the end, Dixie and the rest of the gang are reunited and sing at the diner where the talent scout is, allowing them to get their big break performing at the Grand Ole Opry. The characters later listen to them on the radio.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" orientation=\"none\" widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\n\nSinging-Strays.jpg\nDixie Clasped Paws.jpg\nDivine Dixie.jpg\nDixie Close Up.jpg\nDixie 19.jpg\nDixie 18.jpg\nDixie 17.jpg\nDixie 11.jpg\nDixie 8.jpg\nDixie 7.jpg\nDixie 5.jpg\nDixie 3.jpg\nDixie 12.jpg\nDixie bored.jpg\nMiss-Dixie-dixie-from-the-fox-and-the-hound-2-41051256-1920-1080.jpg\nDixie melancholy.jpg\nFox-hound2-disneyscreencaps.com-7019.jpg\nDixie Dancing.jpg\nFox Hound 2 Screenshot 1759.jpg\nFox Hound 2 Screenshot 0529.jpg\nFox Hound 2 Screenshot 1725.jpg\nFox Hound 2 Screenshot 1396.jpg\nFox-hound2-disneyscreencaps.com-6940.jpg\nFox-hound2-disneyscreencaps.com-4517.jpg\nFox-hound2-disneyscreencaps.com-4527.jpg\nFox-hound2-disneyscreencaps.com-4539.jpg\nFox-hound2-disneyscreencaps.com-4559.jpg\nFox-hound2-disneyscreencaps.com-4347.jpg\nFox Hound 2 Screenshot 1361.jpg\nFox-hound2-disneyscreencaps com-4206.jpg\nFox-hound2-disneyscreencaps.com-7253.jpg\nFox-hound2-disneyscreencaps.com-7275.jpg\nFile:Good doggie no bone.png\n\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Fox and the Hound}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dixie}}\n[[es:Dixie]]\n[[ja:\u30c7\u30a3\u30ad\u30b7\u30fc]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:The Fox and the Hound characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
