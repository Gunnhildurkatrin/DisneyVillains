Bailey enrolls in Seven Seas High to go out and explore the world. However, Bailey couldn't get in the school; every student has a roommate who is the same gender as them (girls can only be roommates with girls), and everyone had a roommate. In order to get in, Bailey pretended to be a boy; she wore more loose-fitting clothing and a cap to cover her hair.\n\nBailey became [[Zack Martin|Zack]]'s roommate. However, she was disgusted by Zack's poor hygiene. But when Zack found out that Bailey was a girl (Bailey had taken off her cap), they become better friends. Zack also promised to keep Bailey's secret.\n\nWhen Bailey, Zack, [[Cody Martin|Cody]], [[Woody Fink|Woody]], and [[London Tipton|London]] were playing a video game, they heard an alarm. After reading about the different alarms for the boat, Cody found out that the alarm meant that the ship was sinking. In a panic, everyone tried to run out of the boat. They fall down into what they think is the ocean, but it is the hot tub. Everyone finds out that the alarm was just a drill. Bailey's cap fell into the hot tub, revealing that she was a girl.\n\nAfter everyone found out that she was a girl, [[Emma Tutweiller|Miss Tutweiller]] and [[Marion Moseby|Mr. Moseby]] say that Bailey can't attend Seven Seas High because every student had a roommate. However, London reveals that she doesn't (she bribed her old roommate to get off of the boat). Mr. Moseby says that Bailey can be London's roommate, but London refused. Angry that she couldn't have her own room and tired of living on the boat, London uses her helicopter to get off of the boat and run to Parrot Island.\n\nIn, \"Parrot Island\", Bailey felt like it was her fault that London left. Cody and Zack try to cheer her up, and Cody manages to make her laugh when he accidentally spills his smoothie on Mr. Moseby. But Bailey still feels bad and decides to go looking for London. She also brings her pet pig, Porkers, with her.\n\nWoody and Mr. Moseby go to look for London. When they don't return, Bailey, Cody and Zack look for them, only to be locked in jail with London, Mr. Moseby, and Woody. The man who works at the jail says that London's father, Mr. Tipton, cut down all of Parrot Island's trees, so he decided to lock up London and anyone who was friends with her.\n\nFortunately, Porkers manages to free them all when Bailey tells him how to get to the keys. Bailey and the others run out of the jail, and Bailey starts to go back to the boat until she stops to look at a photo of Parrot Island. Bailey sees how beautiful the island was and convinces London to help pay for the damages Mr. Tipton did on the island.\n\n===''[[The Suite Life Movie]]''===\nBailey has her and Cody's spring breaks all planned out, and is very excited about it. She finds out that Cody is going to a biology reserve, and will not be joining her. What she doesn't know, is that Cody has done this to get a scholarship for Yale, so that he can afford to go there and be with her.\n\n==Personality==\nShe is described as nice, smart, fun and loving for other people's feelings, which shows how sensitive she is. She is a sweet, down-to-earth girl, and somewhat strong, possibly from her farming life.\n\n==Appearance==\nBailey is a tall girl with apparent muscle built from her many years toiling at her family's farm. Her figure is slim, but not skinny. Bailey's straight hair is a dirty blonde color with natural blond highlights. Her outfits consist of mainly jeans and comfortable tops, though occasionally she sports a skirt or dress. She often wears cardigans, plaid patterns, capri pants, and other clothes. She mainly avoids a sequined and glitter-filled wardrobe. This is often criticized by London, who consistently shows her lack of affection for Bailey's clothes by calling her names.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Aside from speaking English, Bailey also speaks Japanese, French, and Italian.\n*She didn't like being confined in Kettlecorn, so when she was born, she crawled all the way to the county line and the civilians caught her (This was in the rough draft script of \"The Suite Life Sets Sail\").\n*She knows in the middle of Season 1 that Cody likes her.\n*She directed herself out of a Kettlecorn corn field using just the stars and the distant smell of cow patties.\n*In the episode \"Model Behavior\", at the party, it is shown that she was wearing a bikini under her outfit.\n*She owns a map of the world, and colors in countries where London insults her.\n*She owns Li'l Little (or Marcus Little) bedsheets (though she said they could also be Gary Coleman).\n*Her home has faced tons of disasters.\n*She once put on a play for the mice in her barn. It was good until her family's cat ate their star.\n*Bailey wears more modern clothes toward the end of Season 2.\n*She is usually not in trouble with Mr. Moseby.\n*She secretly thinks London is smart somewhere inside.\n*In \"I Brake for Whales\", Bailey adopted a baby whale, naming him Cody Blowholey after Cody.\n*She is the second character on the show to disguise themselves as the opposite gender.\n*In \"Rat Tale\", Zack states that Bailey has an overbite, to which Cody defensively replies by saying that she had to use chicken wire for braces because her family couldn't afford real ones.\n*In \"Computer Date\", Cody tells Arwin he will never be able find another girl to relate to on an emotional and intellectual level like he did with Bailey.\n*In \"Trouble in Tokyo\", Bailey tells Woody she is Kettlecorn's three-time Junior Miss Steer Wrestling champion.\n*In \"Prom Night\", Bailey wants to win prom queen because her mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, and Uncle Zeke (they don't like to talk about it) were all prom queen.\n*In \"Frozen\", Arturo Vitali created a fashion line called \"Hick Chic\" inspired by her clothes.\n*In \"Can You Dig It\", Bailey becomes possessed by the spirit of an evil Queen until she is saved by Cody.\n*She is originally from Kansas City.\n*In \"Can You Dig It?\" when Cody tries to revive her memory, he states she likes it when Cody tickles her left ear, and her favorite food is Chicken Pot Pie.\n*She has slippers that makes a ducks' quack, the same way [[Jessie Prescott]] has slippers that makes the sound of a cow's moo. Both characters are portrayed by Debby Ryan.\n\n==Non-Appearances==\nBailey has been absent for nine episodes of Season 1, 2 and 3 of ''The Suite Life on Deck''.\n\n'''Season 1:'''\n*The Swami and The Mommy\n*Mom and Dad on Deck\n*The Wrong Stuff\n*Splash & Trash\n*Cruisin' for a Bruisin'\n\n'''Season 2:'''\n*Any Given Fantasy\n\n'''Season 3:'''\n*My Oh Maya\n*Das Boots\n*Computer Date\n\n==Relationships==\n===Family===\n*'''Grammy Pickett''' (Linda Portel) \u2013 Bailey's grandmother.
