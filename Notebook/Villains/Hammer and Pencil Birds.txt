They are later seen crying for Alice when she sings \"[[Very Good Advice]]\". They are not seen again after that.\n\n==Trivia==\n*A pencil bird appeared in ''[[Donald in Mathmagic Land]]'', but it looks almost completely different. It was slightly taller than [[Donald Duck|Donald]]; it has a longer, less detailed pencil with a pink lead for ahead, a clear set square triangle for its entire body without a tail or wings (therefore making it flightless); and longer, thinner legs and toes without back toes. It challenged Donald to a game of Tic-tac-toe and won.\n**Pencil birds resembling this one appear as enemies in [[World of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck]]. \n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nPencilBirds.jpg\nPencilBirdsCrying.jpg\nTumblr ly9pbeWTJe1r3jmn6o1 1280.png\nDonald Duck in MathMagicLand - SchoolTube.jpg|A Pencil Bird as a Mathmagic land creature\n</gallery>\n\n{{Alice in Wonderland}}\n[[Category:Alice in Wonderland characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Birds]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Hybrids]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Alice In Wonderland objects]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
