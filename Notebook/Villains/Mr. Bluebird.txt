It's the truth, it's actual... Everything is satisfactual...|One of the lines from the musical number \"[[Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah]]\" referencing Mr. Bluebird}}\n\n'''Mr. Bluebird''' is a minor character in the [[1946]] film, ''[[Song of the South]]''. He is sporadically referenced in the song \"[[Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah]]\", appearing throughout the film.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Song of the South]]''===\nDuring the musical number \"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah\", Mr. Bluebird appears as a gag character throughout the animated sequence. He then takes Uncle Remus to a gopher burrow where three female gophers join in chorus alongside three hummingbirds and later during the bee verse. He later appears at the end of the film joining alongside animated characters following the entire group skipping away during the reprise of \"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah\".\n\n===Other Appearances===\nMr. Bluebird featured prominently in the [[Splash Mountain]] attractions at the Disney Parks. Unlike in the film where his dialogues only consist of chirps and whistles, Mr. Bluebird actually speaks in the ride.\n\nHe also appeared in the ''[[House of Mouse]]'' episode, \"[[Pete's One-Man Show|Pete's One Man Show]]\", making a brief cameo appearance during [[Boom-Da-Boom]], where he sat on [[Pete|Pete's]] shoulder and got flicked away by him. In addition, he appears briefly, along with several other ''Song of the South'' characters, in the ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'' short, \"[[Computer.don]]\".\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"185\">\nDgsm2.jpg\nSong of the South - Mr. Bluebird.jpg\nMr Bluebird Snackin Place.jpg|Mr. Bluebird on the marquee for a Disneyland snack cart.\nMister Bluebird's on Pete\u2019s shoulder.png\nMister Bluebird cameo MMW.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bluebird}}\n\n{{Song of the South}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Song of the South characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Splash Mountain characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse Works characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters in live-action films]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Passeriformes]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
