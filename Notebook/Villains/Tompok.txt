He is a civet who lives in the tropical forest alongside neighboring animals the Lion Guard encounters.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nTompok shows a friendly personality, though a little carefree. However, he can be frightened due to Mama Binturong's strict rule about Tuliza, making him afraid of saying the word. Despite his fear, he even calmed down where he gained courage to assist the Lion Guard when necessary by calming himself.\n\n==Role in the series==\n===\"[[Mama Binturong]]\"===\nTompok first appears in the \"[[You Best Not Mess With Mama]]\" musical number where [[Smun]] and the porcupines chase him up a tree. He mocks them and laughs until Mama Binturong appears behind him.\n\nHe appears again eating berries as the Lion Guard walks by. Bunga by sneaks up behind Tompok and yells, \"Tuliza\", making the civet panic and accidentally tumble into a raging river. Anga saves him, but he screams because she's an eagle whom the civet thinks she's trying to eat him. Anga carries him back to safety, but when [[Beshte]] asks him about tuliza, he gets scared and runs away. Later while talking to Bambun about where to find Makini's staff, the mongoose tells the Guard to talk to the civet. Upon arriving, the Guard talks to Tompok about the missing staff to which he tells them to talk to the mouse deer who would know about the staff to which the mouse deer explains to talk to Seisou in the cave who knows about the missing staff. Tompok's further fate is unknown.\n\n==Trivia==\n*He is the second civet to appear in the ''Lion King'' franchise.\n*\"Tompok\" means \"spots\" in Malay.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://lionking.fandom.com/wiki/Tompok Tompok] on [http://lionking.fandom.com/wiki Lion King Wiki]\n\n{{The Lion King}}\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n\n[[Category:The Lion Guard characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Asian characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
