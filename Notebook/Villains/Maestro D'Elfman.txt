He was considerably close with Lord [[Henry Mystic]] and appeared to have assisted him with his music-room in Mystic Manor.\n\n===Development History===\nMaestro D'Elfman is a tribute to [[Danny Elfman]], who composed the soundtrack to (among other things) Mystic Manor and the soundtrack to the [[Nightmare Before Christmas]], which was adapted for [[Haunted Mansion Holiday]].\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===Mystic Manor===\nMaestro D'Elfman appears in portrait form in Mystic Manor, showing him situated within Mystic's music room. Later in the attraction, guests traverse this music room following its possession from the [[Balinese Music Box]].\n\n==Trivia==\n*Despite being one of the first S.E.A. members introduced and actually visualized, D'Elfman probably contains the least amount of attraction references of any society member.\n*For unknown reasons, the maestro was not present for the S.E.A. meeting of 1899.\n**It is possible he was simply unavailable.\n**Another possibility is that he died prior to this meeting.\n**It is also possible that he was simply not a member at the time of the meeting in 1899.\n\n{{Society of Explorers and Adventurers}}\n{{The Haunted Mansion}}\n[[Category:The Haunted Mansion characters]]\n[[Category:S.E.A. characters]]\n[[Category:Society of Explorers and Adventurers]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]"
