Ever since her first glow, all she\u2019s really wanted to be is a glittering pop star! Leona shines when she\u2019s in the spotlight, but she sometimes forgets that it isn\u2019t always about her all the time. She\u2019s ready to show her full star potential at Starling Academy and breaking away from her routine existence in the lifeless town of Flairfield.''\n===Personality===\nDescribing Leona's personality, she is confident, hardworking, generous, open-minded, optimistic, caring, and a strong leader. While on the other hand on her personality, she can be sassy, vain, opinionated, selfish, bossy, dramatic, overly-cautious, and stubborn and is prone to losing her temper. Leona is also shown to be artistically creative as seen in the episode ''Paint By Numbers''.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nShe is the lead singer in the Star Darlings band.\n\n== Appearance ==\nLeona\u2019s theme color is yellow. She is a teenage girl with dark skin, yellow lips and eyes, and curly blonde hair styled in a messy afro. Her outfit consists of a yellow off the shoulder top over a yellow tank top, a brown belt with star and circle shaped buckles, yellow leggings with star designs, and matching yellow boots. Her accessory is her star-charmed cuff.\n\nOn Earth, Leona\u2019s appearance changes to look like a normal human. Her hair color changes to black with only a streak of yellow. Her skin also loses its sparkle and her outfit changes to look more human. The only item that remains the same is her star-charmed cuff.\n\n==Trivia==\n* Leona is named after [[wikipedia:Leo (astrology)|Leo]] (\u264c), the fifth of the twelve astrological signs of the zodiac, which means the lion.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nDisney's Star Darlings - Leona's Unlucky Mission - Book Cover.jpg\nStar-Darlings-post.jpg\nStar Darlings 01.jpeg\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Star Darlings}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Star Darlings characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]"
