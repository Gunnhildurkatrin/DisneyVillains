Clover is sweet and the ultimate team player. Clover loves writing songs and DJing, so she\u2019s the perfect addition to feature in the Star Darlings\u2019 band.''\n===Personality===\nClover is considered creative, especially when she\u2019s making music. She is known to be loyal, patient, willpower, responsible, dependable, and contains great self-discipline.\n\nHowever, on her bad side, she can be rigid and doesn\u2019t like taking hard risks or challenges. She can be lonely to those she doesn\u2019t know and isn\u2018t well-read. Sometimes Clover can be a wisecracker.\n\n== Appearance ==\nClover\u2019s theme color is violet. She is a teenage girl with light skin, violet eyes, lips, a thin slot between her front teeth, and hair braided into a backbun. Her outfit consists of a violet top hat, a jacket with a sparkly purple shirt underneath, violet skirt, leggings with star patterns, and fuchsia boots. Her accessories consists of her purple headphones and her star-charmed barrette.\n\nOn Earth, Clover\u2019s appearance changes to look like a normal human.
