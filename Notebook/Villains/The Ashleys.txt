They are always uttering the phrase \"Scandalous\" and they all have a little sister Brittany and a little brother Tyler.\n\nThey are recurring antagonists towards The Recess Gang, especially towards [[Spinelli]], due to her first name being Ashley and her refusal to join them.\n\nThey have been known to have ideas that can do damage to the playground itself, while they are benefited, for example, a rating system that caused catastrophic damage to the playground's balance of nature, until The Recess Gang managed to fix it. They have also been known to be rather cruel to unpopular kids such as [[Gus]], targeting them in \"[[The Ratings Game]]\" and specifically picking on Gus in \"[[Jinxed]].\"\n\nThey have a tradition called Purple Day where they wear only purple clothes to celebrate the day they first formed their clique. [[Ashley Armbruster|Ashley A.]] forgot this at one point, and for this, she was kicked out temporarily and she was forced to hang out with [[Gretchen Grundler|Gretchen]] for some time.\n\n==Members==\n*[[Ashley Armbruster]] (Ashley A.) (Ringleader)\n*[[Ashley Boulet]] (Ashley B.) (Second-in-command)\n*[[Ashley Quinlan]] (Ashley Q.)\n*[[Ashley Tomassian]] (Ashley T.)\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink|The Ashleys}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Despite the events of \"[[First Name Ashley]]\", it is hinted in a few later episodes, most notably \"[[The Beauty Contest]]\" and \"[[That Stinking Feeling (Recess)|That Stinking Feeling]]\", that the Ashleys still desire to get Spinelli to be part of their clique.\n*In the episode where [[Partners in Crime|Randall and Menlo team up]], it was revealed by Menlo that at least one of the Ashleys' fathers went to a state university, and inquired which of them it was. Based on the fact that he got them to serve himself and Randall during their rise to power as defacto rulers via this information, it's implied that the Ashleys did not want any knowledge of their fathers having attended a state university to get out.\n* The Ashleys appear to be based on the Heathers from the 1989 film ''Heathers'', a film about a school's social hierarchy run by a group of girls, all with the same first name.\n\n==External links==\n*[[w:c:recess:The Ashleys|The Ashleys on Recess Wiki]]\n\n{{Recess}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ashleys, The}}\n[[Category:Recess characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Cheerleaders]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
