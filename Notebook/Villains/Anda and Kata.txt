She is a lighter brown than Kata, and at the end of the movie, Anda becomes Rutt's mate while Kata is Tuke's mate.\n\nAt first, they are not interested in Rutt and Tuke and ridicule their foolish attempts to attract them, most notably when Kenai pretends to be a \"big, hungry, scary, bear\". Rutt and Tuke even end up getting a female buffalo after them thinking it to be a moosette.\n\nAnda and Kata are not interested in Rutt and Tuke until Koda runs to them, saying he's playing with his friends, and Rutt and Tuke ask them where he is. Finding this adorable, the moosettes are a bit more attracted to the moose, but when Rutt bellows out awkward poetry, the moosettes quickly settle for Tuke, but after seeing Rutt's sensitivity, settle for him. But, eventually, Anda mates with Rutt while Kata gets Tuke.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nBear2-disneyscreencaps com-7105.jpg\nBrother Bear 2 Promo.jpg\nBrother Bear 2 Promo 2.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Brother Bear}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric animals]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric characters]]\n[[Category:Brother Bear characters]]\n[[Category:Moose]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Canadian characters]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]"
