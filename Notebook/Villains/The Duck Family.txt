"[[File:Van Horn tree.JPG|thumb|250px|Donald Duck family portrait by [[William Van Horn]].]]\nThe '''Duck family''' is the term used for the relatives of [[Donald Duck]]. Throughout the years, the relationships of [[Donald Duck|Donald]]'s relatives have been revised and modified by authors, although there are some consistent relationships directly with Donald's closest relatives. This group is also related to the '''Von Drake''', '''Coot''', '''Goose''', '''Gander''', and the '''McDuck''' families.\n\n==Background==\nThe Duck family's roots date back to 1618 when Captain Thirtyville, his nephew Donald Ducktargen and ''his'' nephews Houie, Louie, and Dewie (the Three Cadet Musketeers), moved to America to establish their clan.\n\n==Members==\n===Boatsman Pintail===\n'''Boatsman Pintail''' first appeared in [[Carl Barks]]' \"Back to Long Ago\" in ''Uncle Scrooge #16''. According to the story, he and his superior, Matey McDuck buried a treasure of potatoes for Captain Loyal Hawk of The Falcon Rover. He drowned three days later and was later reborn as Donald Duck. His debut story does not mention any genealogical relation to Donald, and he is simply referred to by Matey McDuck as \"Bos'n Pintail\", with \"Pintail\" presumably being intended by Barks as the character's last name.\n\n===Humperdink \"Grandpa\" Duck===\n{{Main|Humperdink Duck}}\n\n===Elviry/Abigail \"Grandma\" Duck===\n{{Main|Grandma Duck}}\n\n===Quackmore Duck===\n{{Main|Quackmore Duck}}\n\n===Daphne Duck===\n{{Main|Daphne Duck}}\n\n===Eider Duck===\n[[File:Comic Donald boys and falcon.JPG|thumb|250px|The present Eider sends to his nephews in Duckburg in ''The Fighting Falcon''.]]\n'''Eider Duck''', also known as '''Uncle Eider''', is [[Donald Duck]]'s uncle and [[Fethry Duck]]'s father, who was first mentioned in August [[1944]] in the [[Carl Barks]] story ''The Fighting Falcon'' (''[[Walt Disney's Comics and Stories]]'' #47). In this story, Donald receives a falcon called Farragut as a present from his uncle Eider who does not live in [[Duckburg]]. Farragut arrives inside a big box brought to Donald's house by an expressman.\n\nBarks never mentioned Eider again in any of his stories. Donald did briefly mention Fethry's father in an unnamed Disney comic from [[1969]], written by [[Dick Kinney]] and drawn by Al Hubbard.<ref>[[:File:Comic Fethry Duck.png|File:Comic Fethry Duck.png]]</ref> Eider made his first visual comic appearance in ''[[The Empire-Builder from Calisota]]'', where he was shown working at the Duck family farm. He later made a brief cameo appearance as a background character in Duckburg in the crossover comic ''[[Dangerous Currency]]''.<ref>''[[Dangerous Currency]]''</ref>\n\nEider was also shown on a portrait on Don Rosa's ''Duck Family Tree'', as the husband of Lulubelle Loon and the father of [[Whitewater Duck|Whitewater]] and Fethry Duck. Given the fact that, in ''[[Dugan's Birth|O Nascimento Do Biquinho]]'', Fethry mentions that he has got a sister, Eider and Lulubelle would have at least one daughter, making him the grandfather of Fethry's nephew Dugan.\n\n===Lulubelle Loon===\n'''Lulubelle Loon''' is the wife of Eider Duck and the mother of Fethry Duck.\n\n===Donald Duck===\n{{Main|Donald Duck}}\n\n===Della Duck===\n{{Main|Della Duck}}\n\n===Fethry Duck===\n{{Main|Fethry Duck}}\n\n===Whitewater Duck===\n{{Main|Whitewater Duck}}\n\n===Huey, Dewey and Louie Duck===\n{{Main|Huey, Dewey, and Louie}}\n\n===Moby Duck===\n{{Main|Moby Duck}}\n\n===Dugan Duck===\n[[File:1197059-846873 028e3ebf93 super.png|thumb|300px]]\n'''Dugan Duck''' is the 4-year-old nephew of Donald Duck's cousin Fethry Duck. He is a big troublemaker and even gets his chaotic uncle into problems.\n\n[[Dugan's Birth|The first story featuring Dugan]] begins when Fethry and his girlfriend Gloria are checking the Duck family tree, and one branch has no name, just the drawing of an egg. Fethry explains that when his sister was about to get her first egg from the stork, a hand came from the egg and knocked the stork out, and when they searched, only found the stork and the broken eggshell. Fethry and Gloria travel to the jungle where the egg was lost the first time, and find Dugan who was raised by porcupines. They are all trapped by a tribe and sacrificed to a volcano, but it turns that it is the joker tribe of Quiuanagucha and the ducks were not in real danger, with a net awaiting them before reaching the lava. Fethry takes Dugan back to the civilization.\n\nAfter moving back to Duckburg, Dugan begins wearing clothes similar to his uncle's ones and appears in several comic stories. Dugan is younger than Huey, Dewey, and Louie, and considered too young to join the Junior Woodchucks and has been refused membership.\n\nWhile Dugan has a low opinion about his uncle Fethry, he admires the Red Bat (Fethry's superhero identity). Overall he causes a lot of trouble to his uncle and makes even him upset.\n\nAlthough various colorists (especially ones coloring Dugan's more recent appearances) have depicted Dugan with white feathers (like most Disney ducks), Dugan has often been portrayed having yellow feathers.\n\n===Upsy Duck===\n'''Upsy Duck''' is Donald's uncle from \"Mastering The Matterhorn\". In the story, one of Donald's triplet nephews mentions that Upsy was their great uncle. According to this story, he gained the nickname \"Upsy\" because he was a great mountain climber. Donald clearly refers to Upsy Duck as his uncle on the fourth page of this comic story. He says in the first panel of this page, \"But '''Uncle Upsy''' didn't give up easily!\"\n\n===Sheriff Dan Duck===\n'''Sheriff Dan Duck''' (aka Cousin Dan) is an old cousin of Donald who happens to be sheriff of a Western town called ''Bent Spur Gulch''. Dan originally has dark grey thick eyebrows, a long dark grey mustache and long dark grey hair on the left and right sides of his head. He is generally shown holding a crutch.\n\n===Dudly D. Duck===\n'''Dudly D. Duck''' is a cousin of Donald who appears in the comic story \"Why All the Crabby Ducks\" by Vic Lockman and Mike Arens. He is a flopped architect and inventor who was responsible for the construction of the \"Jog Tunnel\", which annoys the citizens of Duckburg because it really has a jog in it, and for the bad planning of Duckburg's streets. Therefore, Dudly became very unpopular and was forced to live isolated in a lonely street, including his name was forgotten until the day that Donald discovers who planned the \"Jog Tunnel\", and then his girlfriend Daisy Duck reveals who is Dudly Duck through the newspaper where she works as a reporter. A reporter rival of Daisy ends up discovering that Dudly is related to Donald, who in turn becomes unpopular too.\n\n===Nancy Duck===\n'''Nancy Duck''' is a female cousin on the father's side of Donald. She appears in the comic story \"A Likely Story\" by [[Bob Gregory]], where [[Daisy Duck]] thinks that Donald is having a romantic meeting with a glamorous and beautiful actress who is also called Nancy Duck in his own home. Like Upsy and Dim-Witty Duck, Nancy also tends to keep her eyes half-opened.\n\n=== Hackney McWebfoot ===\nDonald's second-cousin, who is renowned for his works in the comic Pop Cop, despite having grown weary of writing for the character. Upon visiting his relatives in Duckburg, Hackney is inspired to write characters based off of Donald, Gladstone, Gyro Gearloose, and Scrooge - only to be told that such wild and outlandish stories would never attract an audience.\n\n===Ludwig Von Drake===\n{{Main|Ludwig Von Drake}}\n\n==Clan McDuck==\n===Scrooge McDuck===\n{{Main|Scrooge McDuck}}\n\n===Douglas McDuck===\n{{Main|Douglas McDuck}}\n\n===Fergus McDuck===\n{{Main|Fergus McDuck}}\n\n===Gideon McDuck===\n{{Main|Gideon McDuck}}\n\n===Rumpus McFowl===\n{{Main|Rumpus McFowl}}\n\n===Hortense McDuck===\n{{Main|Hortense McDuck}}\n\n===Matilda McDuck===\n{{Main|Matilda McDuck}}\n\n===Downy McDuck===\n{{Main|Downy McDuck}}\n\n===Pothole McDuck===\n{{Main|Pothole McDuck}}\n\n===Titus McDuck===\n{{Main|Titus McDuck}}\n\n===Sir Eider McDuck===\n'''Sir Eider McDuck''' is mentioned in the story \"The Old Castle's Secret\" by Carl Barks and later appeared in Don Rosa's Duck Family Tree and The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck.\n\nSir Eider was born in Scotland in 880. Later in his life, he became the leader of The Clan McDuck. In 946, the castle was under siege by Anglo-Saxons, raiders who did not care about the treaty that King Edmund I of England and King Malcolm I of Scotland signed in 945. Sir Eider did not supply arrows for his men (because they were expensive) and paid them (collectively) only 30 pieces of copper an hour. His under-paid men abandoned their lord to save their lives, and Sir Eider died fighting the raiders alone.\n\nSir Eider was buried in the family cemetery, and his armor was placed in one of the castle's hallways.\n\n===Sir Quackly McDuck===\n'''Sir Quackly McDuck''' is a character from the ''Donald Duck'' comics. He is Scrooge McDuck's Scottish ancestor and was first mentioned in the story ''The Old Castle's Secret'', by Carl Barks. Here, Scrooge and his nephews go on a hunt for Quackly's presumed treasure, with which he accidentally trapped himself inside the walls while trying to protect it. Sir Quackly became a legend among the McDucks, who claimed that his ghost protected the treasure and the castle. The story's villain Diamond Dick disguises himself as Quackly's ghost to scare Scrooge McDuck away. In the end, however, Sir Quackly's remains and the treasure chest are found by Scrooge and his nephews.\n\nQuackly later appeared in Don Rosa's Donald Duck family tree poster. He also appears as a ghost in ''The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck''. He made a cameo appearance in ''The Haunted Houses'', (''Walt Disney's Comics and Stories'' 661) dancing among ghosts from other previous ''Donald Duck'' and ''Mickey Mouse'' comics.\n\n===Sir Stuft McDuck===\n'''Sir Stuft McDuck''' was a successful chief of Clan McDuck who oversaw a period of prosperity.\n\n===Sir Roast McDuck===\n[[File:Sirroast.JPG|thumb|220px|Sir Roast's armor (suited to his rotund figure), as it appears in ''The Old Castle's Secret'' (1948).]]\n'''Sir Roast McDuck''' is a character from the ''Donald Duck'' and ''Uncle Scrooge'' comics.\n\nThe son of Stuft McDuck, Roast was clan chief at a point when Clan McDuck was one of the richest clans in Scotland. However, he was known for patriotic imprudence and gluttony which led the clan on the brink of collapse and even his own death. In 1189, Roast offered much of the clan's wealth to King William, leading to financial ruin for the clan. In 1205, he raided the king's pantry and died from over-eating. In [[Castle McDuck]], Roast's suit of armor holds a knife and fork in its hands.\n\nRoast was first mentioned in Carl Barks' \"[[The Old Castle's Secret]]. He made his first appearance in \"[[The New Laird of Castle McDuck]]\".\n\n===Sir Swamphole McDuck===\n'''Sir Swamphole McDuck''' is a character from the ''Donald Duck'' comic \"[[The Old Castle's Secret]]\".\n\nSwamphole was born in 1190 as the son of Roast McDuck, whom he succeeded as chief of the clan. Being chief also meant inheriting the clan's financial problems, thus in 1220, Swamphole sealed the dungeon of Castle McDuck, slated to decrease maintenance costs; in truth, this was to conceal a treasure.<ref>\"[[The Old Castle's Other Secret or A Letter From Home]]\"</ref> He also created secret passageways in the castle leading to the dungeons. After his death in 1260, Swamphole's skeleton was not buried in the clan cemetery but placed inside his suit of armor in Castle McDuck.\n\n===Sir Simon McDuck===\n'''Sir Simon McDuck''' is a McDuck who was the treasurer of the {{WikipediaLink|Knights Templar}}. Before his death, he hid the knights' treasure beneath McDuck Castle.\n\nHe is mentioned in \"[[The Old Castle's Other Secret or A Letter From Home]]\".\n\n===Sir Donald McDuck===\n'''Sir Donald McDuck''', nicknamed '''Black Donald''', is a Scottish ancestor of Scrooge known for his horrible temper, hence his nickname. He was said to have invented golf, hammer throw, and caber toss in 1440. However, it was because of his temper while playing golf that James II of Scotland outlawed the sport. His descendant and namesake, Donald Duck, has a temper reminiscent of Black Donald.\n\nBlack Donald was first mentioned in Don Rosa's ''The History of the Clan McDuck''. He was also mentioned in the [[2017]] ''[[DuckTales (2017 series)|DuckTales]]'' episode \"[[The Missing Links of Moorshire!]]\".\n\n=== Sir Murdoch McDuck ===\n\n[[File:Sir Murdoch McDuck.png|thumb|220x220px]]\n'''Sir Murdoch McDuck''' or '''Sir Murdoch MacDuich''' was the last person in the Dark Ages MacDuich Clan, he was the one who changed the family surname to McDuck. He was born in the 11th century. In 1066, when the Normans invaded England, the English Army came to him to sign a contract to supply them longbows because he owned the patent. However, the contact did not state that he would charge extra for arrows. He ironically died from a shot from a longbow.\n\nSir Murdoch McDuck was created for the book \"[[The History of the Clan McDuck]]\" but is mentioned in the [[DuckTales (2017 series)|2017 DuckTales]] episode \"[[The Secret(s) of Castle McDuck!]].\n\n==Coot Kin==\nThe surname \"Coot\" had been used on several ducks by various artists, usually for characters who were relatives of Donald Duck but were not part of the Duck family or the Clan McDuck. When Don Rosa created his Duck Family Tree in 1993, he included the Coots used by Carl Barks and himself as Grandma Duck's family and descendants of Cornelius Coot. It was Rosa's idea to use Coot as Grandma's maiden name and to have Cornelius Coot as an ancestor of Donald, and it, therefore, contradicts Barks's work.\n\n===Cornelius Coot===\n{{Main|Cornelius Coot}}\n\n===Clinton Coot===\n{{Main|Clinton Coot}}\n\n===Gertrude Gadwall===\n'''Gertrude Gadwall''' is the wife of Clinton Coot, mother of Elvira Coot (also known as [[Grandma Duck]]) and Casey Coot, and grandmother of Quackmore Duck, [[Daphne Duck]], Eider Duck, Cuthbert Coot and Fanny Coot, and their descendants.\n\n=== Clarence Coot ===\nPresented as a brother of Grandma Duck in the Shanghai Disneyland mural \"Donald's Fore-feathers\", Clarence who worked as a bicycle mechanic in the late 1800s and  would eventually come to marry Rosabella Paperino, making him Donald's paternal great-uncle.\n\n===Casey Coot===\n'''Casey Coot''' is an anthropomorphic Coot, who was one of Scrooge McDuck fellow prospectors during Scrooge's Gold Rush days. He was introduced in ''Last Sled to Dawson'', (''[[Uncle Scrooge Adventures]]'' #5).\n\nCasey is introduced as an unsuccessful gold prospector and friend of Scrooge McDuck during his years as a prospector during the Klondike Gold Rush. In need of money, he sold to the significantly more successful Scrooge McDuck his share in Duckburg, Calisota, USA. His share included \"Killmule Hill\" which renamed to \"Killmotor Hill\" comprises the land where Scrooge's money bin stands on. He later appeared in ''[[The King of the Klondike]]'' and ''Hearts of the Yukon''. According to ''[[The Invader of Fort Duckburg]]'', Grandma Duck is his sister.\n\nIn Don Rosa's Duck Family Tree he is featured as a grandson of Cornelius Coot, a son of Clinton Coot and his wife Gertrude Gadwall. According to the tree, he was married to Gretchen Grebe and they had at least two kids named Fanny Coot and Cuthbert Coot.\n\n===Gretchen Grebe===\n'''Gretchen Grebe''' is the wife of Casey Coot, mother of Cuthbert Coot and Fanny Coot and grandmother of [[Gus Goose]].\n\n===Fanny Coot===\n{{Main|Fanny the Goose}}\n\n===Cuthbert Coot===\n{{Main|Cuthbert Coot}}\n\n===Kildare Coot===\n'''Kildare Coot''' was introduced by artist [[Romano Scarpa]] as a highly eccentric fourth cousin of [[Donald Duck]] in the story \"Sgrizzo, il papero pi\u00f9 balzano del mondo\" (roughly translated as \"Kildare Coot, the weirdest duck in the world\"), first published on October 25, 1964. Though his exact relationship to Donald remains uncertain his last name suggests he belongs to the Coot Kin and that he is related to Donald through Elvira Coot, Donald's paternal grandmother. Curiously, Kildare usually treats [[Gideon McDuck]], Scrooge's younger brother, as his uncle. Kildare and his fellow '''Andy Ascott''' (original Italian name) appear as reporters of Gideon's newspaper, ''The County Conscience'', in some Italian stories.\n\n==Gander family==\n===Goosetave Gander===\n'''Goosetave Gander''' is [[Gladstone Gander]]'s late father, who was originally to be married to [[Matilda McDuck]], who was Scrooge's sister. However, this has since been retconned, and Goosetave is depicted as being married to Daphne Duck, sister to Quackmore Duck, with Matilda being suggested to be Gladstone's adoptive mother following the death of his parents. \"Us ''Ganders'' have never sunk low enough to associate with you ''Ducks''!\", exclaimed Gladstone to Donald in \"Race to the South Seas\" by Carl Barks, suggesting that there is a mutual antipathy between his father's family and his mother's one.\n\n===Gladstone Gander===\n{{Main|Gladstone Gander}}\n\n=== Oscar Gander ===\nOriginating from Italian comics, Oscar Gander is depicted as being the nephew of Scrooge McDuck, further supporting that the children of Goosetave had been adopted by Matilda. Much like Gladstone, Oscar was considered to be an attractor of bad luck, which affects both himself and those around him. Essentially the opposite of Gladstone in terms of personality, Oscar was portrayed as being kind and honest.\n\n=== Shamrock Gander ===\nShamrock is the nephew of Gladstone Gander, who has the same level of good luck that his uncle does. In some depictions, Shamrock competes against Huey, Dewey, and Louie, similar to how Gladstone competes with Donald.\n\n==Goose family==\n===Luke the Goose===\n{{Main|Luke the Goose}}\n\n===Gus Goose===\n{{Main|Gus Goose}}\n\n=== Drusilla Duck (n\u00e9e Goose) ===\nDrusilla Duck is the sister of Luke the Goose, thus making her Gus Goose's paternal aunt. Additionally, Drusilla is the aunt of Daisy Duck, and given her surname, it is likely that she married one of Daisy's uncles. Drusilla is depicted as being very kind and wealthy, having offered Daisy a cruise for her diligent studies in poetry.\n\n== Paperino family ==\nDepicted in the \"Donald's Fore-feathers\" mural in Shanghai Disneyland, the Paperinos are the Italian in-laws to the Coot Kin via Clarence Coot and Rosabella Paperino, with their ancestry being deeply rooted in important events throughout history.\n\n'''Clarence Coot''' is the sibling of Elvira Duck - thereby the great uncle of Donald Duck - operating as a bicycle mechanic at the end of the 19th Century, when he met '''Rosabella Paperino''', who had emigrated to America fro Italy via Ellis Island, thereby connecting the Coot kin to the Paperino family. The father of Rosabella was '''Garibaldi Paperino''', and his wife, '''Carina Barone'''. Around 89 years prior, Garibaldi's ancestor, '''Pasquato Paperino''', an olive oil tycoon, married '''Giovanna Bacigalupe''', and 170 years before that, '''Galileo Paperino''' - clearly inspired by Galileo Galilei -renowned for his attempts to prove that the world revolved around the moon, married '''Bianca Capodevin'''. Another three-quarters of a century prior, the ancestor of Galileo Paperino, '''Leonardo Da Paperino''' - another character inspired by an Italian historical figure, this time being Leonardo da Vinci - a renowned inventor and artist, married the subject of his famous painting, '''Mona Ducka'''. Just a generation prior to Leonardo Da Paperino, '''Luigi Paperino''' had managed to miss Columbus' journey to the new world because he'd overslept, earning the ire of his wife '''Cosma Featherina''', as the two remained in Italy. Similarly, a generation before that, '''\"Peking\" Paolo Paperino''' sailed with Admiral Zheng He aboard the Discovery, and '''Donatello Paperino''' -  inspired by the famed sculptor, Donatello - who married '''Margarita di Franco''' - similarly named after Margaret of Valois, queen of France. Presumed grandfather of Donatello, '''Marco Paperino''' - inspired by Marco Polo - was famed for having introduced gelato to the west from China, and married one '''Lucretia Mcduckhi'''. Going back 370 years, Marco Paperino's lineage can be traced through Petronus Paperino, who had been a Byzantine tax collector and who'd married one '''Theodora Eirenikes, the Peaceful'''. Further investigation would bring one to discover that the wife of Clarence Coot can trace her lineage all the way back to 70 AD, in the form of '''Donaldus Anas''' - Centurion of Rome - who had been married to '''Octavia the Younger''', who shares her name with the real historical counterpart of the Roman Empre.\n\n==Other Ducks==\nWhile they share the last name as the Duck family, these characters are not related to Donald. These characters include the following.\n\n===Daisy Duck===\n{{Main|Daisy Duck}}\n\n===April, May, and June Duck===\n{{Main|April, May, and June}}\n\n===Dickie Duck===\n{{Main|Dickie Duck}}\n\n===Belle Duck===\n{{Main|Belle Duck}}\n\n===Dim-Witty Duck===\n{{Main|Dim-Witty Duck}}\n\n===Dexter Duck===\n'''Dexter Duck''' is an anthropomorphic duck who, like [[Gladstone Gander]], contests with [[Donald Duck]] to get Daisy Duck's attention. Dexter Duck appeared in one only story thus far, \"Double Date\" by [[Tony Strobl]], where he plays dirty to beat Donald and conquer Daisy. It's not suggested that Dexter is related to Donald in this story, despite they share the same surname.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nDuck Family.png\nDutch Duck Family tree.jpg|Detail of the family tree including the three cousins Donald, Gladstone and Fethry\nTreepinset.jpg\nTreesgdp.jpg|Italian comic artist Giovan Battista Carpi's family tree\nDuck family Carpi.jpg|Carpi's alternate version\nAlbero genealogico.jpg|Duck Family tree realized by Don Rosa and one of the most famous ones\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Donald Duck is the first descendant of the three main Duck families (Duck, Coot and McDuck), a trait shared only by [[Della Duck|his sister]] and [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|his nephews]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{WP|Duck family (Disney)}}\n\n{{Mickey Mouse & Friends}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Duck Family}}\n[[sr-el:Porodica Patak]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Uncles]]\n[[Category:Grandparents]]\n[[Category:Character lists]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Duck Family]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
