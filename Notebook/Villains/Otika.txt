"{{Infobox character\n|image = Otika_(1080p).png\n|films = ''[[Fantasia]]'' (censored out from film prints since 1969)\n|animator = \n|occupation = \n|home = Mount Olympus\n|likes = Getting the job done\n|dislikes = Bacchus in trouble, Zeus's interruptions}}\n\n'''Otika '''is one of the minor protagonists from ''The Pastoral Symphony'' segment of the [[1940]] film ''[[Fantasia]]''. Though she appeared in the film while it was in theaters, she, like [[Sunflower]], has been removed from all releases of the film due to being a racist stereotype.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nLike Sunflower, Otika appears to be a very young Centaurette and is smaller than the other Centaurettes. Unlike Sunflower, Otika serves [[Bacchus (Fantasia)|Bacchus]] along with the Zebra Centaurettes. She is kind and is a great servant but will be uncertain what to do if her master, Bacchus, ends up drunk.\n\n==Role in the film==\nOtika is only seen once in the entire segment. She is seen rolling the red carpet down so that Bacchus can sit on a wooden chair. She is uncertain about this and when Bacchus falls off the chair she runs off and is not seen again in the rest of the segment.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Despite being a character from ''Fantasia'', Otika does not appear in future releases of the film. Just like the case with Sunflower, the scene that showed her is objectionable and was removed from the film to prevent racial controversy.\n*Like Sunflower, Otika is not seen or heard of at the Disney theme parks. Finding a publicity still of her in the film is more difficult than finding a still of Sunflower.\n**Also like Sunflower, Otika is neither seen in ''[[House of Mouse]]'' or any other Disney TV shows.\n**While ''Fantasia'' was released on [[Disney+]] and despite the outdated cultural depictions disclaimer, it shows the \"Pastoral Symphony\" segment still without Otika.\n* Otika only has one scene in the entire segment, which is less than that of Sunflower. She is seen rolling the red carpet down for Bacchus and then running off after he falls off a wooden chair.\n\n{{Fantasia}}\n[[Category:Fantasia characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Servants]]\n[[Category:Deleted characters]]\n[[Category:Hybrids]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Centaurs]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Greek characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
