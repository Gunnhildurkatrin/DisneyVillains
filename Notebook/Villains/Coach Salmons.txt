He is a recurring character in the series, voiced by Richard Simmons.\n\n==Role in the series==\nCoach Salmons first appeared when he announced the football players of [[Freshwater High]]. When [[Milo the Fish|Milo]] tried out for the football team, Coach Salmons saw agility and skill in Milo's tryouts. He said he as proud of him and that he has a star in his hands. But then, Coach Salmons made Milo \"water boy\" and belies that's his destiny. The next day, Milo figures out the game is in the Gecko Tank. Coach Salmons and the football team dehydrate, due to the tank being extremely hot. The Geckos said Coach Salmons could have water if he forfeits the game. Just then, Milo came and gave everyone water. Thanks to this, the fishes win the game. When the team cheered for Milo, he said he owes all this to Coach Salmons and called him the best coach ever. With that, he drenched him with a bucket full of water. But [[Bea Goldfishberg|Bea]] points out that it is the last of the water, making everyone dehydrate.\n==Gallery==\n<gallery captionalign=\"left\">\nSalmons.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Fish Hooks}}\n[[Category:Fish Hooks characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Fish]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Schoolteachers]]\n[[Category:Coaches]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
