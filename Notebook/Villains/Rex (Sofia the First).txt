He steals [[Cedric the Sorcerer|Cedric]]'s spell book and buries it for everyone to find it. It turns out that Rex loves to play games and like all dogs, he loves to bury bones. He is a bit goofy, but he claims he is smarter than he looks. Rex is also shown to be a bit forgetful. When Rex buries Cedric's spell book in \"Two Princesses and a Baby\" he forgets which hole he buried it in. As a result, [[Clover]] and his friends come up with a plan in order to find the location of the spell book.\n\nIn \"[[When You Wish Upon a Well]]\", he chases after [[Sofia the First (character)|Sofia]] when she becomes a cat. Sofia eventually manages to get away from him, and James puts him back on his leash.\n\n== Trivia ==\n*As he stated in \"When You Wish Upon a Well\", he does not listen to anyone but [[Prince James|his master]]. He does not even listen to Clover in \"[[Clover Time]]\" while cannonballing in Sofia's bed during the \"party\".\n*As stated in ''[[The Curse of Princess Ivy]]'', James spends a lot of time with him.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nRex getting perfumed.JPG|Rex getting perfumed\nSofia-James-Rex.JPG\nRex1.JPG|\"Your supposed to find the buried treasure.\"\nWhen You Wish Upon a Well 1.jpg\nWhen-You-Wish-Upon-a-Well-2.png|Rex chasing Sofia\nWhen-You-Wish-Upon-a-Well-5.png\nWhen-You-Wish-Upon-a-Well-13.png\nWhen You Wish Upon a Well 38.jpg\nWhen You Wish Upon a Well 8.jpg\nSofia-Rex1.JPG\nRex2.JPG\nSofia-Rex3.JPG\nRex-01.JPG\nSofia-James-Amber-Rex.JPG\nAmber-Sofia-James-Rex.JPG\nElf Situation-01.JPG\nFR animal cavalry.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Sofia the First}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Rex}}\n[[Category:Sofia the First characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
