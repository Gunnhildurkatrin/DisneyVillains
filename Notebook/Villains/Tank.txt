After Bradley blasts Max and Tank into a giant X-Games logo, Tank helps Max win the X-Games after Max saves him. Reforming after Max won the X-Games competition, Tank, acting in revenge on Brad for his betrayal and nearly getting him killed during the competition, grabs Brad and throws him into the\u00a0[[ESPN]]\u00a0blimp, or as he put it, \"get on the last jet to nowhere.\" As a result, he later became the new leader of the Gammas and possibly has the team stop cheating and compete fair in future competitions.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nExgoofy-disneyscreencaps.com-2057.jpg\nExgoofy-disneyscreencaps.com-2095.jpg\nExtremely-goofy-movie-disneyscreencaps.com-2605.jpg\nExtremely-goofy-disneyscreencaps.com-7271.jpg\nExgoofy-disneyscreencaps.com-4948.jpg\nExgoofy-disneyscreencaps.com-7826.jpg|Max and Tank sent rocketed towards the X-Games logo, setting it on fire!\nGoofy_&amp;_Max_saving_Tank_from_the_burning_Logo.jpg|Max and Goofy saving Tank from being burned alive.\nExgoofy-disneyscreencaps.com-7987.jpg|Tank helping Goofy and Max\nextremely-goofy-disneyscreencaps.com-8450.jpg|\"Brad!
