He is an eccentric, spot-fixated artist\u00a0who speaks with a [[France|French]] accent.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure]]''===\n[[Cruella De Vil|Cruella]] first meets Lars when she stumbles into an art house show. Lars' main style of art is shown to be black spots on a white surface, similar to that of a Dalmatian's coat. Impressed with the artwork, Cruella demands to meet the artist, to which Lars reveals she already has and the two introduce each other.\u00a0Lars is attracted to how Cruella is able to see his artistic vision and agrees to do a painting for her in exchange for her being his muse.\n\nOn his first painting for her, Cruella comments that it is\u00a0all wrong, despite his claim for it to be his best work yet. Cruella notes it needs to be better than his best, and after being seduced by Cruella, Lars vows to paint another canvas, one after another, until he has found artistic perfection and will not\u00a0stop until Cruella is pleased.\n\nMany failed attempts later, he submits in defeat about not being able to please Cruella, but she assures him that all he needs is some inspiration. She later returns with the captured [[Dalmatian puppies]], Lars then bursts out with joy and delight, hugging the puppies, believing that Cruella wants him to paint a portrait of them, when in fact she wants him to make art ''with'' the puppies (use their coats as canvas, etc.).\n\nShocked and horrified by this, Lars refuses, commenting how he may be eccentric, but is not a sicko and says she will not harm any of the puppies if he has anything to say about it. Cruella then gags him and ties him up in one of his paintings and calls Lars a disappointment, but figures if she cannot have a portrait, at least she can get a coat.\n\nLars\u00a0is later saved by [[Thunderbolt]] and he drives him to the bus station to help [[Patch]] before going to summon the police, whom he later gives a statement to, describing\u00a0how\u00a0mean Cruella was to him\u00a0and then\u00a0he passed out.\n\nIn the credits, it is shown he soon gets labeled as an artistic genius for all of his new spot paintings and the piece of splatter art that Patch actually made when being chased by [[Jasper and Horace]] earlier.\n\n===Video games===\nWhile Lars appears\u00a0in the ''[[101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure (video game)|Patch's London Adventure]]'' video game, he is shown as an enemy who will attack Patch\u00a0in the studio levels. This is despite the fact that, in the film, Lars refuses to let any harm come to the Dalmatian pups and also helps Patch against Cruella. He uses his paintbrush as a weapon in the game.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Lars is sometimes thought to be [[Germany|German]], but this is false, as he normally speaks with a [[France|French]] accent and has even used French terms (such as ''bourgeois'').\n*Lars rarely uses contractions in his vocabulary, giving him a rather distinctive dialogue.\n*It is unknown why he was cast as an enemy in the ''[[101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure (video game)|Patch's London Adventure]]'' video game.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nLars.jpg\nLarspatch03.jpg\nLars2.jpg\n101Dalmatas2byedorantes00-13-13000.jpg|Lars with Cruella\n101dII-02.jpg\nLars standing up to Cruella.jpg|Lars standing up to Cruella\n101-dalmatians-2-disneyscreencaps.com-7320.jpg|Lars giving a thumbs up\nFebruary3rd.png|Lars' page in ''[[Disneystrology]]''\n</gallery>\n\n{{101 Dalmatians}}\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:101 Dalmatians characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Artists]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:French characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
