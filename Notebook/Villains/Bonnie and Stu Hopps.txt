They are the parents of [[Judy Hopps]] and her 275 brothers and sisters.\n\n==Background==\nBonnie and Stu are resident rabbits in [[Bunnyburrow]], raising their many children simultaneously with the family farming business. Stu is the more cautious of the two and tends to clings to dated depictions of predators, heightening his sense of protection around his children; Bonnie is more understanding of her children's decisions and not nearly as paranoid as Stu, though she is not any more progressive than Stu, either.\n\n===Official Description===\n:''Mrs. Hopps loves and supports her daughter, but is a hare nervous about Judy moving to Zootopia to become a big-city police officer. Stu Hopps is a carrot farmer from Bunnyburrow. Along with Mrs. Hopps, he is worried about Judy moving to Zootopia and the untrustworthy big-city mammals who live there\u2014especially foxes.''<ref>[http://blogs.disney.com/oh-my-disney/2015/10/26/meet-the-characters-in-zootopia/ ''Oh My Disney'': \"Meet the Characters in Zootopia\".]</ref>\n\n==Role in the [[Zootopia|film]]==\nBonnie and Stu, along with several of their children, watch their daughter Judy's community play based on the city of [[Zootopia (location)|Zootopia]] during [[Bunnyburrow]]'s county fair. After the play and returning to their carrot stand, the couple tries to sway Judy away from becoming a police officer when she grows older, as rabbits are not traditionally police officers, and encourage her to become a carrot farmer with the family instead. However, Judy voices her desire to make the world a better place by becoming an officer.\n\nJudy eventually enrolls in [[Zootopia Police Academy]] years later and graduates as valedictorian of her class. At her graduation ceremony, Bonnie and Stu observe Judy being officially inducted, but also exchange looks of concern when they realize Judy's new job requires her to move to the city. At the train station, Bonnie, Stu, and the rest of Judy's family gather to say their farewells. Bonnie and Stu both express reluctance and acceptance for Judy in Zootopia, with Stu packing several fox-repelling items for Judy in case she runs into trouble with foxes, though Judy only agrees to take the fox repellent to keep her parents' worries low. At first, she gets on the train but rushes back to hug her parents and kiss their cheeks, assuring them that she loves them (and vice-versa), and Stu cries when she gets back on, but Bonnie tells him to pull himself together. Once in Zootopia, Judy is designated as a meter maid on her first day in the force, much to her dismay, and becomes disillusioned of Zootopia's perfection after she gets tricked by a [[Nick Wilde|fox]] herself. After returning to her apartment, Bonnie and Stu call her and learn what has happened, both becoming delighted that Judy is in a relatively safe position. However, they console Judy and remind her that being a carrot farmer is still an available option.\n\nThey keep in contact with Judy by phone, including one phone call later on that accidentally almost exposed Judy when she was spying on [[Mayor Lionheart]] for evidence. When the city is thrown into chaos between predators and prey, Judy, feeling guilty and ashamed for her part in causing it, resigns from the force and returns to Bunnyburrow, becoming a carrot farmer with her family. Despite having their daughter back, Bonnie and Stu notice how depressed Judy is and show her the good examples that have come out for predators: after being inspired by Judy, Bonnie and Stu partnered up with the fox [[Gideon Grey]], Judy's former childhood bully, and his baking business. As Gideon apologizes to Judy for his past cruelty, some rabbit children run towards them for Gideon's pies. Stu immediately warns them to stay away from some violet flowers growing around their crops. When Judy asks what the flowers are, Stu explains that the plants cause severe psychotropic effects on animals, so he grows them to protect the crops from bugs. Gideon adds to this, mentioning that the plants are nicknamed \"[[Night howlers|night howlers]]\" by his family. Hearing this and having an epiphany, Judy takes Stu's truck to drive to Zootopia, leaving Bonnie, Stu, and Gideon bewildered over what got her so excited.\n\nDuring the end credits, Bonnie and Stu are seen dancing together at a concert held by [[Gazelle]], unaware that Judy is there as well with her friend [[Nick Wilde]].\n\n==Trivia==\n*Bonnie shares her first name with her voice actress, [[Bonnie Hunt]].\n*Both Bonnie Hunt and [[Don Lake]] have appeared in various projects together before, as well as being close friends.\n*Their names are a play on \"'''bunny''' rabbit\" and \"rabbit '''stew'''\".\n*In earlier versions of the film, Stu wore glasses.\n*Stu is always mixing up his S and Z's and used to sign his name as Ztu.<ref>https://twitter.com/_rich_moore/status/723978341779296256 Rich Moore via Twitter</ref>\n*There are a couple of earlier scenes of Stu and Bonnie which were discarded from the final film:\n**In the first one, when a depressed Judy returns to her apartment after her first day as a meter maid, she is called by her mother who is seen holding a baby and notices that something is wrong as she sees that Judy's ears are droopy and Stu asks if she used her fox taser and offers to pick her up in his truck and but Judy convinces them that she's just tired without revealing to them that she's just a meter maid and her mother tells to continue making chances for herself<ref>[http://www.geeksofdoom.com/2015/12/03/zootopia-co-director-jared-bush-writer-phil-johnston-talk-perfecting-script 'Zootopia' Co-Director Jared Bush and Writer Phil Johnston Talk Perfecting Script Over and Over Again] at ''Geeks of Doom'', December 3rd, 2015</ref>. \n**In the second one, Judy and Nick go to her apartment and find Judy's family there, having dropped in for a surprise visit, worried about her not calling them, and they're shocked by Nick's presence and Stu asks Judy to pass him the fox taser and when Judy tells him that Nick is more than a fox, Stu worriedly assumes that he is Judy's boyfriend, and one of Judy's siblings find her meter maid uniform, revealing that Judy lied to them about being a real cop and an angry Stu tries to take her back home, but Nick convinces them to give her a chance to stay to solve her case, and they leave, but not before warning them about a savage animal being on the loose and Stu asking Judy again if Nick is her boyfriend, and she shuts her door in annoyance.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Concept art===\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nBonnie and Stu concept.png\n</gallery>\n\n===Promotional Material===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nZootopia Poster.jpg\nZootopia Japanese poster.jpg\nBonnie-and-Stu-Hopps-Zootopia.jpg\nBonnie and Don .png\n</gallery>\n\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\n\nZootopia-disneyscreencaps.com-257.jpg|Bonnie and Stu become worried when Judy announces that she wants to become a police officer\nZootopia-disneyscreencaps.com-272.jpg|Bonnie and Stu try to convince Judy to become a carrot farmer\nZootopia Bonnie Stu and the kids.jpg\nZootopia Judy w parents.jpg\nHerecomethewaterworks.jpg|\"Oh, cripes, here come the waterworks!\"<br>\"Oh, Stu, pull it together.\"\nZootopia Bonnie & Stu call.png\nJudy's Parents Cell.png\nParents-sad-Judy.PNG|\"You're not fine, your ears are droopy\"\nZootopia-disneyscreencaps.com-9217.jpg\nZootopia-disneyscreencaps.com-9309.jpg\nZootopia-disneyscreencaps.com-9315.jpg|Stu telling his children to stay away from the [[Night howlers]]\nZootopia-disneyscreencaps.com-9328.jpg\nZootopia-disneyscreencaps.com-9433.jpg\nZootopia-disneyscreencaps.com-11600.jpg|Bonnie and Stu at Gazelle's concert\n\n</gallery>\n\n===Deleted Scenes===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nJudy's family photos.png|Judy's family photos in the deleted scene\nDid you use the fox taser.png|\"Did you use the fox taser?\"\nNoonegoteaten.png|\"No one got eaten\"\nWhat's wrong.png|\"What's wrong?\"\nYour ears are droopy.png|\"You're not fine, your ears are droopy\"\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Zootopia}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hopps, Bonnie and Stu}}\n[[ar:\u0628\u0648\u0646\u064a \u0648\u0633\u062a\u0648 \u0647\u0648\u0628\u0632]]\n[[de:Bonnie und Stu Hopps]]\n[[fr:Bonnie et Stu Hopps]]\n[[pt-br:Bonnie e Gil Hopps]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Rabbits]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Zootopia characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Farmers]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Disney Crossy Road characters]]\n[[Category:Wonderful World of Color]]\n[[Category:Grandparents]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
