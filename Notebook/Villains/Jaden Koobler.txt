A member of the Don\u2019t Bothers, who was a hardcore gamer before he becomes their goalie.\n\n==Biography==\n===Recruitment and New Friendships===\nKoob is first introduced when [[Evan Morrow|Evan]] and Nick are trying to recruit for the Don't Bothers. The two play against Koob on a video game and try to track him down, given he has a high score and a long track record of winning. When they find him, however, he is largely an introvert, refined to his basement room at his moms house. Koob is reluctant to join the Don't Bothers, but is eventually persuaded by Nick and Evan. \n\nKoob finds it difficult on the Don't Bothers, however, as he struggles making friends given his shy personality. He is invited over to Nick's house for a sleepover with [[Evan Morrow|Evan]], but struggles when his phone is taken away at night. He remarks that scrolling is the only thing that allows him to get to sleep at night. After a stealthy operation to retrieve the phone, however, Koob remarks that he had more fun hanging out with Evan and Nick than he would've otherwise had he spent the time scrolling on his phone. From this point, Koob becomes close friends with Evan and Nick and an integral part of the team. \n\n==Trivia==\n*Koob can be described as an introvert before joining the Don't Bothers. Whilst not entirely, this character trait was weakened after joining the Don't Bothers.\n*He looks like [[Greg Goldberg]]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"185\">\nThe Mighty Ducks Game Changers - Poster.jpeg\nThe Mighty Ducks Game Changers - Koob the Gamer.jpeg\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Mighty Ducks}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:The Mighty Ducks characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Students]]"
