Her personality is similar to that of Alex\u00a0because she is characterized as lazy, sarcastic, artistic, and selfish but more so than her niece. She despises her family\u00a0because\u00a0Jerry\u00a0opted to give his powers to the much less qualified\u00a0Kelbo. Afterward, she cut all ties with her\u00a0family\u00a0and\u00a0magic, then moved to a loft in Paris, Texas where she \"works\" as a painter.\n\nMegan was introduced in \"Retest\" where the Russo's try to convince her to retake the\u00a0wizard competition, but Megan's bitterness with Jerry is ongoing and as a result, she refuses to take the test. However, a lecture from Alex and Theresa managed to let her see past her grudge and become more willing to move on.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Alex===\nMegan is like Alex in many ways. They are both lazy, artistic, they hold grudges, and they both are aggressive. She has a little more of all of these traits than Alex does. She is also different from Alex. Alex will always stick together with her family, while Megan left and avoided her family after Jerry gave his wizard powers to Kelbo.\n\n==Trivia==\n*It is shown in the episode \"Retest\u00a0\" that Megan, Jerry, and Kelbo are parallel in personalities to Alex, Justin, and Max respectively.\n*As Jerry's children are\u00a0wizards\u00a0even though he became a father after giving away his powers, any children that Megan might have in the future would also be wizards.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Russo, Megan}}\n{{Wizards of Waverly Place}}\n[[Category:Wizards of Waverly Place Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Aunts]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Italian characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
