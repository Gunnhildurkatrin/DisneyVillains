She was voiced by [[Emily Alyn Lind]].\n\n==Background==\nGrace is depicted as being a red-head with big ears and buck teeth. She wears a pink sweatshirt bearing the cameos of [[Disney Princesses]], [[Snow White]], [[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]], and [[Rapunzel]].\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Prep & Landing: Naughty vs. Nice]]''===\nGrace is a young girl who has been placed on [[Santa Claus]]' Naughty List, a distinction which she blames on the actions of her toddler brother, Gabriel Goodwin, who destroyed her Miss Whiskers toy and ruined her chances of asking Santa Claus for a new one.\n\nDetermined to remove herself from the Naughty List, Grace manages to capture a Fruitcake Conduct Calculator, left behind in the aftermath of an ambush she set for the Coal Elves. Later, using the screenname of \"'''jinglesmell1337'''\", she attempts to hack into the Database Tree Farm at the North Pole. Her efforts cause [[Wayne]] and [[Lanny]] (along with Wayne's younger brother [[Noel]], a Coal Elf) to be dispatched on a secret mission to retrieve the Conduct Calculator.\n\nDuring their mission, Grace captures Lanny and explains her problems to him. She then eventually manages to succeed in hacking into the database and appears successful in her goal, but the device malfunctions and starts transferring ''all'' the nice kids on the planet to the naughty list. Upon finding out what's happening, Grace feels remorse for her actions and rewires the Conduct Calculator back to its original state before Wayne and Noel attach it to a powerful antenna in the middle of the city. In the process, she learns to be more appreciative of her little brother. At the end of the special, Grace is shown having received a new Miss Whiskers toy from Santa, and then giving Gabriel a hug and wishing him Merry Christmas.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nPrep landing 2 03.jpg|Grace discovering Lanny\nGrace interrogating Lanny.jpg|Grace questioning Lanny\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*[[w:c:prepandlanding:Grace Goodwin|Prep &amp; Landing Wiki: Grace Goodwin]]\n*[[w:c:christmas-specials:Grace Goodwin|Christmas Specials Wiki: Grace Goodwin]]\n\n{{Prep & Landing}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Goodwin, Grace}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Prep & Landing characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]"
