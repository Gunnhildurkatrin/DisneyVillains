She removed [[Isabella Garcia-Shapiro|Isabella]]'s tonsils (\"[[I Scream, You Scream]]\"). Dr. Hirano was first mentioned (and spoken of) when Stacy\u00a0told [[Candace Flynn|Candace]] that she was getting her ears pierced.\n==Relationships==\n===[[Stacy Hirano]]===\nDr. Hirano is Stacy's mother. On Phineas and Ferb's Parents' Anniversary, they are only seen chatting on the phone (\"[[Dude, We're Getting the Band Back Together]]\"). She also seems to think that her daughter is not very smart, due to Stacy frequently asking Candace to call her mom \"and tell her that\" when Candace refers to Stacy as a genius.\n\n===[[Candace Flynn]]===\nDr. Hirano thinks Candace is flighty and unfocused because she rather bust her brothers than doing what she and Stacy are doing. However, she seems to think of her differently after seeing how determined she is to bust her brothers. She is also referred to Mrs. Hirano by her.\n\n===[[Ginger Hirano|Ginger]]===\nDr. Hirano is the mother of Ginger. It's currently unclear how well Ginger gets along with her due to a lack of interaction. \u00a0\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nThe Hirano family.jpg\nOne Good Turn - Stacy and Ginger.jpg\nChar_40816.jpg\nPhineas and Ferb-Dr. Hirano Isabella's tonsils.jpg\nLinda Talking To Dr. Hirano.png\nDr. Hirano Thinks That Candace Is Focus.png\nDr. Hirano Letting Stacy Go To The Concert With Candace.png\nGinger Gives Her Mom Another Trophy.png\nThe_Hirano_Family_Comic.png\n</gallery>\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{PF-Wiki}}\n{{Phineas and Ferb}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hirano}}\n[[Category:Phineas and Ferb characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]\n[[Category:Japanese characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
