She is responsible for keeping all penguins around the island informed about the weekly news. She is such a skillful writer that she even has her own advice column, \"Ask Aunt Arctic\", where she makes it her duty to answer any troubling questions her fellow penguins might have. Any penguin can submit his or her question to Aunt Arctic for a chance at submission. She is a key character in Mission #1, in which she had lost her green and purple puffles that needed to be returned. She owned a Purple Puffle before they were available in the Pet Shop.\n\n==History==\n===''Club Penguin''===\nSince she first appeared, she had a column in the local newspaper, the Penguin Times, answering questions from players.
