The husband of [[Mrs. Otterton]], he goes missing and mysteriously turns savage. The search for the missing otter becomes the driving force of the film.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Zootopia]]''===\nIn the film, Mr. Otterton had urgent matters to discuss with his good friend and employer [[Mr. Big (Zootopia)|Mr. Big]]. He contacted Mr. Big, who sent a limousine to pick him up. Before that, he bought a [[pawpsicle]] from [[Nick Wilde]] and went to the Mystic Springs Oasis. When [[Yax]] and Nangi walked him out, [[Mr. Manchas]] picked him up in a limousine and started driving him to Mr. Big's mansion.\n\nThat night during the escort, however, Otterton is shot by a [[Doug (Zootopia)|sniper]] with a pellet containing [[Night howlers|night howler]] serum, causing Otterton to regress to a savage state. In his last moments of sanity, Otterton madly yells \"night howlers\" as a warning to what had happened to him. When Manchas overhears the commotion, Otterton attacks him, brutally maiming the jaguar's eye and forcing the car to stop off-road while Manchas barely manages to get away alive from the now feral otter. With a snarl, Otterton then scurries off into the night. He is eventually captured by wolf security forces under the orders of [[Mayor Lionheart]] and incarcerated at [[Cliffside Asylum]] with other predatory citizens who also have gone savage.\n\nTen days later, Mr. Otterton is located by Officer [[Judy Hopps]] and [[Nick Wilde]], who was sent by Mrs. Otterton to find him, but only receive a fierce snarl from the otter, his sentience apparently absent from his mind. After the asylum is raided, Otterton is moved to a hospital, though still remains in his feral state. When Mrs. Otterton visits her husband, she is heartbroken to see the Emmitt she knew to be lost.\n\nWhen it is discovered that the night howlers were the cause of the outbreak as an elaborate plot by Assistant Mayor [[Bellwether]], an antidote for the savaged citizens is found. Among them, Mr. Otterton is eventually cured of his savage condition and happily reunites with his wife, who is there when he wakes up to sanity.\n\nDuring the end credits, Mr. and Mrs. Otterton are seen at a concert held by [[Gazelle]], happily dancing together.\n\n===Other appearances===\nAn emoticon version of Mr. Otterton frequently appeared in the ''Zootopia'' entry of the ''[[As Told by Emoji]]'' short series.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\n\nZootopia (film) 08.png\nOtterton family photo.jpg|Photo showing Mr. Otterton with [[Mrs. Otterton|his wife]] and their two kids\nZootopia-disneyscreencaps.com-4017.jpg|Judy examines the photo more closely.\nZootopia-disneyscreencaps.com-10053.jpg\nZootopia-disneyscreencaps.com-10056.jpg|Mr. Otterton gets hit with night howler serum\nMr. Otterton realizes what he was shot with.png|Mr. Otterton panics when he realizes he was shot with Night howler serum\nSavage Otterton.jpeg|Mr. Otterton goes savage\nZootopia Savage Oterton.png\nSavage Otterton 02.png|A captive Mr. Otterton in Cliffside Asylum, hiding from Nick and Judy\nSavage Otterton 03.png\nSavage Otterton 04.png|Mr. Otterton viciously trying to assault Nick and Judy\nZootopia-disneyscreencaps.com-8817.jpg\nZootopia-disneyscreencaps.com-8833.jpg\nZootopia-disneyscreencaps.com-10043.jpg\nZootopia-disneyscreencaps.com-11060.jpg|Emmitt starts to awaken\nOtter Hug.png|Mr. Otterton, cured from his savaged infection, hugs his wife\nZootopia-disneyscreencaps com-11613.jpg\n\n</gallery>\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nZootopia_Poster.jpg\nZootopia Japanese poster.jpg\nHell-or-High-Otter.jpg\nZootopia-Small-Plush-Mr.-Otterton.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*According to the police report, Mr. Otterton is 2'4\" in height, weighs 21 pounds, and has an address at 2347 Riverbrook Lane in Rainforest District.<ref name=\"File\" />\n**However, a deleted scene \"Detective Work\"\u00a0shows that Otterton weighs 20 pounds.\n**In the same deleted scene, Otterton's zip code is 91521, which is a zip code where the Walt Disney Studios building is located in Burbank, California.\n*Mr. Otterton's full name is a reference to the ''[[w:c:Muppets:Emmett Otter's Jug-Band Christmas|Emmett Otter's Jug-Band Christmas]]'' TV special, according to [[Byron Howard]].<ref>[http://www.stumbleupon.com/su/5ov9c8/momontheside.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-zootopia Everything You Need to Know About Zootopia] January 6th, 2016</ref>\n*He is a frequent attendant of the Mystic Springs Oasis naturalist club, owned by [[Yax]].\n*It is strongly implied that Mr. Otterton somehow figured out the night howler operation, due to his described desperation to talk to Mr. Big, as well as his mad wailing of the night howlers before becoming savage. Given his occupation as a florist, it is possible. This could also explain why he was targeted: to ensure his silence.\n*According to ''[[Zootopia: The Official Handbook]]'', Mr. Otterton first met his wife at the Sunday Meerkat Market in [[Sahara Square]] 20 years before the events of the film, where the latter was looking at spicy lentils.\n*Emmitt's voice is never heard.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Zootopia}}\n{{Disney Crossy Road}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Otterton, Mr.}}\n[[ar:\u0627\u0644\u0633\u064a\u062f \u0642\u0646\u062f\u0633\u062a\u0648\u0646]]\n[[pl:Emil Wydralski]]\n[[pt-br:Sr. Lontroza]]\n[[ru:\u041c\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440 \u0412\u044b\u0434\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0442\u043e\u043d]]\n[[Category:Zootopia characters]]\n[[Category:Otters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Disney Crossy Road characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
