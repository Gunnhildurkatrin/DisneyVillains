He appeared in the ''[[DuckTales]]'' two-part series finale, \"[[The Golden Goose]]\".\n\n==Trivia==\n*Like his brother, his name comes from a type of French mustard.\n*Like Dijon in the episode [[Attack of the Metal Mites]], he mispronounces [[Flintheart Glomgold]]'s name.\n*It's unknown if he is older or younger than his brother, though considering how much taller he is than Dijon, it's most likely the former. It's likely though that they're twins.\n*According to some dialogue when Dijon and Poupon reunite, it's revealed that Poupon was always the moralistic brother while Dijon was always a thief ever since the two were kids.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nDijon03.jpg\nDijon05.jpg\nDijon06.jpg\nRedeemed.jpg\nScratchPoupon.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{DuckTales}}\n[[Category:DuckTales characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Middle Eastern characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
