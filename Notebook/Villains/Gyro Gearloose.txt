He is part of the ''Donald Duck'' character cast, appearing in stories as a friend of [[Donald Duck]], [[Scrooge McDuck|Uncle Scrooge]], and anyone who is associates with them in any way.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:GyrosDebut.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Gyro with [[Gladstone Gander]] in his debut, ''Gladstone's Terrible Secret'' ([[1952]]).]]\nGyro is [[Duckburg]]'s most famous inventor, even though his inventions don't always work the way he wants them to. His outrageous productivity is presented as a factor in the quality of his inventions; because he always comes up with new ideas, the fact that his inventions often lack an important feature will often cause trouble for Scrooge or Donald who has bought the invention. He is known as being good-natured toward others. Gyro is often assisted by his [[Little Helper]] (or just \"Helper\"), who is a small robot with a light bulb for a head. Besides Little Helper, he has also a thinking cap, a combination of a roof-top and a nest, with three blackbirds living in it.\n\nIn high school, young Gyro was a baseball pitcher with his \"madball\" pitch - actually only a straight-ball pitch. When Gyro is forced to pitch for the Northside, pitting an \"unhittable\" baseball against another of his inventions, an \"unmissable\" baseball bat made for the Southside team, resulting in total chaos.\n\nSome of Gyro's relatives include his father [[Fulton Gearloose]]<ref>''Uncle Scrooge Adventures #27: Guardians of the Library''</ref>, his grandfather Ratchet Gearloose, who worked as Scrooge McDuck's engineer on Scrooge's riverboat, the \"Dilly Dollar\" (as shown in ''[https://inducks.org/story.php?c=W+USGD++1-02 The Fantastic River Race]'' by Carl Barks), and [[Newton Gearloose]], his nephew. His relatives are often named after famous inventors and scientists (Robert Fulton, Isaac Newton, Nicolaus Copernicus, Galileo Galilei, etc.). Like his son, Fulton was also an inventor, and one of the first members of the [[Junior Woodchucks]]. In some stories, Gyro's primary rival is [[Emil Eagle]], although he is also antagonized by the [[Beagle Boys]] and [[Magica De Spell]] on occasions. With his inventions, he is also a very important ally of [[Donald Duck]]'s alter ego, [[The Duck Avenger]] in the Italian Disney comics.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''Mickey Mouse and the Marvelous Smell Machine''===\nIn this 1979 scratch-and-sniff book, Gyro invents a smell machine.<ref>http://comicbookrehab.blogspot.com/2014/06/the-apocryphal-scrooge-mcduck-part-2.html</ref> There is an attempt to use the machine to get rid of a mothball odor. The machine can produce a lavender smell, a pepper smell, and a smoke smell, amongst others. The book was renamed and reprinted as ''Mickey Mouse Scratch and Sniff Book'' in 1990.\n\n===''[[Sport Goofy in Soccermania]]''===\n\nGyro made his first animated appearance in the 1987 television special with only one line of dialogue, voiced by [[Will Ryan]]: \"Scrooge parting with a million dollars?\".\n\n===''[[DuckTales]]''===\n[[File:GyroGearloose.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Gyro as he appeared in ''DuckTales''.]]\nIn the subsequent 1987 TV series ''DuckTales'', Gyro became a regular character, with the late [[Hal Smith (actor)|Hal Smith]] supplying his voice. Among Gyro's noteworthy inventions in the series is the creation of the [[Fenton Crackshell|Gizmoduck]] [[Gizmosuit|suit]], intended to be worn by a security guard for Scrooge McDuck's Money Bin. Although Gyro's shop and house are on the south side of Duckburg, he was born on the north side \u2015 a sign marks his birthplace and mentions one of his inventions - topless hats. Despite Flintheart Glomgold being an enemy of Scrooge's, Gyro built the giant construction robots for him in \"[[Robot Robbers]]\".\n\nGyro also appeared in both of the ''DuckTales'' NES games. In [[DuckTales (video game)|the first game]], he appears only in the bonus stage that can be accessed if Scrooge exits a level with a 7 in the ten-thousand digit on the score. In ''[[DuckTales 2]]'', he can be found in three of the levels, providing upgrades for Scrooge's cane. The [[DuckTales Remastered|HD remake]] of the first game gives Gyro an expanded role, prominently appearing in cut scenes in the African Mines and Moon levels. Here, he is voiced by [[Chris Edgerly]].\n\n===''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]''===\n\nGyro makes a cameo appearance at the end of the episode \"[[Down the Hatch]]\", together with several other scientists. Notably, this is his first animated appearance alongside [[Ludwig Von Drake]], with whom he does frequently interact in the comics.\n\n===[[DuckTales (2017 series)|''DuckTales'' (2017)]]===\n[[File:Maxresdefault-0.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Gyro in the DuckTales reboot.]]\nGyro appears in the reboot series as Scrooge's personal mad scientist, voiced by [[Jim Rash]]. In addition to being Scrooge's scientist, he is assisted by Fenton (as an intern) and Little Bulb like the original. In this series, Gyro has white hair and wears a green suit as opposed to his red hair and pink suit in the original series, and appears to be physically younger as well. His lab is now located in a basement beneath [[The Money Bin]]. He is also less friendly and more eccentric compared to most portrayals of the character, his personality and inventions both described by the writers as \"wildly misunderstood\". However, in spite of his arrogance, he's a good person deep down and, he still cares about his inventions, not hesitating to stop them from doing further damage and protecting those he cares about. He also utters out \"blatherin' blatherskite\", which was originally Fenton's expression, whenever he's frustrated and even named his newest idea, \"Project Blatherskite\". In the second season episode \"[[What Ever Happened to Della Duck?!]]\", it is revealed that he has worked for Scrooge for at least ten years, since [[Della Duck]] used his Oxy-Chew to survive in the moon.\n\nThe episode \"[[The Outlaw Scrooge McDuck!]]\" revealed that, in Scrooge's personal timeline, he had first met Gyro when Gyro, while testing out his new time machine, travelled back in time to the old west and got stuck there, meeting Scrooge while both (alongside [[Goldie O'Gilt]]) were in the jail of the town of Grumption. He, alongside Marshall Cabrera, later helped Scrooge defeat [[John D. Rockerduck]]. However, Scrooge never knew his name, only realizing who it was when, after Scrooge told Louie about his encounter with Rockerduck, Gyro appeared before them in a time machine.\n\nIn \"[[Moonvasion!]]\", Gyro is a part of Scrooge McDuck's army against the Moonlanders. During battle, he summons multiple clones of himself to charge against the retaliating aliens while Scrooge devises a plan to find Lunaris and stop him from destroying Earth. Fortunately, the battle between Duckburg and the Moon was successful.\n\n[[File:DuckTales(2017)-S03E06-Astro B.O.Y.D.!-YoungGyro-05.png|thumb|left|250px|A young, happier Gyro in Astro B.O.Y.D.!.]]\nThe episode \"[[Astro B.O.Y.D.!]]\" delves into Gyro's youth as an intern for his mentor Dr. [[Akita]] in the [[Japan]]ese city of [[Tokyo]]lk, where he helped in the creation of [[B.O.Y.D.]], having initially created him as a benevolent defense drone who he treated like his own child. Gyro's younger design shown in photographs and memory recordings closely resembles his physical appearance of the character's previous iterations, such as his hair and clothes, albeit varying in color: His hair was still white instead of the traditional red, and his shirt was still green instead of the traditional pink. His personality was also closer to previous incarnations of the character, his naivety and optimism leaving him easily manipulated and mistreated by Akita, who tricked him into believing B.O.Y.D.'s malfunctions were his fault, and leaving Gyro disgraced. After discovering the truth years later, Gyro was able to talk down a malfunctioning B.O.Y.D., embracing him as they reconciled. Realizing he himself had been exploited by Akita, Gyro made an effort to treat Fenton better, promoting him as his equal (in spite of Fenton informing him that's not how doctorates work).\n\nIn the episode \"[[The Last Adventure!]]\", Gyro asks of Lil Bulb to \"Look after your brother.\", referring to Boyd. As of this episode, Gyro seems to have grown closer to the robot boy, and we see a softer, fatherly, side to him.\n\n==Video games==\n===''[[Toontown Online]]''===\nIn the [[Toontown]] storyline, Gyro created a robot that, when Scrooge accidentally wired it incorrectly, made the Cogs, the main antagonists of the game. They are grim businessmen-like robots who can't take a joke, so to take care of the infestation, the toons (the main protagonists of the game), destroy them with gags, such as squirting seltzer water and throwing pies at them.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Gyro Gearloose is one of the more obscure characters from [[Duckburg]], who has a song written about them: \"[[Gyro Gearloose (song)|Gyro Gearloose]]\" from [[Michael and Patricia Silversher|Michael Silversher]] and [[Jymn Magon]]'s [[1983]] album ''[[Mickey Mouse Splashdance]]''.\n*Gyro Gearloose's voice actor from the [[DuckTales (2017 series)|''DuckTales'' reboot]], Jim Rash, previously worked on the [[Disney XD]] animated series ''[[Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja]]'' as the principal of [[Norrisville High]], [[Principal Slimovitz]].\n**Jim is also reunited with [[Ben Schwartz]], who voiced [[Randy Cunningham]] in the show.\n*Gundolf K\u00f6hler's WSG nickname was Daniel D\u00fcsentrieb, the German name of Gyro Gearloose.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Inducks character|GY}}\n\n{{Mickey Mouse & Friends}}\n{{DuckTales}}\n{{Disney Crossy Road}}\n{{Mickey Mouse (TV series)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gearloose, Gyro}}\n[[ar:\u0639\u0628\u0642\u0631\u064a\u0646\u0648 \u0642\u0644\u0627\u0648\u0648\u0638]]\n[[da:Georg Gearl\u00f8s (karakter)]]\n[[es:Ungenio Tarconi]]\n[[fi:Pelle Peloton]]\n[[fr:G\u00e9o Trouvetou]]\n[[it:Archimede Pitagorico]]\n[[nl:Willie Wortel]]\n[[pl:Diodak]]\n[[ru:\u0412\u0438\u043d\u0442 \u0420\u0430\u0437\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0442\u0430\u0439\u043b\u043e]]\n[[Category:DuckTales characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Toontown characters]]\n[[Category:Disney on Ice characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Inventors]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Chickens]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Knights]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse (TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Time travelers]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Carl Barks]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Darkwing Duck characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck: Goin' Quackers! characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Crossy Road characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
