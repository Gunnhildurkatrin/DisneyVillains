In the movie's script, they are instead referred to as Grunge Girls,<ref>[http://thescriptsavant.com/pdf/AGoofyMovie.pdf ''A Goofy Movie'' screenplay] presented by Scriptdude</ref> but they are very clearly Goth Girls in the final version of the movie, as Grunge is a very different subculture from Goth.\n*The script also describes the \"Grunge Girls\" as \"looking equally disgusted with the proceeding\" as they disembark from the school bus. Evidently, this was changed at some point since, in the final version of the movie, the one Goth Girl seen exiting the bus sings along with the other students in a pleasant, happy manner.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Goof Troop}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Goofy Movie Characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]"
