He enjoys fishing and baseball. He is also a bully to Nick, but during their adventure, he warms toward him and finally becomes his friend. He is tough, but when [[Antie]], the ant he befriended, died after being attacked by a [[The Scorpion|scorpion]], he broke down and cried. He's also known to be smarter than he gives himself credit for and has very creative ideas: such as being able to construct a booby trap in his backyard, using a crossbow, that fires a suction cup arrow, marked with superglue, rigged to Russ' fishing rod, to catch intruders. As well as improving on Amy's earlier idea, which involved using a piece of cookie to lure Antie, by rigging it to a stick, which is then placed in front of the Ant, to make it follow it, while attaching a blade of grass to it, so it can tow Amy, Nick and Russ Jr..\n\n==Role in the film==\n=== ''[[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids]]'' ===\nRon is 12 years old. He is the younger son of [[Russ Thompson, Sr.]] and [[Mae Thompson]] and younger brother of [[Russ Thompson, Jr.|Russ Jr.]] He is often rude to his neighbor [[Nick Szalinski]]. After accidently hitting his baseball through the Szalinski's window, which unknowingly activates [[Wayne Szalinski|Wayne Szalinski's]] [[Szalinzki's Shrinking Machine|Shrinking Machine]], Russ Jr. has him get it, but Ron along with Russ, Nick and the latter's sister [[Amy Szalinski|Amy]] are accidently shrunk by the Shrinking machine.
