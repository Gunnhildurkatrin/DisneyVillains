After the Dalmatian family arrives in the village, they are greeted by the Labrador who informs them about his owner having a truck that will take them to [[London]] as soon as it gets its engine\u00a0repaired. But soon the three dogs notice that [[Cruella De Vil|Cruella]], [[Jasper and Horace|Horace, and Jasper]] are at the village. After seeing [[Patch]] and [[Lucky (101 Dalmatians)|Lucky]] covered in soot from a nearby fireplace, [[Pongo]]\u00a0gets the idea of covering themselves in soot to distract the villains. The Labrador says that's a good idea. After all the [[Dalmatian puppies|puppies]] are covered in soot, the Labrador helps Pongo and [[Perdita]] escort the puppies to the truck in groups. As soon as the truck is fixed, Cruella discovers the ruse and orders her minions to catch the puppies. The Labrador attacks Jasper and Horace, giving Pongo and Lucky enough time to get in the truck with Perdita and the rest of the puppies. He isn't seen or even heard of again for the rest of the film.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\n101-dalmatians-disneyscreencaps.com-7776.jpg\n101-dalmatians-disneyscreencaps.com-7840.jpg|\"See that van down the street?
