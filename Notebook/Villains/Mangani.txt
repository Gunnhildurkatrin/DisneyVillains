He is the healing spirit of the jungle. He wanders the jungle curing the sick and the wounded animals in need of healing with the help of the full moon's light which gives him his powers.\n\n==Tarzan and the Silver Ape==\nMangani is first seen miraculously bringing a deer back to life after falling 200 feet from a cliff in front of [[Tarzan (character)|Tarzan]] and [[Archimedes Q. Porter|Porter]]'s eyes.\n\nLater, the next night, Mangani has his picture taken by Porter who seems fascinated and interested in studying him. Unfortunately, Porter's discovery is stolen once again by his academic archrival, [[Samuel T. Philander|Philander]], who now wishes to capture Mangani with his men and show him to the world and probably have him stuffed in a museum in England.\n\nThe next night, Mangani is captured by Philander in a cage after being tricked into following a wounded or sick animal's moan, which was actually a recording on a phonograph. Mangani tries to hypnotize Philander so as to release him but it fails when one of Philander's men snaps him out of it.\n\nMangani is then put on a ship leaving for England. When Porter and Tarzan try to rescue Mangani, Tarzan is critically injured after falling deep inside the storage room where Mangani is held, thanks to Philander cutting the rope Tarzan was holding onto to come down and save Mangani and Porter is captured by Philander's men.\n\nWhen the moon is full, its light generates Mangani's powers when Mangani comes in contact with it; giving him enough power to heal Tarzan. After Tarzan and Porter defeat Philander and his men, Mangani is freed and returns to the jungle to continue healing sick and wounded animals.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nMangani1.jpg\nMangani2.jpg\nMangani3.jpg|Mangani captured by [[Samuel T.
