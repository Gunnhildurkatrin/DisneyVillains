Voiced by [[Sarah Chalke]], she is the coordinator in charge of the North Pole Christmas Eve Command Center for a secret group of elves who prepare for Santa's arrival at homes every Christmas Eve.\n\n==Background==\n===Official Bio===\n''Magee has been the North Pole Christmas Eve Command Center Coordinator for almost 200 years. Before her current post, she proved her managerial prowess as part of Toy Design, where she was credited with streamlining the development pipeline.''\n\n''She assumed her career would be in toys, but [[Santa Claus|the Big Guy]] personally asked her to oversee Prep & Landing as NPCECCC, a role once held by Magee\u2019s own mother.''\n\n''Magee receives a fair amount of unsolicited advice from her mother, especially when it comes to work and romance. Her mother initially held out hope that Wayne and Magee would marry, but the pair dated only briefly and instead became close friends.''\n\n'''''Likes:''' Magee loves egg nog lattes, one after the other. She prefers Yuletide Joe beans, but also enjoys selections from her International Coffee of the Month Club.''\n\n'''''Dislikes:''' Magee doesn\u2019t like when [[Wayne]] offers friendly suggestions on how to better do her job.''\n\n'''''Random Facts:''' Magee makes her own jingle bell jewelry in her spare time (around 3 a.m.), convinced it helps relieve stress. On Wednesdays during off-peak months, Magee teaches Remedial Jewelry Making at the Rec Center.''\n\n''Magee is an avid figure skater, but hasn\u2019t figured out how to skate and make jewelry at the same time yet, but she is determined to find a way.''\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Prep & Landing]]''===\nAs [[Wayne]] is on his way to Magee's office at the NPCECCC, he talks to Magee about his celebration tie to which she tells him that he never received the promotion - only his partner Peterson received it. Explaining that Wayne did train Peterson, Magee tells that Wayne has a new partner to train. Just as Wayne's partner [[Lanny]] enters Magee's office, he introduces himself to Wayne who is excited to be working with him. Upon arriving, Magee escorts the two elves to the last transport reindeer Thrasher for transportation. As Wayne and Lanny are doing their Prep & Landing assignment, Magee sends in backup for Santa to arrive at Timmy's house to deliver the gift he wanted. Throughout Lanny and Wayne's mission, Magee calls Wayne explaining to him about a terrible snowstorm making it difficult for Santa to arrive, to which she calls Santa to help Wayne immediately. She then calls her assistant elf Tiny to call Santa just as Magee plans to help Santa give a perfect route to Timmy's house safe just as Magee plans to cancel Santa's route to Timmy's house. However, Lanny and Wayne manage to help Santa arrive on Timmy\u2019s house so he can deliver the gift to him; the other elves at the NPCECCC celebrate just as Magee faints thinking that cancelling Santa's route was a failure. At the end of the short, Lanny receives a fruitcake from Magee.\n\n===''[[Prep & Landing: Operation: Secret Santa|Operation: Secret Santa]]''===\nMagee has a minor role in this spin-off short where she takes Lanny and Wayne to a \"Silent Night\" operation, wishing them a good luck on their assignment. At the end of the short where Santa shows his wife the first toy made after finding the missing wheel, she and the other NPCECCC elves gaze in awe.\n\n===''[[Prep & Landing: Naughty vs. Nice|Naughty vs. Nice]]''===\nMagee returns in the special where she contacts with Mr. Thistleton who tells her that there has been a large record of nice children this year. She then appears again telling Wayne and Lanny about the new assignment with Thistleton explaining to the two via hologram about a Fruitcake Conduct Calculator. During the assignment, Magee tells Wayne and Lanny that what the two need is an expert elf in handling with naughty children to which the expert elf who the two find is called [[Noel]].\n\nOn their assignment, Noel finds the Fruitcake while Magee notices Grace doing a suspicious action in turning all the nice children into naughty children. Wayne and Noel manage to stop this by placing the Fruitcake on the antenna, just as Magee notices the damage Grace did being reversed. With the problem solved, Magee is later present attending the Elf of the Year awards.\n\n==Trivia== \n\n* According to the intro to \"Operation: Secret Santa\" on the Walt Disney Animation Studios Short Films Collection, Magee is stated to be a caricature of producer Dorothy McKim.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nMagee.png\n</gallery>\n{{Prep & Landing}}\n\n==External links==\n\n*[[w:c:prepandlanding:Magee|Prep & Landing Wiki: {{PAGENAME}}]]\n*[[w:c:christmas-specials:Magee|Christmas Specials Wiki: {{PAGENAME}}]]\n\n[[Category:Prep & Landing characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Elves]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Holiday Figures]]"
