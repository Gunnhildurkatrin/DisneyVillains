Remember, absence makes the heart grow fonder.|Lady Kluck, to [[Maid Marian]] on her love for [[Robin Hood (character)|Robin Hood]]}}\n\n'''Lady Kluck''' is a supporting character in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[1973]] animated feature film, ''[[Robin Hood]]''.\n\n==Background==\nLady Kluck is the lady-in-waiting of [[Maid Marian]]. In contrast to the ladylike Marian, Lady Kluck is very energetic and feisty. This beautiful and kind young woman is very loyal to Marian and advises her on her love for [[Robin Hood (character)|Robin Hood]]. Lady Kluck speaks with a distinct Scottish accent.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Robin Hood (film)|Robin Hood]]''===\nLady Kluck is first seen playing badminton with [[Maid Marian]] on the grounds of [[Prince John's castle]], where she proves to be quite athletic. At one point, when the shuttlecock lands in her dress, she lifts the hem of her dress and \"dances\" around, trying to find it, prompting Marian to tell her she looks so silly. When a group of peasant children appears looking for their arrow, she recognizes the hat of one of the children, a rabbit named [[Skippy (Robin Hood)|Skippy]], to be Robin Hood's hat. When the group role-plays Marian's rescue by Robin, Lady Kluck takes the role of [[Prince John]]. This is a likely indicator of her disdain for him, as she acts pompous and cowardly before Skippy (pretending to be Robin Hood) and then feigns death as she claims Skippy delivered her a fatal sword strike. When an ashamed Skippy asks her if he had hurt her, she tells him he didn't and that this is the part where he \"drags his fair lady off to [[Sherwood Forest]]\" as she continues playing dead. Later, in Marian's chamber, Lady Kluck (while knitting) counsels a lovesick Marian to wait patiently for Robin, expressing her belief that the two will eventually marry and also reminding her that absence makes the heart grow fonder.\n\nLady Kluck next appears at Prince John's archery tournament with Marian, advising her to be on the lookout, as [[Robin Hood (character)|Robin Hood]] will reveal himself to her somehow. When Robin is captured and sentenced to death, Lady Kluck sits in silent tears and attempts to console the despondent Marian. When Robin is released, Lady Kluck, like many others, believe it was due to Marian's pleas, and celebrates. During the fight that ensues, she tells Marian to run, as it is \"no place for a lady.\" Humorously, she fights the guards and the [[Sheriff of Nottingham]] by throwing them and fighting with a confiscated Golden Arrow. She uses the arrow to attack Prince John, who then orders his guards to \"Seize the fat one!\" In a scene reminiscent of an American football game, Lady Kluck defeats all the guards and escapes into Sherwood Forest. At the party that the townspeople hold in the forest to honor the newly-engaged Robin and Marian, she joins in denouncing Prince John. As [[Little John]] plays and sings a [[The Phony King of England|hilarious song]] about Prince John, Lady Kluck dances with him for a short time.\n\nLady Kluck does not appear until the finale, where she is seen crying tears of joy as she watches newlyweds Robin Hood and Maid Marian ride off on their honeymoon in a carriage driven by Little John.\n\n===Cameos===\nIn ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'', Lady Kluck had a cameo at [[Fezziwig]]'s, where she dances with the [[Secretary Bird]] from ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]''.\n\nShe was also seen as one of the guests in ''[[House of Mouse]]''.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Carole Shelley had previously voiced another British bird with white feathers: [[Abigail and Amelia Gabble|Amelia Gabble]] in ''[[The Aristocats]]''.\n*Although Lady Kluck does not wear pants, she treats the feathers on her lower body as if it were such, and while she was attempting to escape the [[Rhino Guards|rhino guards]] in a manner similar to a football player, one grabs her tail feathers, causing them to fall down and revealing a pair of bloomers underneath. So, it's possible that she actually wears pants which look like feathers.\n{{Robin Hood}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kluck, Lady}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Robin Hood characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Chickens]]\n[[Category:Scottish characters]]\n[[Category:Servants]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Mickey's Christmas Carol characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse (TV series) characters]]"
