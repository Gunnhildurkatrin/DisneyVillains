She is a vendor who sells sunglasses to the protagonist [[Paul (Inner Workings)|Paul]] and is his love interest.\n\n==Background==\nNot much is known about Kate, but the attractive, red-haired, grayish blue-eyed vendor is shown to be kind, cheerful and gentle. She is well known for her Junoesque appearance with features such as her slender arms, neck and torso, completed with plump thighs, glutes and hair. Kate wears a slim fit red and white striped crop-top halter shirt, blue jean-shorts, a green baseball-cap (a red baseball-cap in her early designs), emerald dangle earrings that resembles green leaves and green sandals (white sandals in her early designs).\n\n==Role in the short film==\nThe protagonist [[Paul (Inner Workings)|Paul]] first thinks of purchasing neon-blue sunglasses from Kate, but his brain persuades him otherwise, thinking it could cause a chain reaction that would lead to Paul's death causing him to pass. She then looks at Paul curiously because of his strange behavior as he walks away.\n\nLater, when Paul's brain and heart finally agree to stop their rivalry, Paul happily purchases neon-green sunglasses from her as she watches Paul gracefully dive into the ocean, and the end credits showing Paul married Kate\u00a0and had two kids with her.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Early concept art revealed that Kate was originally going to be an office worker at Boring, Boring & Glum whose cubicle was right next to Paul's. Her design was also much more conservative and not curvaceous.<ref>[https://characterdesignreferences.com/art-of-animation-5/art-of-inner-workings Art of Inner Workings]</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"185\">\nSunglasses Vendor.png\nKate (Inner Workings).png\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Kate}}\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Irish characters]]"
