She's a co-news anchor for the ZNN and works alongside her colleague, [[Peter Moosebridge]].\n\n==Role in the [[Zootopia|film]]==\nFabienne Growley makes two appearances in the film. She first appears during the film's climax, announcing the bad news with her co-anchor - another attack involving a predator going savage during the week following [[Judy Hopps]]' announcement, as well as an unfortunate incident at [[Gazelle]]'s peace rally.\n\nGrowley later appears near the end of the film, announcing that [[Bellwether]] is now behind bars after being exposed as the mastermind behind the attacks plaguing [[Zootopia (location)|the city]], while Moosebridge covers [[Mayor Lionheart]]'s denial of said scheme. Growley also mentions that physicians have developed a remedy for the [[night howlers]], and all the predators who have been afflicted are now being treated.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\">\nZootopia-9.png\nzootopia-disneyscreencaps.com-8741.jpg|Growley discussing Judy Hopps' announcement\nPeterMoosebridgeZootopiaNews.png\nPeterMoosebridgeZootopiaNews2.png\nZootopia Night howler cure.png|Growley discussing the remedy for the night howler sickness\n</gallery>\n\n{{Zootopia}}\n\n[[fr:Fabienne Growley]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Zootopia characters]]\n[[Category:Leopards and cheetahs]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:News Reporters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Characters based on real people]]"
