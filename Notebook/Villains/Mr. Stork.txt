He stops on a cloud to check his map and almost loses the bundle ([[Dumbo (character)|Dumbo]]) he was carrying\u00a0by letting it fall through\u00a0the clouds a couple of times. Upon hearing [[Casey Junior|Casey Jr.]]\u00a0(the\u00a0engine pulling the circus train) blow his whistle, he descends onto the moving train and checks a few of the cars, only to find the wrong animal families and be scared by the lions and tigers. He manages to find his way, thanks to the sounds of the elephants from their car, having heard his calls for [[Mrs. Jumbo]]. Once inside, he finds her and delivers his bundle to its expecting mother, reciting two poems. He begins to sing \"Happy Birthday\" to the baby at first, not knowing its name and having to ask for it from his mother. Towards the end of his song, he gets caught by a railroad mail hook and finishes the song on a single drone as the train presses on. He is not seen throughout the rest of the film.\n\n===''[[Lambert the Sheepish Lion]]''===\nHe later appeared in the Disney short ''Lambert the Sheepish Lion'' (albeit in a red uniform instead of blue). Here, he is both the narrator throughout the short and makes an appearance in the beginning. He is first seen delivering lambs to their flock and tells them to go find their mothers. All of the mothers receive a baby except one, and to Mr. Stork's surprise, a baby lion named [[Lambert Lion|Lambert]] was mixed into his delivery. Mr. Stork studies his paper to find where the lion cub belongs and learns (much to his surprise) [[Africa|South Africa]]. Lambert chooses [[Mrs. Sheep|one sheep to be his mother]] after seeing how happy the other lambs are. When Mr. Stork tries to correct it, he is promptly headbutted by Lambert's new mother. He then flies off, saying how rude she was and how this was not part of his job description, but lets her keep the lion cub anyway. He does remain as the story's narrator for the remainder of the short.\n\n===Other appearances===\nIn the [[2019]] [[Dumbo (2019 film)|remake of ''Dumbo'']], Mr. Stork briefly appears in the scene where Dumbo is born to Mrs. Jumbo with a non-speaking cameo. The stork that appears during Dumbo's birth in the aforementioned scene is confirmed to be Mr. Stork in the Easter Eggs on Parade bonus feature. \n\n==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==\n===[[Disneyland]]===\nMr. Stork's likeness can be seen on the ''[[Dumbo the Flying Elephant]]'' ride in [[Disneyland]] In [[Fantasyland (Disneyland)|Fantasyland]].\n\n===[[Walt Disney World]]===\nIn Florida, a figure of Mr. Stork was seen holding Dumbo in the former ''[[Celebrate A Dream Come True Parade]]'' at the [[Magic Kingdom]].\n\n===[[Tokyo Disney Resort]]===\nIn Japan, Mr. Stork can be seen on the signage of the Baby Mine children's store in [[Fantasyland (Tokyo Disneyland)|Fantasyland]] at [[Tokyo Disneyland]]. Inside the shop, a decorative figure of Mr. Stork is displayed near the window (during the park's Easter egg hunts, an egg of [[The Crows|Jim Crow]] is hidden beside Mr. Stork).\n\n==Trivia==\n*Mr. Stork was [[Sterling Holloway]]'s first Disney role. He would later go on to voice characters in numerous Disney animated features in the following decades.\n*Mr. Stork has a cameo in the ''[[Darkwing Duck (Boom! Studios)|Darkwing Duck]]'' story arc \"Campaign Carnage\", working as a janitor at [[St. Canard]]'s mayoral debate.\n*Mr. Stork was a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_stork white stork] cameo with the other [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddle-billed_stork storks], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_skimmer skimmers] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_spoonbill spoonbills] during the song [[Two Worlds]].\n\n==Gallery==\n\n=== Screenshots ===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" orientation=\"none\">\nDumbo-disneyscreencaps.com-560.jpg\nDumbo-disneyscreencaps.com-570.jpg|Mr. Stork carrying a bundle\nDumbo-disneyscreencaps.com-791.jpg\ndumbo 053.jpg|Mr. Stork presenting Dumbo to Mrs. Jumbo\nDumbo-disneyscreencaps com-677.jpg\nDumbo-disneyscreencaps com-696.jpg\nDumbo-disneyscreencaps.com-826.jpg\nDumbo-disneyscreencaps.com-943.jpg|\"Happy birthday, Jumbo Junior...\"\nDumbo-disneyscreencaps.com-961.jpg|Caught on a railroad mail post\nTumblr nuqw9dFmID1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\n52506.jpg|Mr. Stork trying to reclaim Lambert in ''[[Lambert the Sheepish Lion]]''\nCapture d\u2019\u00e9cran 2019-12-25 \u00e0 17.31.43.png|Mr.Stork's cameo in Dumbo (2019)\n</gallery>\n\n=== Miscellaneous ===\n<gallery>\n3496359223 6c222423ff o.jpg|Mr. Stork as seen atop the Dumbo Flying Elephant Ride at Disneyland California\nMr. Stork on the sign for the Baby Mine at Fantasyland from Tokyo Disneyland.jpg|Mr. Stork on the sign for the Baby Mine at Fantasyland from Tokyo Disneyland\n781.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Stock Art===\n<gallery>\nclipdumbostork.gif\ndumbo_stork.gif\ndumbo-stork.png\njumbo_dumbo_stork.gif\n</gallery>\n\n{{Dumbo}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stork}}\n[[es:El Sr. Cig\u00fce\u00f1a]]\n[[fr:Monsieur Cigogne]]\n[[ru:\u041c\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440 \u0410\u0438\u0441\u0442]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Dumbo characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Characters who narrate the story]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Storks]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]"
