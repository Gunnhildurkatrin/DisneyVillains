After seeing the plans of Disneyland, he gave permission to build the park, as long as he is given a home, settling somewhere in Adventureland.\n\n=== [[Tales from Adventureland]] ===\nPatrick Begorra is a major character in the final book, [[Tales from Adventureland: The Doomsday Device|''The Doomsday Device'']]''. ''\n\nLast of the legendary leprechauns, Begorra guards the Eternal Tree, an enchanted date palm also referred to as the Dominguez palm (a reference to the actual oldest tree in Disneyland park). He and the tree are sought out by the Jungle Explorers Society to find a way to counter the ancient Doomsday Device that has fallen into the hands of the villainous Collective.\n\nBegorra only appears to those who pass a series of tests relating to \"the high C's\": ''Courage, Cleverness, and Compassion''. His domain in the roots of the Eternal Tree is guarded by creatures from Celtic lore such as the banshee, the dullahan, and the dearg due.\n\n== [[Disney Parks]] ==\n\n=== Adventureland ===\nIn the wake of the book's popularity, his home was placed onto one of the trees near the [[Jungle Cruise]], though this feature was removed decades later. When ''The Little Man of Disneyland'' was reprinted, his home was reinstalled in a tree at the entrance to [[Indiana Jones Adventure: Temple of the Forbidden Eye|Indiana Jones Adventure]].<ref>[https://d23.com/who-is-the-little-man-of-disneyland/ Who is the Little Man of Disneyland - D23]</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nBegorra's_House.jpg|Begorra's House at Disneyland\n</gallery>\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Leprechauns]]\n[[Category:Irish characters]]\n[[Category:Disneyland]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Tales from Adventureland characters]]\n[[Category:Adventureland]]"
