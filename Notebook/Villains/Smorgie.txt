This primarily involved the addition of new scenes of Witch Hazel's attempts at getting candy from Donald Duck, with Smorgie's role in the story taking up seven of those pages. However, the editors at Dell Comics chose to cut most of Barks' additions to the story out and the Smorgie scenes wouldn't see an official publication until 1986 when the story was completely restored for reprinting in Another Rainbow's Carl Barks Library.\n\n==<!--For classic Disney characters and universes only (i.e. Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck)-->Appearances<!--Include only based on medium of their debut, exc. others into separate sections.

He uses his intimidating size to try and scare Donald into giving him the candy and his six stretchy arms are capable of surrounding the house and entering through all the windows and the chimney to keep Donald from trying to escape with his candy. Donald eventually relents, but he tricks the ogre into taking one last treat with him: A lit stick of dynamite. The explosion reduces Smorgie down to his hat.\n\nSmorgie has since made cameos in various European comic stories.<noinclude>\n</noinclude>\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Carl Barks]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]"
