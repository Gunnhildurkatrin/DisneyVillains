He joins the A.N.T. program and becomes Olive's boyfriend. Graham is also a bit psychotic and tends to yell at Fletcher about adding salt into food or not adding salt on a quail egg. Despite this he seems to be a reasonably\u00a0nice person and has good intentions. However, he goes berserk when\u00a0anyone interferes\u00a0with his\u00a0food in any way, even to the point of holding\u00a0grudges, though he will try to let them go\u00a0after a while.\u00a0After Olive yells at Fletcher for using incorrect grammar, Graham breaks up with her because she yells over grammar. Fletcher comments that he is the one who really yells.\n[[Category:A.N.T.
