He is voiced by series producer [[Jymn Magon]] in his first appearance on the show and by [[Brian Cummings]] in subsequent episodes.\n\n==History==\nArtie Deco is [[Gusto Gummi|Gusto]]'s toucan friend and companion. Presumably, he was born on [[Deserted Island|Gusto's island]], whereupon he befriended Gusto after the Gummi came to island and was subsequently trapped.\n\nIn the episode \"[[My Gummi Lies Over the Ocean]]\", Artie escapes with Gusto, [[Gruffi Gummi|Gruffi]] and [[Tummi Gummi|Tummi]] after his island is destroyed, sinking into the sea, whereupon the four sail off to [[Gummi Glen]]. Artie later moves in with Gusto, when he renovates [[Gusto Falls|an alcove behind a waterfall]], but he stays with the Gummi Glen [[Gummi Bears|Gummies]] during the harsh winter months.\n\nArtie constantly provides Gusto comments on his sculptures and paintings, and rarely stays quiet for too long. Despite his chattiness, he is rather intelligent, as he helps the Gummi Bears with his avian abilities, when their [[Gummiberry Juice]] cannot do the trick.\n\nIn the episode\"[[Day of the Beevilweevils]]\", Gusto leaves Artie with the other Gummie Bears in Gummi Glen, when he goes on a secret adventure with Tummi. When the Gummies learn of this and take Artie along on their rescue mission, they are caught by the [[Tree Folk]] in a cursed forest. Artie manages to escape and attempts to get help. After spotting Tummi and Gusto, he sarcastically remarks to himself \"If I cannot find any help, those two are better than nothing\", and together they rescue their friends.\n\nIn the episode \"[[Top Gum]]\", Artie offers to help Cubbi Gummi master flying with a pair of artificial wings, while at the same time trying to keep his loquaciousness under control (which proves to be a bad idea, as he has secret reservations that Cubbi's flying lessons may indirectly lead to trouble). When they discover the cunning [[Airiels]], Artie is yet again instrumental in saving the day.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=180 spacing=small position=center captionalign=center bordercolor=transparent>\ne19_38.jpg\ne19_91.jpg\ne19_98.jpg\ne16_56.jpg\ne18_43.jpg\nAdventuresOfTheGummiBears-TopGum-CubbiAndArtieFlying02.png\nAdventuresOfTheGummiBears-KingIgthorn-PartII-SirThornberryAndArtie.png\nArtie_guide-name_corrected.jpg\nGustoGummiAndArtieDeco.png\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n* Artie's name is a reference to [[Wikipedia:Art Deco|Art Deco]], a style of visual arts, architecture and design that first appeared in France just before World War I, and in the Disney cartooniverse, heavily influenced the design of [[Cape Suzette]] on ''[[TaleSpin]]''.\n\n{{Adventures of the Gummi Bears}}\n[[Category:Adventures of the Gummi Bears characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Toucans]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
