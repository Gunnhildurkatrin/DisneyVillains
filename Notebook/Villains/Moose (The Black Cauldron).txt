His only appearance is when he ties up [[Fflewddur Fflam]] in the dungeon and then leaves. It is often speculated by fans that he was originally going to have a bigger role in the film.\n\n==Appearance==\nMoose's only appearance in the film is when he ties up Fflewddur Fflam in the dungeon and then looks at Fflewddur with a dumb expression on his face and then leaves.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Although not mentioned in the film, this henchman character is named Moose because the original trailer for ''The Black Cauldron'' that was shown on the 1985 VHS release of ''[[Pinocchio (film)|Pinocchio]] ''confirmed his name.\n*Although there are sources that say that Moose never made it into the film he actually is in the film, although he only appears briefly for a little while.\n*It is often speculated by fans that Moose was originally supposed to have a bigger role in the film. This was to be the case but unfortunately, because of the film's troubled history of production, Moose only showed up in a short brief scene.\u00a0\n*It is unknown what happens to Moose after he ties up Fflewddur and leaves the dungeon. He either escaped the castle from the [[Cauldron Born]], got killed by the Cauldron Born, or died in the explosion of the castle.\n\n{{The Black Cauldron}}\n[[Category:The Black Cauldron characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Presumably Deceased characters]]"
