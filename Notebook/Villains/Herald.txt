He is mostly bald and wears a white wig.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''===\nHe is first seen delivering the invitations to the Royal Ball. He later accompanies the [[The Grand Duke|Grand Duke]] in finding the girl whose foot\u00a0fits into the [[Glass Slipper|glass slipper]]. His job is to carry the slipper, and to try it on the young ladies' feet. When the slipper won't fit [[Anastasia Tremaine|Anastasia]]'s foot, she kicks his head into the piano keys. He also tries to make the slipper fit [[Drizella Tremaine|Drizella]]'s foot, which it doesn't. As he and the Grand Duke are about to leave, [[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]] rushes downstairs to the Duke. [[Lady Tremaine]], in her determination to keep Cinderella from having a happy ending that her own daughters won't have, trips the Herald bearing the glass slipper, causing it to smash. Luckily, Cinderella has the other slipper, which is fitted by the Grand Duke.\n\n===''[[Cinderella III: A Twist in Time]]''===\nHe makes a cameo in the beginning when bringing the slipper to the Tremaine's house, but he doesn't appear throughout the rest of the film.\n\n===[[The Wonderful World of Disney]]===\nHe appeared in the episode [[Disney on Parade (episode)|Disney on Parade]] in the Cinderella section.\n\n=== ''[[Once Upon a Time]]'' ===\nThe Herald appears on ''Once Upon a Time'', episode \"[[The Other Shoe]]\", known\u00a0'''Jacob''' and is portrayed by Max Lloyd-Jones.
