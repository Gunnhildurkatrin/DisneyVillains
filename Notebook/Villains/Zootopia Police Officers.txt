Prior to Judy and Nick's acceptence into the ZPD, all officers were for the most part large prey animals or predators, such as elephants and tigers.\n\n==Role in the film==\nThe Zootopia police officers work to ensure the safety of the citizens.\n\nThe officers are also known to prejudice against prey and other predators based on stereotypes, such as [[Judy Hopps]] who is the first rabbit to join.\n\nBefore their commanding officer, [[Chief Bogo]], makes his debut, they do take in some relaxation such as chatting, arm-wrestling, or checking their phones.\n\nEach officer is assigned a case either with two or three partners, or go solo.\n\nAfter the exposure of [[Bellwether]]'s plot and her arrest, the officers go on equal terms with their co-workers, such as apologizing to [[Clawhauser]], and accepting Judy Hopps and [[Nick Wilde]], the first fox officer.\n\n==Employees==\n<tabber>\n|-|Officer McHorn=\n[[File:Infobox-McHorn.png|left|250px]]\n'''Officer McHorn''' (voiced by Mark \"Rhino\" Smith) is a rhinoceros.\n\nMcHorn seems to show disinterest in those who he deems his lessers, including Judy Hopps. This manifests itself in the way in which he dismisses Judy upon her introduction, as well as when she enters Little Rodentia to chase Duke Weaselton, telling her to \"wait for the real cops\".\n\nWhile it could be argued that this was supposed to be to keep Judy from harm, or even to make sure that Weaselton actually was caught, if she actually heeded his warning, then Weaselton easily could have escaped through Little Rodentia, or worse, larger police officers would have caused more destruction in the rodent town.\n\nThis shows a particularly brash and proud side to his personality. As such, he is portrayed as fairly distant and unlikeable, though to what extent this is true is unknown.\n\nHe was first seen during Judy Hopps' first roll call, as he is sitting next to her for the majority of the time there. She attempts to fist-bump him, but he uses this as a means to push her away.\n\nShortly after, he is assigned by Chief Bogo to search for the Missing Mammals in Sahara Square with Officers Rhinowitz and Wolford.\n\nLater on, as Judy is chasing Duke Weaselton, McHorn's police car skids to a stop just in front of the weasel, and Weaselton uses this as an obstacle to stop his pursuer from continuing the pursuit. McHorn radios the ZPD headquarters, but Judy continues to chase the thief.\n\nAs she enters Little Rodentia, being the only officer that can fit through the small gate, he tells her to wait for \"the real cops\", as he doubts her ability or judgment because she is new to the force.\n{{-}}\n|-|Officer Andersen=\n[[File:Infobox-Andersen.png|left|250px]]\n'''Officer Andersen'''<ref name=\"Elephant\" /> is a polar bear.\n\nAs Judy Hopps walks into the bullpen on her first day as a police officer, Andersen is seen in an arm wrestling contest against Officer Johnson. He ends up pinning the lion's arm to the table, causing laughter from the other officers and surprise from Judy.\n\nHe later cheers along with everyone else when Chief Bogo wishes Officer Pennington a happy birthday.\n{{-}}\n|-|Officer Delgato=\n[[File:InfboxOfficerDelgato.png|left|250px]]\n'''Officer Delgato''' is an African lion.\n\nOn Judy Hopps' first day at the ZPD, Chief Bogo assigns Delgato to the Rainforest District to search for missing residents along with officers Grizzoli and Fangmeyer.\n\nNear the end of the film, on Nick Wilde's first day as an officer, he is assigned to Tundratown SWAT, again with Grizzoli and Fangmeyer.\n\nIn Spanish, ''\"del gato\"'' translates to ''\"of the (male) cat\"''.\n{{-}}\n|-|Officer Fangmeyer=\n[[File:Infobox-Fangmeyer.png|left|250px]]\n'''Officer Fangmeyer'''<ref name=\"CrimeFiles\" /> is a tiger.\n\nDuring the investigation on the 14 missing mammals and on Judy Hopps' first day on the beat, Fangmeyer is assigned with officers Grizzoli and Delgato to the Rainforest District to search for residents missing there.\n\nFollowing the Night howler scandal, and on Nick Wilde's first day on the beat, Fangmeyer is once again assigned with Officers Grizzoli and Delgato, but this time to Tundratown SWAT.\n\nThere was initial confusion over Fangmeyer's species as being a wolf or a tiger. It was then clarified by writer [[Jared Bush]] that at one point during the film's production, Officer Fangmeyer was intended to be the white wolf seen in the force,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/709994080491667457|format=Tweet|date=March 16, 2016|title=@ByronPHoward @jordanolling The named wolves in Zootopia are \"Wolfovitz\" and \"Fangmeyer\" - but his character wasn't named...|author=Bush, Jared|website=Twitter|accessdate=March 16, 2016}}</ref> before the character was shifted to a tiger instead.<ref name=\"Grizzoli\" /><ref name=\"Moore\" /><ref name=\"CrimeFiles\" />\n{{-}}\n|-|Officer Grizzoli=\n[[File:OfficerGrizzoli.jpeg|left|250px]]\n'''Officer Grizzoli'''<ref name=\"Grizzoli\" /> is a polar bear.\n\nOn Judy Hopps' first day at the ZPD, Chief Bogo assigns Grizzoli to the Rainforest District to search for missing residents along with officers Delgato and Fangmeyer.\n\nNear the end of the film, on Nick Wilde's first day as an officer, he is assigned to Tundratown SWAT, again with Delgato and Fangmeyer.\n\nGrizzoli was first visually identified in the game ''[[Zootopia: Crime Files]]'' as a polar bear, although writer Jared Bush has referred to him as \"Grizzoli the Grizzly\", suggesting he is a grizzly bear.\n\nFurther adding to the confusion, the film has Chief Bogo to call Grizzoli, Fangmeyer, and Delgato. A lion, a white wolf and a tiger are then seen getting up and leaving, but no bear.\n\nCo-director Rich Moore has said that Delgato is a lion and Fangmeyer is a tiger (the latter of which is also supported by ''Zootopia: Crime Files''), which would suggest Grizzoli to be the white wolf.\n{{-}}\n|-|Officer Higgins=\n[[File:Officer Higgins.png|left|250px]]\n'''Officer Higgins''' (voiced by [[Raymond S. Persi]]) is a hippo.\n\nHiggins is first seen near the beginning of the film on Judy Hopps' first day on the force checking a clipboard. He announces Chief Bogo's arrival and sits down.\n\nHe is then assigned to Tundratown, along with officers Officer Snarlov and Trunkaby, to search for the mammals that have gone missing there.\n\nNear the end of the film, when Officer Clawhauser returns to his position at the front desk, Higgins and Krumpanski happily welcome him back with boxes of donuts.\n\nDuring Nick Wilde's first day on the force, Higgins, Wolford and Snarlov are seen to put on disguises and leave to do some undercover work.\n\nAfter he announces Chief Bogo's entry, Higgins steps to the side to stand near him. However, a split second later, he is sitting in a chair behind Judy. This fact is confirmed when Bogo calls on him.\n{{-}}\n|-|Officer Jackson=\n[[File:Jackson-New.png|left|250px]]\n'''Officer Jackson''' is a tiger.\n\nWhen Judy Hopps walks in the bull pen on her first day, he is seen watching Officer Johnson arm wrestling with Officer Andersen. He laughs when Anderson pins Johnson's arm down.\n\nAfter Chief Bogo wishes Officer Pennington a happy birthday, Jackson starts playfully punching Pennington's side, provoking the elephant to scoop him up and give him a noogie.\n{{-}}\n|-|Officer Bob Johnson=\n[[File:Infobox-Johnson.png|left|250px]]\n'''Officer Bob Johnson'''<ref name=\"Elephant\" /> is an African lion.\n\nAs Judy Hopps walks into the bullpen on her first day as a police officer, Johnson is seen in an arm wrestling contest against Officer Andersen. He loses as Andersen pins his arm to the table, causing laughter from the other officers and surprise from Judy.\n\nHe later cheers along with everyone else when Chief Bogo wishes Officer Pennington a happy birthday.\n\nHis first name is given in the ''[[Zootopia: The Essential Guide]]''.\n{{-}}\n|-|Officer Krumpanski=\n[[File:InfoboxKrumpanski.png|left|250px]]\n'''Officer Krumpanski''' is a rhino.\n\nKrumpanski is part of the team of officers Chief Bogo takes to the Rainforest District when Judy Hopps calls for backup.\n\nHe watches as Bogo demands that Judy returns her police badge, and as Nick Wilde stands up to Bogo in Judy's defense.\n\nNear the end of the film, when Officer Clawhauser returns to his position at the front desk, Krumpanski and Higgins happily welcome him back with boxes of donuts.\n{{-}}\n|-|Officer Francine Pennington=\n[[File:OfficerPenFrancine.png|left|250px]]\n'''Officer Francine Pennington''' is an African elephant.\n\nFrancine is seen near the beginning of the film when Judy Hopps arrives for her first day as a police officer.\n\nShe is first seen watching Officer Andersen arm wrestle Officer Johnson and laughs when Andersen pins Johnson's arm to the table.\n\nShe appears nervous when Chief Bogo says they need to address the 'elephant in the room', but sighs in relief when she learns Bogo just wants to wish her a happy birthday.\n\nWhen Judy informs the ZPD of the missing mammals at the Cliffside Asylum, she and the other officers arrive for a police raid on the asylum.\n\nNear the end of the film, she and the rest of the ZPD come to the Natural History Museum to arrest Assistant Mayor Bellwether.\n\nDespite Francine's last name being Pennington, Chief Bogo addresses her as \"'''Trunkaby'''\".\n{{-}}\n|-|Officer Snarlov=\n[[File:Infobox-Snarlof.png|left|250px]]\n'''Officer Snarlov''' is a polar bear.\n\nOn Judy Hopps' first day on the force, Chief Bogo assigned Snarlov to look for the missing mammals in Tundratown with Higgins and Officer Trunkaby.\n\nAfter Bellwether's scandal and on the first day of Nick Wilde's assignment to Precinct 1, Chief Bogo placed him on an undercover unit, along Wolford and Higgins.\n\nThe hat Snarlov wears when he heads off to go undercover is the same hat the Muzzled Wolf wears in the latter's promotional video.\n{{-}}\n|-|Officer Bob Trumpet=\n[[File:Screenshot from 2016-06-02 18-12-00.png|left|250px]]\n'''Officer Bob Trumpet''' is an African elephant.\n\nHe is the initial officer that created the case file for Emmitt Otterton, one of the 14 mammals that went missing during the Bellwether Scandal. His name and badge number can be seen on the top right of Otterton's file.\n\nHe is identified in a deleted scene, which displays pictures on his computer. Said pictures show evidence that he is married to an elephant that looks just like Francine Pennington. More pictures show that he has a child, as does a note on the wall that says ''\"DAD\"''.\n\nOfficer Trumpet is seen throughout the movie, usually in the companionship of Officer Francine or his child. He can be seen walking by in the very first trailer for the movie.\n\nHe was possibly at the police training and was also seen in the background while Judy Hopps was chasing Duke Weaselton. Trumpet was possibly at Nick's graduation ceremony with Francine.\n\nTrumpet almost always has a lazy or bored expression on his face.\n\nIn a screenshot of a deleted scene, Trumpet has a picture of concept art of himself.\n{{-}}\n|-|Office Wolford=\n[[File:Wolford Infobox.png|left|250px]]\n'''Officer Wolford''' is a timber wolf.\n\nDuring the investigation on the 14 missing mammals and on Judy Hopps' first day on the beat, Wolford was assigned with Officers McHorn and Rhinowitz to Sahara Square to search for the residents missing there.\n\nAfter Bellwether's scandal and on the first day of Nick Wilde's assignment to Precinct 1, Chief Bogo placed Wolford on an undercover unit, alongside Snarlov and Higgins, where they would be disguised as a sheep.\n\nWhen Wolford dresses up in a sheep's costume, it is a reference to the term \"wolf in sheep's clothing\".\n{{-}}\n</tabber>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Zootopia}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Rhinoceroses]]\n[[Category:Hippopotamuses]]\n[[Category:Elephants]]\n[[Category:Bears]]\n[[Category:Wolves]]\n[[Category:Tigers]]\n[[Category:Lions]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Zootopia characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Police officers]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]"
