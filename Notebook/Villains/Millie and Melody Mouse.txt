Although they can be full of mischief, they are sweet, just like their aunt. They are the female counterparts of [[Mickey Mouse]]'s nephews [[Morty and Ferdie Fieldmouse]].\n\n==History==\nThe only known speculative theatrical film appearance of either of Minnie's nieces is in [[1983]]'s ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'', where Mickey Mouse, as [[Bob Cratchit]], has a daughter. In this film, Morty and Ferdie are said to have played Cratchit's 2 sons (including one as [[Tiny Tim]]), and since Melody seems to be the most consistent name used for any niece attributed to Minnie, it is quite likely that it was Melody who played the role of Bob Cratchit's daughter.\n\nIn [[2011]], the twins would co-star in the [[Disney Junior]] series, ''[[Minnie's Bow-Toons]]''. They first appeared in the episode \"Trouble Times Two\" where they visit Minnie and are shown to be crafty troublemakers.\n\n==Animated Appearances==\n===''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]''===\nThe first animated appearance of either of the girls is ''Mickey's Christmas Carol'', in which one of them plays the daughter of Bob and Emily Cratchit ([[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Minnie Mouse]]).\n\n===''[[Minnie's Bow-Toons]]''===\nHere, they first appear in the episode \"Trouble Times Two\". They've made semi-regular appearances since.\n\n===''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]''===\nIn ''Mickey Mouse Clubhouse'', they first appeared in the special \"[[Minnie's Winter Bow Show]]\".\n\n===''[[Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures]]''===\nThe twins appeared in the ''Roadster Racers/Mixed-Up Adventures'' series, helping their aunt as assistants in the Happy Helpers business.\n\n==Comics==\nWhile Millie and Melody made appearances in the comics, they only had a handful of them while the rest of the kids made more appearances in the comics.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n* Millie and Melody made very few appearances in the comics and more appearances in the TV series.\n\n{{Mickey Mouse & Friends}}\n{{Mickey Mouse Works}}\n{{Mickey Mouse Clubhouse}}\n{{Mickey and the Roadster Racers}}\n{{Inducks character}}\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Mice]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Minnie's Bow-Toons characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:Twins and Triplets]]\n[[Category:Nieces]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Mickey's Christmas Carol characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse Works characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse Clubhouse characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey and the Roadster Racers characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]"
