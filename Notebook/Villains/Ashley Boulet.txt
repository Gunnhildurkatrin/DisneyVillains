She is primarily interested in fashion and gossip. She met the other Ashleys one day in kindergarten at a playground, where all their hats were blown off their heads, and when they tried to get them, they bumped into each other and introduced themselves, becoming friends. Since then, the anniversary of when they first met has been known as \"Purple Day\", as the girls all wore purple when they met, and thus only purple can be worn on \"Purple Day\". When [[Ashley Armbruster|Ashley A]]. accidentally forgot to wear purple on that day, Ashley B. kicked her out of the clique and quickly took over leadership position. Though by the end of the episode, they made up.\n\nAshley B. is considered the closest to Ashley A., as they're usually seen together more often than the other Ashleys. She has also shown to be quite nice in certain situations as well.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Her voice actress, [[Francesca Marie Smith|Francesca Smith]], and Ashley Armbruster's voice actress, [[Anndi McAfee]], are also known for doing best friends Helga Pataki (Smith) and Phoebe Herderyl (McAfee) on Nickelodeon's ''Hey Arnold!, ''which series creators [[Paul Germain]] and [[Joe Ansolabehere]] worked on the first season before leaving for The Walt Disney Company.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nAshley_B..png|Ashley B.\nchar_31517_thumb.jpg|Ten-year-old Ashley B. in ''Recess: Taking the Fifth Grade''\nchar_32651_thumb.jpg|Five-year-old Ashley B. in ''Recess: All Growed Down''\nB0.jpg\nB33.jpg\nB35.jpg\nB46.jpg\nB56.jpg\nB66.jpg\nB76.jpg\nB85.jpg\nB55.jpg\nAshley_B_-_0001.jpg\n68589438989238239.jpg\n039323823289392833.jpg\n29030930939039030.jpg\n0322353.jpg\nvlcsnap-2014-04-01-21h33m08s162.png\nvlcsnap-2014-04-01-19h47m43s92.png\nvlcsnap-2014-04-01-19h48m04s103.png\nvlcsnap-2014-11-28-22h57m22s138.png\nvlcsnap-2014-11-29-11h58m53s151.png\nvlcsnap-2014-11-29-12h04m29s193.png\nvlcsnap-2014-11-29-12h05m26s5.png\nvlcsnap-2014-11-29-20h21m05s108.png\nvlcsnap-2014-11-29-20h25m21s172.png\nvlcsnap-2014-11-29-20h25m45s143.png\nvlcsnap-2014-11-29-22h02m40s188.png\nvlcsnap-2014-11-29-22h04m11s89.png\nvlcsnap-2014-11-29-22h04m26s221.png\nvlcsnap-2014-11-29-22h11m31s129.png\nvlcsnap-2014-11-29-22h11m48s38.png\nvlcsnap-2014-11-29-22h20m37s193.png\nvlcsnap-2014-11-29-22h22m30s53.png\nvlcsnap-2014-11-29-22h30m24s167.png\nvlcsnap-2014-11-29-22h16m52s12.png\nvlcsnap-2014-11-29-22h17m25s66.png\nvlcsnap-2014-11-29-22h18m16s77.png\nvlcsnap-2014-11-29-22h30m47s156.png\nvlcsnap-2014-11-29-22h31m20s235.png\nvlcsnap-2014-11-29-22h31m24s34.png\nvlcsnap-2014-11-29-22h35m22s96.png\nvlcsnap-2014-11-29-22h37m07s116.png\nvlcsnap-2014-11-29-22h37m14s196.png\nvlcsnap-2014-11-29-22h41m50s147.png\nvlcsnap-2014-11-29-22h43m02s92.png\nvlcsnap-2014-11-29-22h47m50s156.png\nvlcsnap-2014-11-29-23h25m23s117.png\nvlcsnap-2014-11-29-23h27m48s73.png\n</gallery>\n==References==\n<references />\n==See also==\n*[[Ashley Armbruster]]\n*[[Ashley Quinlan]]\n*[[Ashley Tomossian]]\n\n{{Recess}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Boulet, Ashley}}\n[[Category:Recess characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Cheerleaders]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:American characters]]"
