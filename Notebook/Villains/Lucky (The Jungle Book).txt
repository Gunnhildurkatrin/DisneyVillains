He laughs very hard at his own jokes, while his own life is at risk, but he doesn't realize it because the lights are all on upstairs, but no one's there.\n\n==Role in the [[The Jungle Book 2|film]]==\nLucky is a new vulture who arrives in the jungle and joins [[Buzzie, Flaps, Ziggy, and Dizzy]]. When we are first introduced to Lucky, the other vultures point [[Shere Khan]] out to him and he starts making fun of the tiger. Soon, the vultures meet Shere Khan again at the swamp, and Lucky foolishly reveals where Mowgli is and starts to make fun of Shere Khan again, but Shere Khan grabs him by the throat and viciously mauls him offscreen as Buzzy, Flaps, Ziggy, and Dizzy fly away frightened. Later on, when [[Mowgli]], [[Shanti]], and [[Baloo]] trap Shere Khan in the mouth of a tiger statue, Lucky, who is revealed to have survived Shere Khan's attack with a bruised eye and most of his feathers gone, appears and makes fun of the tiger all over again.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink|Lucky (The Jungle Book)/Gallery}}\n==Trivia==\n\n* As shown in concept art for ''The Jungle Book'', there would have originally been a fifth vulture named \"Beaky\", but he was dropped.\n** Coincidentally, the original Beatles had a fifth member in the form of Pete Best, before he was replaced by Ringo Starr\n* Much like how the original four vultures have hairstyles based on the Beatles, Lucky's hair-style mimics Phil Collins' balding hairstyle.\n* He is similar to the Flamingo from ''Fantasia 2000''.\n{{The Jungle Book}}\n[[ar:\u0644\u0642\u0637\u0629]]\n[[es:Lucky (The Jungle Book)]]\n[[nl:Lucky]]\n[[pt-br:Lucky (Mogli - O Menino Lobo)]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:The Jungle Book characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Vultures]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
