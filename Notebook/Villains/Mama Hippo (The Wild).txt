She does, however, have a child, baby hippo, with no official gender based on Ryan calling the child a \"little fella\" while the child having a girlish voice and long girl like eyelashes. Mama Hippo is shown to be extremely protective of her baby, with her using her own large butt to protect her child from Ryan, who she misunderstood him as a vicious predator that's after to eat her baby. Based on this, it is assumed that she can be tough, but as well a very loving and caring mother who will do anything to protect her baby from harm.\n\n==Appearances==\n===[[The Wild]]===\nHer only appearance in the film is when she sees [[Ryan]] next to her baby, and assumes he's there to eat her child, as she then begins to attack Ryan with her own huge butt, which scares him away. It's assumed why she uses her own butt as a form of attack is because of how big and large her butt is, which makes it easier to crush the predators who want to harm her and her baby.\n\nWhile she's not seen again in the film, it is assumed that she and her baby were also rescued by the \"Zoo to Africa Rescue Program\" from the large volcanic eruption on the island that she and many other animals were living on. She and her baby presumably are now living at the [[Central Park Zoo]] in [[New York City]] along with the other main characters in the film.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* While ''[[The Wild]]'' film is heavily criticized for being a copy of ''Madagascar'', it also shares the strange similarity of a female hippo using her own butt as a mean of self defense. Mama Hippo in the film uses her own butt to crush predators, which is exactly what ''Gloria the Hippo'' does in ''Madagascar'' when she uses her butt to crush the fossas. Another strange coincidence to ''Madagascar'' is that hippos in their each respected universes are the only animals to have visible butt cheeks. \n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Mama Hippo 1.jpg|Mama Hippo and Baby Hippo\nFile:Mama Hippo 3.jpg\nFile:Mama Hippo 4.jpg|Mama Hippo Scaring Of Ryan\nFile:Mama Hippo 5 .jpg\nFile:Mama Hippo 6.jpg\nFile:Mama Hippo 7.jpg\nFile:Mama Hippo 8.jpg\nFile:Mama Hippo's Butt.jpg|Mama Hippo's Butt\nFile:Mama Hippo 9.jpg\nFile:Mama Hippo 10.jpg|Mama Hippo's Butt Trying to crush Ryan\nFile:Mama Hippo 11.jpg\nFile:Mama Hippo 12.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Hippopotamuses]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Zoo Animals]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:The Wild characters]]"
