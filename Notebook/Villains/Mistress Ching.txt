She is a blind woman who serves as the Pirate Lord of the Pacific Ocean.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]''===\nChing instilled a strict code of conduct among her crew: no stealing from villagers, no deserting, and no taking women as prisoners. Failure to follow these rules would result in death by decapitation.\n\nChing was one of the [[Brethren Court|Nine Pirate Lords]], and although she voted for herself just like all the rest, she openly supported fighting the [[East India Trading Company]] once [[Elizabeth Swann]] became the Pirate King. She fought both the East India Trading Company and [[Davy Jones]]' crewmen, and she celebrated among everyone else once the battle was over and [[Cutler Beckett|Lord Cutler Beckett]] is defeated for good.\n\n==Other Appearances==\n===The Price of Freedom===\nChing was one of the pirate-lords assembled in this book to deal with a group of rogue pirates. She votes in the book for the court to summon Davy Jones for assistance.\n===[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (video game)|Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (video game)]]===\nIn this video-game, she and Villanueva are encountered at a brothel. She engaged the villainous [[Eduardo Villanueva|Captain Villanueva]] in battle, since Villanueva was keeping [[Jack Sparrow]] from attending the Brethen Court. After a fierce battle, Villanueva knocked Ching's head against a gong, knocking Ching out.\n\n==Trivia==\n*''Mistress'' Ching is based on the historic ''Madame'' Ching AKA Ching Shih (1775-1844). The historic Ching is renowned for being the single most successful pirate in recorded history; having commanded an enormous fleet of hundreds of ships and tens of thousands of men, dwarfing the navy fleets of several countries. She was an expert swordswoman, a brilliant businesswoman, and a skilled strategist.\n**The Pirates of the Caribbean films are set decades before the historic Ching Shih would have been born with Mistress Ching's character in practice serving as an easter-egg.\n**Older drafts for the film would have included famous pirates such as [[Blackbeard]], [[Anne Bonny]], Calico Jack Rackham and possibly [[Captain Hook]]. While these were scrapped, Ching's reference remains.\n**Ching being found working at a brothel in the video-game could be an allusion to how the historic Madame Ching was originally a prostitute who came into ownership of her own brothels.\n\n==External links==\n*[https://pirates.fandom.com/wiki/Ching Mistress Ching] on [https://pirates.fandom.com/wiki/ Pirates of the Caribbean Wiki].\n\n{{Pirates of the Caribbean}}\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Pirates of the Caribbean characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Captains]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Chinese characters]]\n[[Category:Martial Artists]]\n[[Category:Characters with disabilities]]\n[[Category:Characters based on real people]]\n[[Category:Lords]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Warriors]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Sailors]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
