He is George's loyal toucan messenger and alerts him with his call, \"Awk awk, Eek Eek, Tookie Tookie!\"\n\n==Trivia==\n*One of the trailers for the first movie showed Tookie taking a plane, but that scene was cut from this movie and moved to the sequel, [[George of the Jungle 2]] as a thought Tookie had as he flew past a plane.\n*Like most of the animals in both films, toucans like Tookie aren't actually found in Africa (they live in the Neotropics).\n*In the original cartoon, Tookie Tookie's bird species was never actually identified and he was purple in color.\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n{{George of the Jungle}}\n[[Category:George of the Jungle characters]]\n[[Category:African characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Toucans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
