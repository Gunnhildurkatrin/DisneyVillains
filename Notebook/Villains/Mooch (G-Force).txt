He serves as the team's eye in the sky and is voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]].\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[G-Force]]''===\nMooch is like all other flies, except that he was made by Ben, so he is sort of like a robot fly. He serves as the G-Force team's surveillance specialist. In the beginning of the movie, Mooch is seen using a sensor device to spy on [[Leonard Saber]] and his Clusterstorm project. Mooch is later seen when he was trying to wake up Ben to tell him where [[Darwin]], [[Juarez]], and [[Blaster]] were. Ben thought that Mooch was an ordinary fly, and he nearly squished Mooch by accident before realizing who the fly was. Mooch assists Darwin by giving him the virus-infected PDA, which [[Speckles]] uses to shut down his deadly Saberling robot that he created by the other Saberling Appliances. Mooch is last seen celebrating with the guinea pigs on a successful mission.\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Mooch}}\n{{G-Force}}\n[[Category:G-Force characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Flies]]\n[[Category:Males]]"
