Only knowing Ned through reading about his adventures, he ended up being selected as his grandfather's heir/successor in an effort to build up the \"Lostmore Spirit\" of adventure inside of him.\n\n== Trivia ==\n\n* Andy's surname is an homage to historic explorer Sir Henry Morton Stanley, most famous for uttering the line, \"Dr. Livingston, I presume\" in his meeting with the more famous missionary David Livingstone.  This line is frequently homaged and satirized in [[Jungle Cruise]] media with Sir Stanley and Dr. Livingston even being mentioned by [[Albert Awol]] in the [[Magic Kingdom]]'s ride queue.\n\n[[Category:Tales from Adventureland characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]"
