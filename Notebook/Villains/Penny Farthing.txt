As an\u00a0English\u00a0actress, she is known for portraying\u00a0Hermione Granger\u00a0in the\u00a0original West End production\u00a0of\u00a0''Harry Potter and the Cursed Child''.\n\n==Role in the film==\nPenny is first seen when [[Jane Banks]] and her brother, [[Michael Banks|Michael]], enter the bank just as Wilkins remembers the jar of sweets on her desk which used to have toffee in it just as they follow him into his office. She later appears when Michael's children, [[John Banks|John]], [[Annabel Banks|Annabel]], and [[Georgie Banks|Georgie]], explore the bank while [[Mary Poppins (character)|Mary Poppins]] waits to talk to Wilkins. Encountering Penny, they ask her for a sweet to which she agrees. She then talks to Wilkins who asks her to give him tea to which she agrees. Afterwards, it is unknown what happened to her after the Banks family got their home back, though it is possible that she remains the secretary.\n\n{{Mary Poppins}}\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Mary Poppins characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:English characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
