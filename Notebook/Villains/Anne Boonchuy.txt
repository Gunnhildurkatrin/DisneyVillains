So, whatever I put on, I just want to be able to see the same me looking back.|Anne finally comfortable about herself.|Bessie & MicroAngelo}}\n'''Anne Savisa Boonchuy''' is the protagonist of the [[2019]] [[Disney Channel]] animated series ''[[Amphibia]]''. She is a 13-year-old Thai-American girl, who originally resided on Earth until a [[Calamity Box|magical music box]] transported her to [[Amphibia (location)|Amphibia]]. In this new world, Anne befriends a family of anthropomorphic frogs who aid her on a quest to find her missing friends and return home. She represents the sapphire of heart on the Calamity Box.\n\n==Background==\nAnne comes from a Thai-American family from Los Angeles, California. She was friends with two girls named [[Sasha Waybright|Sasha]] and [[Marcy Wu|Marcy]]. As shown in \"[[Marcy at the Gates]]\" Anne and Marcy appear to have a good friendship as Anne would constantly protect Marcy from dangers, but in \"[[Best Fronds]]\" and later in [[Reunion (Amphibia)|\"Reunion\"]] revealed that her other friend Sasha was really taking advantage of her, as she claims that one must do anything a friend wants one to do to keep the friendship alive, whether one wants to do it or not. One day, on her 13th birthday her \"friend\" Sasha convinced her to ditch school, and later forced her to steal a mysterious box from a store. Once Anne opened it, she along with Sasha and Marcy were transported to [[Amphibia (location)|Amphibia]], a world with anthropomorphic frogs and dangerous creatures. For some time, Anne was forced to live in a cave, which was very unpleasant for her, especially at night (as giant creatures tried to eat her). Ever since Anne met [[Sprig Plantar|Sprig]] she has gone on one crazy adventure after another and has found a true friend in the silly young frog.\n\n===Personality===\nAnne is described as fearless and self-centered. She also has a rebellious side, as shown in the second segment of the first episode where she and Sprig defy Hop Pop's orders to stay put and instead go to the lake to swim. Anne is shown to have a zany side; a good example are her interactions with Sprig and anyone else she is really close to. She is also very energetic witch has got her both in and out of trouble. Anne started off as a slightly conceited girl who nevertheless embraced her ethnic roots. Anne is a pop-culture enthusiast with a love for young-adult movies and TV shows. Like most teenagers, Anne is obsessed with her phone, often watching shows and playing games on it. In spite of her recklessness, Anne can often deliver good advice. This is seen in both \"[[Grubhog Day]]\", where she advises Sprig to tell Hop Pop that he doesn't want to take care of the grubhog, and \"[[Cursed!]]\", where she tells Sprig to just break his engagement with Maddie due to his fear of her. \n\n[[File:Marcy at the Gates - Anne, Sasha and Marcy on Sports Class.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Anne protecting Marcy from a volleyball.]]\nAnne deeply values her friends, feeling lost if she doesn't have one, and is ready to do anything to protect both her friends and her friendships with them. However, this latter trait is a double-edged sword, as it causes her to save her friends in Amphibia even if she knows she may die while doing it. Anne was also manipulated by her \"friends\" on Earth to get what they wanted, although it was mostly with Sasha. Due to her relationship with Sprig, she has discovered what true friendship is and has continued to develop strong bonds with her new friends in Amphibia. Also, Anne realizes the bad side of her friendship with Sasha through Sprig's encouragement and faith in who she really is. Anne also deeply cares about her parents and her frog family more then anything else as she tries her best to make them happy.\n\nAt the beginning of the series, Anne was disgusted at the idea of eating bugs but as the series progressed, she has come to really enjoy eating them. When she first realizes this in \"[[Toad Tax]],\" she says \"I've been here too long,\" but by \"[[The Big Bugball Game]]\" the fact that she now likes to eat bugs no longer bothers her as she says, \"Eh, who am I kidding, I'll eat it.\" Anne shows a strong dislike of pineapples, especially as a pizza topping, and will threaten anyone who mentions them.\n\n[[File:Bessie & MicroAngelo-00566.png|250px|thumb|Anne finally liking what she sees in the mirror.]]\nDuring her time in Amphibia, Anne has grown as a person, such as learning to respect teachers, due to disliking them before, the value of being a team player and most importantly she has learned to stand up against what she knows is wrong, like Sasha's behavior. Anne also stops caring about what others think of her. During her quest to find a way home, Anne looks back at her previous selfish behavior and past misdeeds as she learns to take responsibility for her actions. Overall, Anne has slowly matured as the series progressed and her experiences with her surrogate frog family have turned her into a kindhearted and selfless person that loves helping others, even those who treated her badly. At the end of the day, Anne is feisty, peppy and quirky yet sensitive and sweet with a love of adventure and a heart of a true hero. However, Anne has shown to crack under pressure, as shown in the \"[[The First Temple]]\", when Hop Pop kept asking her what he needed to do in order to fix their strain relationship as she tells him that she doesn't know and needs time to sort things out. This was shown again in \"[[Anne-sterminator]]\", when she sees that her mother has high expectations from her and being confronted her about lying as she accused her of still being that same irresponsible little girl that she was before she disappeared to Amphibia then asked her when she gonna grow up, Anne cracks right in front of her parents as she tells them that she doesn't know when she'll be the daughter they want her to be. When Hop Pop and her parents at different times see the pressure they put on her, Anne was given an apology for overwhelming her and she easily forgives them.\n\nEver since she realized how much she been lied, pushed around, tricked and used by Sasha, Anne doesn't take those characteristic well, as shown in \"[[After the Rain]],\" when she got upset with Hop Pop for lying to her ever since she gave him the Calamity Box to hold onto as she accused him of tricking her into keeping her in Amphibia forever and almost left her frog family for good because of this. However, Anne changed her mind about leaving when she hears that Hop Pop's intentions were protecting those he cares about then seeing him show deep remorses for betraying and hurting her trust. This was shown again in \"[[True Colors (Amphibia)|True Colors]],\" when Sasha tells Anne that she was just using her and Marcy to gain access to Newtopia for a Toad invasion, which led her to call her out for her actions. Also, in the same episode, Anne was shocked and hurt that Marcy not only tricked her alongside Sasha into stealing the Calamity Box but also for stranding them in Amphibia on purpose. Due to being betrayed, lied, pushed around, used and tricked one too many times, Anne has shown to have some trust issue with Hop Pop, Sasha, Marcy and others who mistreat her. Also, after retuning home, Anne wasn't sure about trusting other humans, excluding her parents, as she fears being betrayed, lied, pushed around, tricked and used again.   \n\nHowever, despite her trust issues, Anne still cares about Hop Pop as she doesn't want to hurt him for any reasons and wants to fix things between them, which seems to be back on the right track. Anne also feels the same way about Sasha as she knows what is like to make selfish choices and mistakes. In addition, Anne has those same feelings about Marcy as she may have taken her and Sasha away from their lives but does understands that she never meant to put either of them in danger like that. After discovering King Andrias true nature and returning home, Anne's main focus is to not only go back to Amphibia to stop the king's mad plans for dimensional conquest but also bring Marcy and Sasha home. Anne still trusts her parents, Sprig, Polly, Bessie, Frobo, MicroAngelo, the citizens of Wartwood and Newtopia. Also, overtime, Anne starts trusting other humans beside her parents again, as shown in \"[[Fight at the Museum]],\" when she tells [[Dr. Jan]] about her experience in Amphibia with Hop Pop's permission and encouragement. This was shown again in [[Temple Frogs|the next episode]], when some longtime friends at the Tai Temple helped her and her family fight some smaller robots sent by the [[Cloak-Bot]] as they even promise to keep the existences of her frog family a secret, after their disguises were removed during the fight.\n\nEver since Hop Pop told her what happened to Sprig and Polly's parents and the events of \"[[True Colors (Amphibia)|True Colors]],\" Anne has become protective of both her parents and her frog family as she doesn't want anything to happen to them, as shown in \"[[The New Normal]],\" when she doesn't want to tell her parents that King Andrias is after her, her Calamity Box powers, Sasha's selfish actions and that Marcy was responsible for stranding them in Amphibia. Anne is not only trying to protect both her families but also fears what her parents would think about the situation. Also, in the same episode, after her mother suggested in having the authorities take the Plantars, Anne said no in that idea as she knows that her frog family will be taken away from her and experiment on as she promises them that she'll keep them safe no matter what. Although, in \"[[Anne-sterminator]]\", after her parents commented on her maturity and honesty, Anne feels remorses for not telling them everything about her time in Amphibia as she not only decided to tell them truth but also didn't wanna lie to them anymore. However, before she could say anything, Anne and both her families were found by the Cloak-Bot. When confronted by her parents for lying to them, Anne apologizes to them as she admits that she did lie but did it to protect them and the Plantars. Although she appreciate their help in defeating the Cloak-Bot once and for all, Anne is still unsure in involving them in further of her inter-dimensional stuff. However, after her parents helped her and the Plantars escape from [[Mr. X (character)|Mr. X]], Anne realized that she misjudged them and apologizes to them for underestimating them, which they accepted.\n\n===Physical appearance===\n\n<gallery>\nProfile - Anne Boonchuy.png|Anne in seasons 1 & 2.\nAnne Boonchuy in Gold Armor.png|Anne in Armor\nAnne Boonchuy S3.PNG|Anne in season 3\n</gallery>\nAnne is a tall, slender girl of Thai descent.

In \"[[Handy Anne]],\" her eyes glow more promptly and slightly longer.

In this state her strength and speed are greatly enhanced and she can release huge bursts of energy. After she has used her powers, she will collapse from exhaustion. She has yet to gain control over this amazing power.\n*'''Bird communication (formerly):''' After being cursed by [[Barry]] and turned into a humanoid raven, Anne gained the ability to communicate with birds.

Sasha tended to push Anne around through peer pressure while Marcy was so clumsy that Anne had to look out for her. At some point, she and her friends started a band. At Sasha's behest, Anne abandoned her own birthday party set up by her family to go and steal a [[Calamity Box|mysterious music box]] that Marcy discovered at a thrift store with her friends, although she and Sasha were unaware that Marcy was planning to run away because her dad got a new job out of state along with knowing something about the box. The box transported, Anne to the world of [[Amphibia (location)|Amphibia]] where she spent the first couple of weeks fending for herself in the wild.\n\n===Season One===\n[[File:Flood, Sweat and Tears 25.png|thumb|\"''Spranne against the world!''\"|alt=|250px]]\nUpon meeting the native Amphibians, Anne was taken aback by their way of living. Only when she started living with the Plantars did she begin to open up and learn more about herself. It did not take long to form a bond with each the Planters; [[Sprig Plantar|Sprig]] became a true friend to the human girl, [[Polly Plantar|Polly]] saw Anne as something of role model and [[Hop Pop Plantar|Hop Pop]] gave her many important life lessons. Anne's bond with the Planter family became so strong that they consider each other family and the more adventures they went on the more that bond showed. Anne even discovered parts of herself that she was not aware of such as courage, integrity, humility, loyalty, persistence and compassion.\n\n[[File:Reunion - Hug.png|thumb|left|Anne embracing her surrogate frog family.|alt=|250px]]\nHer relationship with Sasha also begins to unravel as it becomes apparent that much of her decisions were more the result of being pressured and pushed around by her. Her perception of friendship is depicted in \"[[Best Fronds]]\" when she states, \"If a friend likes a pencil case, you get it for them. If your friend likes your new shoes, you give them to her. And if your friend wants you to steal a crazy music box from a thrift store, even if you really don't want to, you do it, okay?\" Through her constant interaction with Sprig, a somewhat simple-minded child, Anne is able to look at friendship in a whole new way. She begins to desire a more compassionate relationship with those close to her. In \"[[Reunion (Amphibia)|Reunion]]\", she finally sees through Sasha's manipulative tactics thanks to Sprig, who sees Anne for who she is: a kind and considerate person who is willing to protect her friends. After Anne defeats Sasha in a duel, [[Toad Tower]] starts to collapse, forcing [[Captain Grime]] to retreat with an unconscious Sasha. After getting back to Wartwood, the Plantars apologize that Anne lost Sasha as a friend, but Anne tells them it is okay because she considers them her family and that as long as they stay together, they'll get through anything.\n\n===Season Two===\n[[File:Marcy at the Gates - Anne and Marcy hold hands.jpg|thumb|Anne puts her trust in Marcy.|250px]]\nAnne and the Plantars set off on a journey to [[Newtopia]] to find Anne's way home; before leaving, Anne's eyes began glowing during a fight with a giant mutant vegetable monster. During their journey they come across an abandoned factory and escape before it collapses; but unbeknownst to them the factory created a [[Frobo|frog-like robot]] just before its destruction; the robot then proceeds to follow Anne and the Plantars. Upon arriving at Newtopia Anne is reunited with Marcy, her other human friend. During a quest to drive away a colony of giant bloodthirsty Barbari-Ants, Anne still thinks Marcy needs protection but learns Marcy can take care of herself now (although Marcy is still a little clumsy). After a successful mission Anne tells Marcy about about her fight with Sasha and they both promise that not only will they work together to get back with Sasha, but find a proper way to get home. Anne and the Plantars meet [[King Andrias]]; while he appears to be a jovial and kindly ruler, he was actuality plotting something involving the human girls.\n\nDuring one of their adventures in Newtopia, Anne and Sprig's bond becomes even stronger after learning about each other's moms. Anne misses her mom so much she would do anything to even hear her \"tone deaf\" singing; she even goes to great lengths to get a gift for her for when she eventually returns to earth and is reunited with her mother. Sprig reveals that his mother passed away when he and Polly were really young, and he doesn't even remember her; as Sprig wonders if you can miss someone without knowing them, Anne gives him a big hug as they both cry.\n\nDuring their sleepover Anne, Sprig, Polly and Marcy venture down to the castle's basement which is strictly off limits, where they encounter some strange things: a flooded tomb full of [[Shadowfish|strange creatures]], two halls of mirrors, a chamber with plants that don't need sunlight to grow and a torn portrait of King Andrias with an unknown [[Unknown Female Frog|frog]] and [[Unknown Toad Warrior|toad]]. The next morning they learn from King Andrias that the music box that transported Anne, Sasha, and Marcy to Amphibia once belonged to his ancestors who used to travel to other worlds. To get the box working again, each of the box's gems need to be recharged at three different temples.\n\nWhen they return to Wartwood Anne learns that Hop Pop lied to her about hiding the music box when it went missing, she was distraught but put her anger aside to work with Hop Pop in order save Sprig and Polly and retrieve the box. After she forgave Hop Pop he showed Anne an old book that has been the Planter Family for ages and from it she learned the music box was called the [[Calamity Box]]. Things were still awkward between Anne and Hop Pop but during their mission at the first temple they agreed to work things out together. With her friend now staying with her at the Planter Farm Anne tires to help Marcy get accepted by the amphibians of Wartwood; she was against Marcy go with [[Mayor Toadstool]]'s plan to turn the town into a tourist attraction and had to help her save everyone when everything began to sink in the swamp. In the end the Wartwood citizens, while still mad did accept Marcy's apology it and let her know that they're slowly starting to like her. Anne then watches as an optimistic Marcy beginning to fix the town without going overboard. The Robot that had been following them and finally caught up and was given the name [[Frobo]] by Polly. The Planters and the human girls decide to take in the mysterious mechanical being.\n\n[[File:Ampibia S2 The 2nd T more info and more Questions.PNG|left|thumb|250px|Valeriana explain things before Anne's trial at the 2nd temple.]]\nDuring their journey to the second temple Anne encountered Valeriana who she previously met at the Bizarre Bazaar. Valeriana reveled that she was part of an ancient order that research the Calamity Box. She put Anne though a series of trials and Anne finally lived up to her pervious selfish actions. After seeing Anne truly learned form her past mistakes and takes responsibility; Valeriana declares that she passed the test. However Anne left before the gem was fully charged to go help Marcy and the Planters. Anne started wearing armor, but just the chest plate becuse she is finally comfortable about who she has become and still wants to see herself in the mirror. At the third and final temple Sasha appeared and saved Anne, the Planters and Marcy then apologized for her misdeeds. Anne was skeptical but allowed her to help with completing their quest. It was only when fighting a giant stone toad guardian in a chamber with intense gravity did Anne put faith in her. After Sasha defeated the guardian and the third stone was recharged Anne decided start things all over with Sasha. However, little did Anne know that Sasha was merely deceiving her to get into Newtopia as part of Grime's Invasion plan.\n\n[[File:No Big Deal From Amphibia.png|thumb|250px|Getting the band back together]]\nAnne, Marcy and the Plantars invite Sasha and Grime over for dinner to bury the hatchet. While things seem nice at first, everyone becomes awkward with one another when they bring up past conflicts. Unable to contain herself, Sasha lashes out at Anne and Marcy for trying to change her. A cake Grime brought turns into a deadly challenge that forces the girls to save everyone. After the battle is over Anne tells her maybe she doesn't want her to change as much she wants Sasha to see that she has changed. Sasha agrees that Anne is no longer the shy girl who she needed to protect back on earth and the two reconcile and then they join everybody in feasting on chocolate covered hornets. Wartwood has been on edge because Sasha and Grime have returned since the Toad Tower incident. So Mayor Toadstool has consulted the wheel of fun to come up with an activity to help relieve some tension and the result was a Battle of the Bands. Immediately, Anne, Marcy, and Sasha want to reunite their former garage band, Sasha and the Sharps. They had some disagreements but but eventually Sasha came around and put on an amazing performance. After the contest (Were Grime won thanks to his 3 hour harp solo) Anne suggests taking a group photo before she, Marcy, and Sasha leave for home, to which everyone in Wartwood joins in.\n\n[[File:Anne & Sasha Rematch S2E20.png|left|thumb|250px|Anne and Sasha's rematch]]\nThe three human girls, the Plantars, Grime and Frobo all arrive at Newtopia with the music box. Sprig is sadden that the adventure is over, but Anne reminds them as long as they have the music box they can see each other any time they wanted. As they entered the throne room Andrias greets them and is delighted they were successful in their mission, but as just as Anne is about to hand the box over to Andrias, it is snatched away by Sasha and Grime who reveal their plan to take over Newtopia as they imprisoned the king and signaled the hidden toad soldiers. Anne is furious that she has been betrayed by Sasha again and refuses to join her. After Sasha fails to figure out how to use the box to send Anne back to earth she orders Anne, Marcy, The Planters, Frobo and [[Lady Olivia]] to be sent to the dungeon. While being escorted down the hall they are rescued by [[General Yunan]] and they regroup at Sal's old sandwich shop (That was featured in \"[[Little Frogtown]]\"). When Marcy informed them that the rest of the Toad army would reach the city in less than an hour the group fell into despair, but Anne motivates them to fight back and comes up with a plan. Hop Pop, Marcy and Olivia would break out Andrias of the dungeon while Polly, Yunan and Frobo engage in a frontal assault on the toads in the city. Meanwhile, Anne herself and Sprig would close the gate to prevent the toad army from entering. Just as they close the gate Sasha arrives to warn her about the dark secret she had learned about King Andrias but Anne ignored her and they began to fight. Anne manages to defeat Sasha by pulling her own cape over her face while Sprig defeats Grime by hitting him with Barrel's Warhammer.\n\n[[File:Super Anne.png|thumb|250px|Anne wielding the power of the blue gem]]\nWhen Anne gave Andrias the box he told everyone present about a time when he was betrayed by his friends, that the music box was stolen from him and no one remembers what Amphibia was like 1,000 years ago, but now that he got the box back he will use i's power to restore Newtopia to glory. Andrias then the revealed that his ancestors were not explorers like he previously said but instead they were \"glorious\" conquerors as he put the music box on a pedestal to power up his castle; enabling it to fly, then he reactivated ancient factories all over Amphibia that created a [[Frog-Bot Army|frog-bot army]] that arrived at the [[Newtopia Castle|castle]] in mere seconds. Andrias then inform everyone to their horror that he was planning on following in his ancestors footsteps by traveling to other worlds and conquering them starting with earth. When Anne and Sasha told the king they would stop him, he decides a demonstration of his power was in order and used his castle's giant laser cannon to destroy a toad tower. Marcy spoke saying this was not part of the plan he told her only for the giant newt to admit he had been deceiving her all this time. When Anne and Sasha asked what they were talking about, Marcy said that Andrias promised to take them to other worlds so the could have more adventures forever; when Anne asked why the mad king informed everyone that Marcy got them stranded in Amphibia on purpose, leaving both Anne and Sasha in disbelief. Marcy admitted she knew about the power of the Calamity Box beforehand and explained that her father got a new job out of state and her family were moving; she wanted to use the box to take the 3 of them to a world to were they would always be to together. Anne is devastated by this revelation because she wonders how Marcy could do such a thing, because how much she missed her family and her life back on earth. Marcy then tried to justify her actions my reminding them of the fun adventure they had, how Anne and Sasha have grown as people in Amphibia and Anne's friendship with Sprig were all because of her, only for Anne to back away in distress, leaving Marcy on her knees crying and saying she just didn't want to be alone. Anne looks around and realizes that while she and her 2 human friends have made a lot of mistakes, what Andrias Leviathan was doing was evil and vows to stop him, rallying her friends together to face the king and his new mechanical army; Sasha decides to redeem herself but for real this time and Marcy pulls herself together as both join the fight, Hop Pop and Grime team up to destroy some of the bots, Yunan protects Oliva after both defected from Andrias, Sprig fends of some bots with his slingshot and Frobo is destroyed while protecting Polly. Just as Polly (who just got her legs) gets the music box back, Andrias grabs Sprig and threatens to drop him from the castle. After the group complies with his demand Anne begs him to release Sprig, but Andrias drops him anyway. The grief caused by this act awakens the power of the blue gemstone within and she furiously fights Andrias while everyone is awestruck at her extraordinary power as she punches Leviathan so hard that she knocks his crown off his head, easily dodge all of her enemies' attacks, destroys the remaining frog-bots, breaks though Andrias' energy shield and knocking the wind out of the king. After Anne powers down, Sprig who was rescued by Marcy runs up to her and she is overjoyed he is alive as her surrogate frog family embrace. Realizing that she can't fully control her power, Andrias manages to pick himself up a decides he can't let Anne live, but Marcy manages to use the Calamity Box to open a portal to earth while Sasha and Grime keeps the king busy. Anne and the Plantars jump through, along with Frobo's head, but when Anne beckons Marcy to come through, Andrias stabs her through the chest with his laser sword. Marcy apologizes for her actions just before collapsing from her injuries and the portal closes. When they come to the Planters ask where they are and Anne solemnly tells them that she is finally home.\n\n=== Season Three ===\nAnne and the Plantars walk through the human girl's neighborhood as the frogs ask what their next move is. Anne afrims her belief that Marcy is alive and vows to find away back to Amphibia to help her and Sasha. They arrive at Anne's house as she dumbfounded that she is about to see her parents again after all this time. She tells the Planters to hide until she gives the signal and decides it not tell her parents yet about King Andrias, how she was betrayed by both Sasha & Marcy and especially keep quiet about her \"Blue Powers\". Anne Knocks on the door as [[Mrs. Boonchuy|Anne's mother]] opens it and as the two see each other her mother tearfully embraces her daughter. Just then [[Mr. Boonchuy|Anne's father]] sees them and joins in the hug. As Anne share an emotional reunion with both of her parents and her cat [[Domino (Amphibia)|Domino]], Hop Pop mistook a bird squawk for Anne's signal and reveals himself, Polly reprimands him for it and Sprig introduces himself.\n\n[[File:Fam Reunion (Amphibia Season 3- Anne is back!).png|left|thumb|250px|Anne happily reunited with her family.]]\nAs Anne's parents are left in shock at the sight of the 3 talking frogs Anne slaps her forehead. Anne puts together a presentation explaining what she has been doing all this time (while Leaving out the events of \"[[True Colors]]\" to prevent more panic). As her parents process everything their daughter said Anne asks if the Frog family can stay; they are reluctant and Mrs. Boonchuy suggest calling the authorities, But Anne is convinced that the government would do horrible experiments to talking frogs and was against it. Seeing how much the Plantars meant to Anne The Boonchuys agrees to let them stay but on lock down. The Boonchuys continue to pamper Anne and she has finally had enough. She demands that she be given space; When Mrs. Boonchuy told them she was leaving to the market Anne asks to come along and promises to disguise the Planters and keep a low profile. After Hop Pop and Mr. Boonchuy point out that Anne is a lot more mature than she use to be Mrs. Boonchuy finally agrees. Anne disguises the Plantars as they head to market. Anne's parents are actually amazed at how responsible their daughter has become and actually agrees to let Anne take the frogs to try the noodles.\n\nAs the Planters are loving the noodles Sprig spots a [[Cloak-Bot|silver Frobot with cloaking tech]] that was sent by King Andrias to eliminate Anne as it grabs her and starts squeezing the girl, but the Sprig manages to distract it and run. Not wanting to alert her parents, Anne and the Plantars pretend like nothing is wrong. Anne turns on loud music to hide any noise they make when fighting. Anne and the Plantars fight the Frog-Bot and realize that it too is trying to remain discreet; with its camouflage tech, incredible strength, and excellent reflexes, the robot proves to be a formidable opponent, yet Anne and her companions manage to trick it into running into a freezer. The Plantars freeze due to being cold blooded and Anne is backed into a corner. After the frozen Planters fall over and distract it, the drone attempts to attack them. Enraged by this Anne unleashes her blue gem power and punches the Silver Frog-Bot so hard it severely damages the machine and it flees to safety. Upon escaping the freezer, Anne collapses and the Plantars use a pungent durian to wake her. The Boonchuys, none the wiser, commend Anne for being responsible and mature as she and the Plantars remain quiet about the incident. Anne decides that she does not want to use her powers unless she needs to as it severely weakens her, plus something about using them feels off.\n[[File:Hop Til You Drop Oh yes please my skin is burning.png|thumb|220x220px|A touching moment ruined thanks to Hop Pop's burning green skin ]]\nAnne and the Plantars go outside to check the mail. However, things quickly get out of hand when Polly almost gets into a fight with other children, Sprig almost falls into a wood chipper, and Hop Hop almost falls for a scam. She decide to take them to Mall to teach them how to not to get distracted or pulled in by something on Earth. It was disastrous but they managed to escape from the chaos. Anne decides to take things slowly when teaching the frogs about her world from now on. When Anne and the Planters went to a museum the found a vase with a picture of a frog and and the Calamity Box; finding their first real clue they are once again attacked Andrias' Frog-Bot Assassin. After driving it away yet again, they decided to enlist the help of their new friend [[Dr. Jan]], who saw them fighting the robot, and the frogs without their disguises. After earning their trust Dr. Jan promises to do some research. Dr.Jan arrived at the the the Thai Temple after Anne and her friends  fought of some killer robotic dragonflies sent by he Cloak-Bot and revealed the hidden message  on the vase \"Seek the Mother of Olms she will guide you to your destiny\", but nobody knew what that meant.\n[[File:Anne-sterminator (31).jpg|thumb|220x220px|Anne punching [[Cloak-Bot]] into orbit.|alt=|left]]\nAt the Boonchuy residence, Anne is amazing everyone by doing the laundry, taking out the trash, washing the dishes and using a coaster all at breakneck speed. After her parents tell her how proud of them they are of her new responsible behavior, Anne drags Sprig into the kitchen to tell him she can\u2019t keep the secret about Andrias anymore and decided to tell her parents, just as the Cloak-Bot Attacks them. As the robot chase them down the highway, Anne gets a little upset with Hop-Pop when he inadvertently tells the Boonchuys that this was not the first time the robots has been after them. After briefly evading Cloak-Bot, the families made their way to a junkyard where Mrs. Boonchuy explodes into anger for Anne keeping secrets, while she rebuffs her by saying she lied because she wanted to keep her loved ones safe and she was on a lot of pressure from her parents about becoming the daughter she and her husband wanted her to be, which stunned them. Just as the Cloak-Bot catches up to them, Anne asks her mom to uses her artistic skills to create a bunch of fake hers out of junk yard to confuse and distract the Cloak-Bot long enough for everyone to severally damage it. As a last ditch effort the Cloak-Bot decided  to kill everyone with its Self-Deduct sequence, but Anne uses her powers to knock into orbit before it explodes, which astonishes her parents. After powering down, Anne says she has so much to tell her parents before she passes out. As they drive home, Anne is unconscious as her mother, who now understands the kind of pressure she's been putting on her, comforts her as she tells the frogs that she now knows she was just trying to keep them all safe and promises that the Boonchuy family will help the Planter family however they can. Anne was worried of involving her parents in more adventures but after they help her and the Plantars escape the clutches of [[Mr. X (character)|Mr. X]] she apologizing for misjudging them.\n\n==Relationships==\n{{Relationshipslink}}\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Anne is the first Thai-American protagonist in an animated series in history.\n*Anne is shown to be highly addicted to her phone, with Polly noting she never goes anywhere without her phone in \"[[A Night at the Inn]]\". She is more grateful to Wally for saving her phone than her life in \"[[Wally and Anne]]\". A brief comment of hers in \"[[Taking Charge]]\" suggests this addiction is due to her phone being the only link to her life back home.\n**On a related note, it is strongly implied that Anne is very responsible with the use of her phone, since she spent days in Amphibia with her phone still at full charge until Hop Pop drained it all in the episode \"[[Taking Charge]]\".\n* Anne's blue-gem powered form is visually similar to the Super Saiyan Blue form present in the ''Dragon Ball'' franchise. However, the form being triggered by anger makes her blue-powered form more similar to the original Super Saiyan form. \n*She attends Saint James Middle School, which seems to be a parochial school. Concept art for the character showed her wearing a Catholic school-style vest. However the episode \"[[Temple Frogs]]\" reveals Anne and her family to be Buddhists.\n*It is strongly implied in \"[[Family Fishing Trip]]\" that Anne likes to eat crab, as she says that the giant crab monster both scares her and makes her hungry. She later asks if anyone would like to go and kill the crab monsters, arguing that \"that thing probably had a ton of meat.\"\n*Strangely enough, despite showing that she can get clean and has worn clean clothing and combed or slicked her hair on more than one occasion, her hair always seems to revert back to having leaves and sticks in it as if she has been dragged through the woods. According to [[Matt Braly]], this is done on purpose in order to reflect the fact that \"[Anne] is out of her depth and a bit disoriented [in Amphibia]\".<ref>[http://www.bsckids.com/2019/06/talking-amphibia-on-disney-channel-with-matt-braly-exclusive/amp/ Talking Amphibia On Disney Channel With Matt Braly \u2013 Exclusive]\n</ref> Anne finally noticed this in the episode \"[[The Sleepover to End All Sleepovers]]\".\n**In the ''Amphibiland'' pilot short, Anne is depicted with both of her shoes intact.\n*Anne was originally envisioned as being boring on Earth before being reinvented by the crew. Her personality was loosely based on [[Pacifica Northwest]] from ''[[Gravity Falls]]'' and Matt Braly's grandmother when she was a younger.\n*Matt Braly revealed on an AMA that Anne's design was slightly influenced by [[Pepper Ann Pearson|Pepper Ann]], as Braly was a fan of the [[Pepper Ann|series]].<ref>[https://twitter.com/DisneySchedules/status/1297566885278613510 Pepper Ann Twitter Post]</ref>\n*Anne's last name \"Boonchuy\" roughly translates to \"one who encourages or performs good deeds.\" This fits her character as she attempts to help the people of Amphibia.\n*Anne has shown a number of interesting talents over the course of the series such as cooking, dancing, dunking, and sewing. It is implied that she learned some of these skills either through her family or her friends.\n*Some of Anne's quips such as her saying \"Obvi\", which is short for \"Obviously\", most likely came from Sasha, showing the influence that she has had on her.\n*In \"[[Reunion (Amphibia)|Reunion]]\", it is revealed that Anne used to hate frogs to the point that Sasha would make fun of her for it and try to gross her out.\n*According to Matt Braly, Anne reads manga, \"[probably saw] anime\", and watched ''The Lord of the Rings''.<ref>[http://culturageek.com.ar/matt-braly-amphibia/ Matt Braly, creador de Amphibia y Gravity Falls: \"Siempre quise crear mi propia fantas\u00eda\" (in Spanish)]</ref> This is further supported in the episode \"[[Trip to the Archives]]\", where Anne shouts \"Zoobooks and manga, here I come!\".\n*As seen in \"[[Quarreler's Pass]],\" Anne apparently does not like to talk about her potential romantic life at home.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[[w:c:amphibiapedia:Anne Boonchuy|Anne Boonchuy]] at the [[w:c:amphibiapedia|Amphibia Wiki]]\n*[https://hero.fandom.com/wiki/Anne_Boonchuy Anne Boonchuy] at the [https://hero.fandom.com/wiki/Heroes_Wiki Heroes Wiki]\n\n{{Amphibia}}\n[[pl:Anna Zaradna]]\n[[pt-br:Anne Boonchuy]]\n[[ru:\u042d\u043d\u043d\u0438 \u0411\u0443\u043d\u0447\u0443\u0430\u0439]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Amphibia characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Birds]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Dancers]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Chefs]]\n[[Category:Martial Artists]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Disney All-Star Racers characters]]\n[[Category:Asian characters]]"
