He is a red woodpecker with big yellow eyes and dressed up in a brown hat, a blue bandana, brown boots and a gold star badge. Peck owns a mule named Clementine, whose slow, easygoing nature sometimes contrasts with Peck's character. Peck likes to eat corn and prairie peppers, but his favorite food is Trail Mix, as shown in \"[[Peck's Trail Mix Mix-Up]]\".\n\n==Personality==\nPeck is loyal, honest, hardworking, and kind but in \"Horseshoe Peck\", he is a bad sport. He brags and boasts that he is the best at horseshoe tossing until Callie teaches him a lesson about being a good sport. Also, in \"Jail Crazy\", when Callie made Peck the substitute sheriff so she can fill in for the mail, he became obsessed with the rules in his rulebook, that he sent everyone to jail for \"rule-breaking\". His bossiness got the best of him, though, when Billy Goat the Kid who broke out of another jail cell began looting the stores and cornered the cowardly Peck, until Callie came to rescue, and taught Peck a lesson to be nice and friendly regardless of the rules. In \"Peck's Trail Mix Mix Up\", he put a hole in his trail mix bag and thought everyone was eating it. He is a bit of a perfectionist and a little impatient. And whenever something goes wrong, he gets annoyed very quickly. Also, in \"Parotting Pedro\", Peck put Pedro in jail for imitating him and eventually ran away. When Callie took Pedro to Echo Canyon, Pedro realized that imitating Peck made him feel silly and apologized.\n\nDeputy Peck is generally loyal, honest, hardworking, and kind. However, he is also a bit of a perfectionist and can be very impatient with others. \nIn some instances he shows some other negative traits, such as ''Horseshoe Peck'', in which he discovers the sport of horseshoes, he develops into a braggart and bad sport, and Callie has to teach him some humility.\n\nIn ''Jail Crazy'', Peck is made the substitute sheriff to fill in for Callie. He soon became obsessed with the word of the rulebook and began to send everyone to jail for \"rule-breaking\". But when Billy Goat the Kid broke out and cornered Peck, it taught him a lesson in being nice and friendly regardless of the rules. In \"Parotting Pedro\", Peck put Pedro in jail for imitating him.\u00a0\nIn ''\"''Peck's Trail Mix Mix Up''\"'', Peck accidentally pokes a hole in his trail mix bag and begins to accuse others of taking it.\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\">\nSC CTW0.png|Peck in ''The Cat Who Tamed the West''.\nSC CTW4.png|Peck and Toby in ''The Cat Who Tamed the West''.\nSC TMM2.png|Peck in the book of ''Peck's Trail Mix Mix-Up''.\nSC TMM3.png|Peck and Toby in ''Peck's Trail Mix Mix-Up''.\nCallieTobyPeck Intro.png\nPeck_SC1_1.png.png|Peck playing horseshoes.\nPeck_SC2_2.png\nTobyPeck SC2 1.png\nTobyPeck SC46 1.png\nPeck_SC48_1.png\nPeck_SC48_2.png\nCalliePeck SC52 2.png\nPeck_SC52_2.png\nPeck_SC53_1.png\nPeck_SC55_1.png\nCalliePeck SC56 1.png\nTobyPeckKit SC56 1.png\nPeckKit_SC56_1.png\nPeck_SC57_1.png\nTobyPeck SC57 1.png\nPeck_SC57_3.png\nPeck2.png\nDeputypeck.png\nRustle Up That Rhyme.png|Peck with Mr. Dillo.\nPeck and Barker.png|Peck with Sheriff Barker\nNobody Flies Like Me.png\nDeputy Peck pecking.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Sheriff Callie's Wild West}}\n[[Category:Sheriff Callie's Wild West characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Woodpeckers]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Cowboys & cowgirls]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Songwriters]]\n[[Category:Singer-songwriters]]"
