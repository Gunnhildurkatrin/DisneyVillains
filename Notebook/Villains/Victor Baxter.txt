He starts out as a chef in a restaurant, but he later opens his own restaurant, The Chill Grill. His biggest rival is Leonard Stevenson. In ''Cory in the House'', he gets a job as the President's chef, and it is unknown what became of his restaurant. His catchphrases are \"Here comes the pain!\" and \"I'll go pack!\" (''Cory in the House'').\n\nHe makes a guest appearance in the ''[[Raven's Home]] ''episode \"Just Call Me Vic\". He is also referenced by Raven, when she talks of how she drove her parents crazy. He is mentioned once again in \"[[Vest in Show]]\", where Chelsea reminisces with Raven, about working with Victor in the [[Chill Grill]]. He will return in Season Five of the show as a main character, in which Raven and Booker will care for him as he has a \u201cmild heart attack\u201d.<ref>https://deadline.com/2021/10/ravens-home-renewed-season-5-disney-channel-rondell-sheridan-reprise-original-role-casting-changes-1234847720/</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n\n* There's a possibility that he may not be fond of Tanya's mom just like how Tanya used to dislike his mother.\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nThats So Raven - Cast- Promotional Image.jpg\nThat's So Raven - Victor, Eddie, Raven, Cory and Chelsea.jpg\nThat's So Raven - Baxter Family 2.jpg\nThat's So Raven - Victor, Eddie, Raven, Cory and Chelsea 3.jpg\nThat's So Raven - Baxter Family.jpg\nThat's So Raven - Victor, Eddie, Raven, Cory and Chelsea 2.jpg\nThat's So Raven - Baxter Family 3.png\nCory in the House - Cast.jpg\nCory in the House - 1x16 - That's So in the House - Photography - Cory, Victor and Raven.jpg\nThat's So Raven - 4x13 - Mad Hot Cotillion - Photography - Raven and Victor.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Baxter, Victor}}\n\n{{That's So Raven}}\n{{Cory in the House}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Cory in the House characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:That's So Raven characters]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Grandparents]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Raven's Home characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
