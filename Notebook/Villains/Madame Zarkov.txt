She was an apparent advisor on the mystic in some regard for the [[Society of Explorers and Adventurers]], namely to club-president [[Jason Chandler]]. Around 1880, Jason contacted Zarkov to assist fellow S.E.A.-member [[Barnabas T. Bullion]], who was encountering paranormal disasters in his [[Big Thunder Mining Company|mining-operation]] at [[Big Thunder Mountain]]. Due to the mountain being inhabited by a [[Spirit of Big Thunder|vengeful spirit]], Zarkov advised Chandler to urge Bullion to abandon his mining.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Madame Zarkov would become a member of the Adventurers Club, a splinter-faction of the S.E.A., which was created by business-tycoon [[Merriweather Adam Pleasure]]. In [[1937]], Zarkov would attend a [[December 31|New Year's Eve party]] on Pleasure Island at the Adventurers Club headquarters on Pleasure Island in [[Lake Buena Vista]], [[Florida]].\n\n===Development History===\nMadame Zarkov was a live-performed character created for the Adventurers Club of [[Walt Disney World Resort|Walt Disney World]]. She would later be incorporated into Big Thunder Mountain Railroad at the [[Magic Kingdom]] with additional allusions to the Museum of the Weird and S.E.A. The Museum of the Weird is an unbuilt attraction planned to be an extension of the [[The Haunted Mansion (attraction)|Haunted Mansion]] in [[Disneyland]]'s [[New Orleans Square]], which was developed by imagineer [[Rolly Crump]]. Zarkov's connection to the Mansion might be inspired by, \"'''Madame Z'''\", a character created by [[Marc Davis]] for the Haunted Mansion, who later evolved into [[Madame Leota]].\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===The Adventurers Club===\nZarkov was an irregular character at the club who typically served as a replacement for regular-character Samantha Sterling. During the club's later performances, they would both often appear in the attraction more regularly.\n\n===Big Thunder Mountain Railroad===\nIn the queue for this attraction, Madame Zarkov is mentioned by Jason Chandler in a letter sent to Barnabas T. Bullion referring to the supernatural occurrences of Big Thunder Mountain.\n{{Big Thunder Mountain Railroad}}\n{{Society of Explorers and Adventurers}}\n{{The Haunted Mansion}}\n[[Category:Pleasure Island]]\n[[Category:Romani characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Big Thunder Mountain Railroad Characters]]\n[[Category:S.E.A. characters]]\n[[Category:The Haunted Mansion characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]"
