She is an insecure and tomboyish girl who works at the local bait shop her dad owns. \n\n== Film Appearance ==\nPrincess Rosalinda  is about to be crowned queen of the small kingdom of [[Costa Luna]]. General Kane, the dictator of neighbouring country Costa Estrella, infiltrates her palace with his agents during her coronation rehearsal, and attempts to capture the royal family and take over the country. Carter's father, Major Mason, whisks her away to safety via helicopter.\n\nThe Princess Protection Program hides Rosalinda in The Masons\u2019s home in [[Louisiana]], where she has to pretend to be Carter's cousin from Iowa named Rosie Gonzalez. Though Carter initially treats Rosie with annoyance and barely-masked hostility, she warms up to her after Rosie explains her situation, and the two become close friends. Carter teaches Rosalinda to act like a normal girl and Rosie shows Carter how to disarm those that scorn them by behaving as a princess. The two are nominated for the homecoming queen, which makes Carter's rival, Chelsea, jealous.\n\nIn an attempt to trick Rosie into exposing her location, General Kane announces plans to forcibly marry Rosie's mother, Queen Sophia. Rosie is distraught and tells Carter that she has decided to secretly return home. Knowing Costa Luna is still too dangerous, Carter secretly devises a plan to pose as Rosie and then use herself as bait to lure Kane into capture. Mr. Elegante, Rosie's royal dress designer, tells Kane that Rosie will be attending the homecoming dance and will be wearing a blue dress that he actually sends to Carter. In the meantime, Rosie agrees to help Carter behave like a princess by helping a group of girls dress up for the dance; The girls all wear masks, which helps Carter disguise herself as Rosie.\n\nAccording to plan, Kane and his agents mistake Carter for Rosie and lead her to Kane's helicopter the night of the dance. However, Rosie narrowly discovers and ruins the plan by exposing herself to Kane, insisting that this is not Carter's fight. Fortunately, agents of the Princess Protection Program, including Mr. Mason, have been waiting inside the helicopter and rescue both girls. The PPP agents quickly apprehend Kane and his henchmen and turn them over to the international authorities.\n\nAt the end, Carter realizes what \"a jerk\" Donnie is and goes to the dance with Ed, her best friend who has had a crush on her for a long time. Rosie is crowned Queen of Costa Luna with Carter, Major Mason, Ed, Queen Sophia, and Mr. Elegante in attendance.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* She dreams of becoming her crush, Donnie's girlfriend ever since they kissed under the basketball hoop when they were in third grade.\n*In the extended ending, one year later, Carter and Rosalinda both became P.P.P. agents and are getting ready for their new assignment as they board a plane.\n* [[Selena Gomez]], who played Carter Mason, also played a [[Alex Russo|character]] in [[Wizards of Waverly Place|''Wizards of Waverly Place'']] whose [[Mason Greyback|boyfriend]] is also named Mason (though it is his first name, not last name).\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nCarter Mason.jpg\nCarter Mason fashionista.jpg\nRosie &amp; Carter friends.jpg\nRosie &amp; Carter.jpg\nCarter Mas.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mason, Carter}}\n[[Category:Princess Protection Program characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:People]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel Original Movie Characters]]"
