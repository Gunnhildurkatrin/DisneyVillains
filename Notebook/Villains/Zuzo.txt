Taking it is the tough part!|Zuzo to Elena}}\n'''Zuzo''' is a character who appears in the [[Disney Channel]] animated series, ''[[Elena of Avalor]]''. He is a wily spirit fox who guides [[Princess Elena|Elena]] through the human and spirit worlds.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Sofia the First]]''===\nZuzo appears in the special ''[[Elena and the Secret of Avalor]]''. When [[Shuriki]] seized control of the Kingdom of [[Avalor]] following the murder of [[King Raul and Queen Lucia|the king and queen]] and imprisonment of the surviving members of the royal family, [[Alacazar]], the royal sorcerer, entrusted his chanul Zuzo to send the princess who has the [[Amulet of Avalor]] on a journey to free Elena from the amulet so she could free Avalor.\n\nForty-one years later, [[Sofia the First (character)|Princess Sofia]] obtains the amulet and travels to Avalor to speak with Zuzo. At Alacazar's old home, Sofia meets Alacazar's grandson Mateo, who helps summon Zuzo from the spirit world. After he is summoned, Zuzo quickly greets them and explains that the only way to free Elena is to place the amulet in the statue of Azaluna with Shuriki's wand. After he finishes his instructions, Zuzo gives Sofia special advice and he then returns to the spirit world. Sofia understands the meaning behind his words later on, when she gets everyone in Avalor to join together and overthrow Shuriki.\n\n===''[[Elena of Avalor]]''===\nZuzo appears in the show that follows the events of the special. Due to residue magic left over from the Amulet of Avalor after she was freed, Elena is able to see and communicate with Zuzo without having to summon him at all. In turn, Zuzo is able to offer Elena advice in times of need. Due to his service under Alacazar, Zuzo knows much about the magic of Avalor and so is able to explain Elena's discoveries of her enhanced magic to her.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Zuzo is based on a chanul, and the belief of a Mayan tribe in southern Mexico that everyone has a spirit double in the animal world, such as the [[Wikipedia:Tzotzil people|Tzotzil]].<ref>[[:File:Elena-Infographic.jpg|Elena Infographic]]</ref>\n*In \"[[Spirit Monkey Business]]\", it's revealed that Zuzo also acts as the spirit guide for other people and not just Elena.\n*Zuzo had a different appearance in ''[[Elena and the Secret of Avalor]]'' because the special was handled by the crew behind ''Sofia the First'' instead of ''Elena of Avalor''.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Gerber, Craig|date=November 22, 2016|website=Twitter|format=Tweet|url=https://twitter.com/_CraigGerber/status/800956080557690880|title=The Sofia crew made the special.
