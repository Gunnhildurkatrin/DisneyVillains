General Stilton was in charge of investigating the mysterious alien spacecraft that landed on Earth that brought [[Zunar-J-5/9 Doric-4-7]]. When the ship is discovered, it is confiscated by the Army and brought to a secret base called \"Hopscotch\". One soldier wonders if the ship came from Russia, but this is dismissed by General Stilton, who says \"don't see no hammer & sickle on the side\". He (correctly) believes the craft is extraterrestrial but warns they need to get to the bottom if it as (incorrectly) believing by now \"some slimy 12-legged creature could be crawling under the White House\".\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{The Cat from Outer Space}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stilton, General}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:The Cat from Outer Space characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Generals]]\n[[Category:Military characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]"
