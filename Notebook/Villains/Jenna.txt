She is one of the people on [[Max Keeble|Max]]'s newspaper delivery route, one of his schoolmates, and his initial crush.\n\n==Personality==\nInitially, Jenna is kind and seductive to Max. However, she has selfish and shallow toward [[Megan]].\n\nLater in the film, Jenna tells her best friend, [[Chelsea (Max Keeble's Big Move)|Chelsea]], she only viewed Max as her paperboy and never really liked him.\n\n==Role in the film==\nJenna first appears during Max's dream sequence at the beginning of the film waiting on the swing. He manages to deliver her paper after evading the [[Evil Ice Cream Man]]. She is just about to kiss him when the Evil Ice Cream Man arrives and ends up blasting her face with one of his ice cream pellets when the dream ends.\n\nJenna's first on-screen appearance is shortly after Max's life science class is dismissed for the day. He is knocked down by being hit by the door while mesmerized with her beauty, and she then asks if he is okay. She does not initially remember who he is until he tells her that she is on his newspaper delivery route. After some exchanges, they part ways, with him claiming that he plays the bassoon in response to learning that she plays the clarinet (specifically the first chair), though he leaves out that he does not actually bring the bassoon specifically because he wants to be cool. When band class comes around, Jenna and Megan met, to which the meeting is sour due to Jenna telling Megan to get off of her chair.\n\nLater on, Jenna invites Max to a milkshake party at Buddy's, when he is trying to get to his friend's house for a going-away party in his honor (he is moving to [[Chicago]]). He says no at first, saying he has to go there, but she starts flirting with him, eventually bending down to him and saying, \"one milkshake\". He ultimately accepts that. While walking, she puts her arm around him. At the party, however, it ultimately turns out to be more than one milkshake, and he tells her and her friends that Chad (the animal that pounced on [[Principal Elliot T. Jindrake]] after he tried to halt a food fight and humiliated him in front of the superintendent) is actually a chimpanzee and not a monkey and mentions that he has \"phatitude.\" Later on, as it becomes a night out at the party Jenna and Max start dancing together on top of one of the tables to the music, and they continue to have a great time until Max notices his best friends, Megan and [[Robe]], who've been waiting on him for their party see that he's carelessly ditched them for the cool kids. As Max notices Megan starting to sadly walk away (out of jealousy and sadness that Max likes Jenna, regardless of how selfish and rude she is to her) runs of the diner after her leaving Jenna by herself in disbelief as to why he left. Moments later, after Max is left alone, he looks back inside to notice Jenna dancing with Lil' Romeo as his replacement and walks home.\n\nThe next day, after Principal Jindrake makes his announcement to disband art, music, P.E., and pretty much everything fun as a result of Max's hijinx. After hearing him complains how her \"boyfriend\" got them into trouble, Jenna, clearly annoyed by this, denies ever liking him, claiming she has only ever viewed him as a paperboy (to protect popularity and reputation from being ruined) and nothing more.\n\nAfter the students manage to get rid of the bullies, Jenna happily approaches Max (seeing this as an opportunity to boost her popularity and reputation with the cool kids), offering him an invite to come to a party that her friends are having (rudely noting to Megan that it is only for ninth graders besides him), however, Max finally notices her shallow nature of his crush after seeing how to mean she is to Megan and respectfully turns down her offer stating he is meeting somebody (hinting at Megan, who notices this) and Megan tells her to go with the same gesture that she used against her earlier. Jenna carelessly walks off with her friend, saying, \"Whatever!\".\n\n==Trivia==\n* Her theme song is [[Britney Spears]]' \"...Baby One More Time\".\n* Brooke Anne Smith won a Young Artists Award for Supporting Young Actress for her role.\n*Jenna is a 9th grader and is three years old than Max.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\n10177977 622719924482308 2882270303015427676 n.jpg|Jenna in Max's dream at the start of the film\nMax Keeble s Big Move 024.png\n10168063 622718617815772 7698137686133721383 n.jpg|Jenna and Chelsea\n10174864 622718614482439 2060996817237700261 n.jpg\n10346312 640097062744594 915521350863633717 n.jpg\n10363643 640085902745710 2815376680636961794 n.jpg\n10325302 640085836079050 3967050681077516933 n.jpg\n10312407 640085906079043 3241562691374585773 n.jpg\n10367598 640085826079051 7411907404097121806 n.jpg\n10394668 640085822745718 1085907524606438771 n.jpg\nHello Sweetheart .jpg\nLaugh at Max .jpg\nJenna in Hallway .jpg\nYou Look .jpg\nHair.jpg\nJR High.jpg\nJR.jpg\nBeauty and Hot .jpg\nMaxKeebleburp.jpg\nIMG 6199.jpg\nIMG 6198.jpg\nIMG 6197.jpg\nIMG 6196.jpg\nIMG 6195.jpg\nIMG 6194.jpg\nIMG 6193.jpg\nIMG 6152.jpg\nIMG 6167.jpg\nIMG 6169.jpg\nIMG 6170.PNG\nIMG 6173.jpg\nIMG 6178.jpg\nIMG 6179.jpg\nIMG 6180.jpg\nIMG 6181.jpg\nIMG 6182.jpg\nIMG 6184.jpg\nIMG 6185.jpg\nIMG 6186.jpg\nJmx3.PNG\nJenna (pre-blasted).PNG\nJenna (blasted).PNG\nIMG 6187.jpg\nIMG 6189.jpg\nIMG 6346.PNG\nIMG 6642.jpg\nIMG 6643.jpg\nIMG 6644.PNG\nIMG 6645.PNG\nIMG 6646.PNG\nIMG 6647.PNG\nIMG 6648.jpg\nIMG 6649.jpg\nIMG 6650.jpg\nIMG 6651.jpg\nIMG 6652.PNG\nIMG 6653.PNG\nIMG 6654.PNG\nAli-maxkeeble_115.jpg\nJenna and Max's dancing.jpeg\nJenna flirting with Max .png\n</gallery>\n\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Max Keeble's Big Move characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Students]]"
