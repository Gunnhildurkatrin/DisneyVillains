She is voiced by\u00a0[[Debi Derryberry]].<ref>http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/Fillmore/Braces-Girl/</ref>\n\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nVery little is known about her personality. But if there's at least three traits that can easily describe her, it's that she seems to be quite precautionary, prudent, and concerned, especially when it comes to her braces.\n\n===Physical Appearance===\nShe is a caucasian teen girl, with reddish-orange hair with a fringe, worn in a ponytail, and a yellow hair band around it, has brown eyes and wears dental braces. She wears a long-sleeved purple shirt and as a member of the Safety Patrol, she too wears an orange sash over it, goldenrod pants and cyan, and white sneakers.\n\n==Red Robins Don't Fly==\nNot much is known about her, but it seems that she is another investigator of the Safety Patrol. This is confirmed in \"Red Robins Don't Fly\", when it was mentioned that somebody would have to go undercover as part of that episode's titular girl scout troop and one requirement was trying out the candy, particularly one of the stickiest. She had a brief role when she declined, stating \"I'm out. I can't go near taffy\", needless to say. It seems she also doubles as a crime scene photographer, as seen in one episode.\u00a0\n\n==Notes==\nHer dental braces cause her to speak with a slight lisp.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{Fillmore!}}\n[[Category:Fillmore characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Detectives]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]"
