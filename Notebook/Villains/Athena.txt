Athena is the one who swats the thunderbolt thrown by Hercules.

Eighteen years later, when Hades frees the Titans to attack Mount Olympus, Athena joins the battle against the Titans, she is seen imprisoned with the other gods after they lost against [[Hades]] and the [[Titans]]. Luckily she and the other gods are freed by Hercules.\n\n===''[[Hercules (TV series)|Hercules: The Series]]''===\nIn \"[[Hercules and the Secret Weapon]]\", when Athena is informed that Hephaestus made a secret weapon for Ares, Athena instructs Hercules to steal the secret weapon from Ares.

And when she sees Hercules fighting Clion, she offers him any weapon to fight with. He chooses a junior javelin, much to her confusion. After Hercules has won she cheers, \"Athens is number one!\"\n\nIn \"[[Hercules and the River Styx]]\" and \"Hercules and the Pool Party\", Athena is one of the deities who ends up having her memory wiped clean after bathing in the Pool of Lethe at Hades' Pool Party.\n\nIn \"[[Hercules and the Owl of Athens]]\", Athena shaves Ares' dogs of war as a childish prank and he seeks revenge by threatening to do the same to her owl, [[Ibid]]. When she bestows it to Hercules for safekeeping, Ares sends his sons to reclaim it. When she and Hercules team up to get Ibid back, Fear and Terror capture her and Ares, needing Hercules to save them.\n\n==Trivia==\n*It appears that she has a pet owl named Ibid.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n{{Hercules}}\n{{Kingdom Hearts}}\n[[fr:Ath\u00e9na]]\n[[Category:Hercules characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Immortal]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Greek Mythology]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Olympian Gods]]\n[[Category:Greek characters]]\n[[Category:Goddesses]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Twins and Triplets]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Warriors]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]"
