Since Mulan came back from the [[Imperial City]], she was inspired by Mulan. Her name is a faux-Chinese version of the name \"Sharon.\"\n\n==Personality==\nShe appears to be brave like [[Fa Mulan|Mulan]] but\u00a0has a fear of crickets, as seen in the film when Mulan sings the line: \"It's okay to be afraid.\" However, she quickly overcomes her fear and pets [[Cri-Kee]].\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Mulan II]]''===\nShe appears just after [[Fa Zhou]] leaves to \"pray\" on the field with her friends and begs Mulan to teach them kung fu. When [[Li Shang|Shang]] turns up, he asks Mulan if there's somewhere private where he and Mulan could talk. Sha-Ron giggles and says \"We could go to my house.\" Mulan dismisses the girls, but Sha-Ron just looks at Shang with her large black eyes. Shang gives her his helmet, which she happily takes and runs off with. She is seen later in the crowd that [[Grandmother Fa]] invites when she finds out about Mulan's engagement.\n\n{{Mulan}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Mulan characters]]\n[[Category:Chinese characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
