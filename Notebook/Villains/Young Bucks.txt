They are seen doing their annual run out in the meadow. Two of the bucks are seen using their antlers in a fight for one of the does out on the meadow ([[Aunt Ena|Faline's mother]] and [[Bambi's mother]] both already have mates). The bucks stop when [[the Great Prince of the Forest]] walks out on the meadow. The last time you see them is when [[Man]] is trying to hunt them after their run when they're eating.\n\n===''[[Bambi II]]''===\nThe bucks are only seen using their antlers to fight and then when doing their annual run, joined by [[Bambi (character)|Bambi]], [[Ronno]] and the Great Prince.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the first film, the bucks had two-pointed antlers, whilst in the second film, they had three-pointed ones. This was presumably because of their appearance in the second film takes place a few months after their appearance in the first film.\n*In some\u00a0Tanya Cookies Videos, the Young Bucks are the only characters in media, animation, and video to be featured in Tanya Cookies. They make a brief cameo apperance in Tokelauan Island Earthquake. They had been\u00a0voted as their second place to vote in the Young Bucks episode.\n*There is also a tag team in Ring of Honor & New Japan Pro Wrestling called \"The Young Bucks\", which consists of Matt Jackson & Nick Jackson.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nImageybib.jpg|The young bucks in ''Bambi''\nImagebambiybr.jpg|The Young Bucks fleeing to escape Man\nbambi2-disneyscreencaps.com-5092.png|The Young Bucks first appearance in ''Bambi II''\nbambi2-disneyscreencaps.com-5188.png|The Young Bucks second and last appearance in ''Bambi II''\n29yo1v6.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Bambi}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Deer]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Bambi characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]"
