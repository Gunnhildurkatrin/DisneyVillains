He is voiced by [[Billy Bletcher]]\n\n\n==Functions==\nHis job is to greet the customers who enter the museum and take off the hat of the guests.\n\n==Problems==\nThe Robot Butler seems compelled to take someone's hat whether they want him to or not. He'll also follow the visitors of the museum around and takes their hats if he finds them on him or her.\n==Hats taken from Donald==\n\n*Donald's classic white sailor's hat.\n*A top hat.\n*A [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleonic]] officer hat.\n*A baby bonnet.\n*A derby.\n\n==Mannerisms==\nThe Robot Butler appears to be very polite as he answered [[Donald Duck|Donald's]] question of who he was. He also continually refers to Donald as \"sir\". However, he becomes greatly annoyed when Donald refuses to give up his hat, shoving Donald down to take it. The Robot then thanks Donald. Also, when Donald put on a civil war kerpi, the only hat the robot didn't take, the Robot Butler's eye turns red, and he chases after Donald.\n\n<gallery>\nDonald_Duck_Modern_Inventions_020.jpg|The Robot Butler takes his first hat\nDonald_Duck_Modern_Inventions_040.jpg|The Robot Butler takes his second hat\nDonald_Duck_Modern_Inventions_069.jpg|The Robot Butler chases after Donald.\nModern_inventions_11large.jpg|The Robot Butler takes Donald's baby bonnet\nDonald's inventions.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Attractions in Museum of Modern Marvels]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]"
