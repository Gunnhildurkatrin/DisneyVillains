He is a skeleton who rows [[Hades]]' boat to his Lair. Charon is a ferryman for dead souls, and sends the souls across the River Stygian for the price of a drachma. Charon is very greedy, and corpses are buried with a coin in their mouth to pay the fee.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Hercules (film)|Hercules]]''===\nHe was seen rowing the boat for [[Hades]] in the [[Underworld]].\n\n===[[Hercules (TV series)|''Hercules'' (TV series)]]===\nIn \"[[Hercules and the Underworld Takeover]]\", when [[Hercules (character)|Hercules]], [[Pain and Panic]] bring a herd of sheep to the Underworld on their mission to liberate the Underworld from [[Hecate]], Charon warns them that Hecate will be upset. Panic smugly reminds him that he would have to answer to Hades when he returns from the meeting on [[Mount Olympus]]. Growing nervous, Charon asserts that he just rows the boat.\n\nIn \"[[Hercules and the World's First Doctor]]\", on their way to retrieve Hippocrates' soul, Charon refuses Hercules and [[Philoctetes|Phil]] passage because they're not dead. However, Phil is able to bribe him with a copy of the Greekly World News, prompting the ferryman to excitedly invite the pair onto his boat. As Hercules rows them along the River Styx, Charon enjoys the article bashing the Trojans. He then shows them the backward into the Underworld, so that he wouldn't get in trouble with Hades. As they part ways, Phil hands him the news scroll, which Charon continues to read.\n\nIn \"[[Hercules and the Disappearing Heroes]]\", Charon ferries Philoctetes, [[Chipacles]], Hercules, and all the other heroes Hecate depowered to the Underworld to stop her. Noting how much Hercules goes down there for a not-dead guy, he offers him a multiple fare discount ticket and membership in their frequent \"dier\" program, but he declines.\n\n===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===\n[[File:Once Upon a Time - 5x11 - Swan Song - Charon.jpg|thumb|left|250px]]\nCharon is first seen in the episode \"[[The Price (Once Upon a Time)|The Price]]\". After the [[Furies|Fury]] arrives to collect [[Robin Hood (character)|Robin Hood]]'s soul to take him to the underworld, she accesses a portal in the river in which Charon appears. After [[The Evil Queen|Regina]] and her allies help defeat the Fury, Charon disappears.\n\nWhen [[Captain Hook|Hook]] succumbs to the darkness, he uses [[Rumplestiltskin|Gold]]'s blood to create a portal to the [[Underworld]]. Charon arrives, with his boat full of the previous Dark Ones who have arrived to [[Storybrooke]] from the Underworld.\n\nAfter [[Emma Swan|Emma]] realizes that Hook's sacrifice was made meaningless by Gold, she asks him to open a portal to the Underworld to take them there. Gold summons Charon and Emma and her allies go to his boat and sail to the Underworld to find Hook.\n\n===''[[Legend of the Three Caballeros]]''===\nCharon appears in the episode \"[[Mt. Fuji Whiz]]\" after being summoned by [[Xandra]]. He tells her that being a grim and sinister ferryman was just scaring away customers so he overhauled his small spooky boat into a big cruise ship and took on a much more jovial and energetic persona.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Despite making repeated appearances in the ''Hercules'' film and animated show, Charon is never referred to by name.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nHercules-hercules-1853544-720-536.jpg\nhercules-br-disneyscreencaps.com-715.jpg\nHercules-br-disneyscreencaps.com-724.jpg\nHercules-disneyscreencaps.com-605.jpg\nHercules-br-disneyscreencaps.com-773.jpg\nCerber.jpg\nOnce Upon a Time - 5x11 - Swan Song - Charon.jpg|Charon in ''Once Upon a Time''\nUnderworld Journey Swan Sings.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Hercules}}\n{{Once Upon a Time}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Hercules characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Greek characters]]\n[[Category:Greek Mythology]]\n[[Category:Skeletons]]\n[[Category:Once Upon a Time characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Wonderful World of Color]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:The Three Caballeros characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]"
