"'''Doctor Renard''' is a major character in the comic book of ''[[Space Mountain]]''.\n\n==Role in the book==\nRenard's early life is unknown. He joins the team that travels to Tomorrowland, but after [[Anne Krell]] plants a time bomb on their ship, Renard winds up in a timeline in the Golden Age of piracy. He is nearly forced to walk the plank after he attempts to reason with his captors in regard to their diets, insisting they will become scurvy, but they take this the wrong way (He was referring to an illness and they thought he was using their own insults on them.) He leaves with the others and they return to the original timeline, where they are able to defeat Krell.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n[[Category:Space Mountain characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Time travelers]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
