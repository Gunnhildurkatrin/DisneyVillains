While on an expedition in Papua New Guinea, he came across a young monkey trapped in the web of a giant spider. After rescuing him, he adopted the monkey as his pet, naming him Albert after a beloved uncle. Ever since, the two have travelled together and discovered many artifacts and treasures around the world. Mystic would also build a new home and adventure base in the New Guinea jungle, which he would call [[Mystic Point]]. His house, known as Mystic Manor, would open its doors to the public as a museum in 1896.\n\nTo help manage his 7000 artifact collection, he has also enlisted the help of his grandnephew James among others. In 1909, Mystic and Albert acquired a mysterious enchanted music box while traveling in Bali said to bring inanimate objects to life when opened. Though he did not see what had occurred, Albert's opening of the music box nearly threw his collection in disarray, though the chaos that ensued was undone upon the box being closed.\n\n==Disney Parks==\n\n===Hong Kong Disneyland===\n\n====Mystic Manor====\nLord Henry Mystic is the owner of Mystic Manor, the setting and namesake of this attraction. The items within all belong to him and his voice can be heard during the pre-show. While appearing in a variety of portraits, his only physical appearance is at the beginning and end of the ride in the cataloguing room.\n\n====[[Explorer's Club Restaurant]]====\nNotes from Lord Mystic can be found around this restaurant explaining the origins of different relics he put on display in the setting.\n\n====[[Jungle River Cruise: Curse of the Emerald Trinity]]====\nA newsletter handed out for this [[Jungle Cruise]] overlay quoted Lord Henry Mystic on his loathing for former SEA-member [[Garrett Reed]], an antagonist in the attraction.\n\n===[[Disneyland]]===\n\n====[[Adventure Trading Company]]====\n\"The Daily Gnus\" newsletter for the Adventure Trading Company game at Disneyland mentioned Lord Henry Mystic as a noted recipient of the Elephant Juju, given for demonstrating one's tracking skills, for \"assembling the largest collection of lost goods of the last century\". Mystic's name also appeared first on a list of adventurers that ran the Trading Company.\n\n====[[Jungle Cruise]]====\nMystic is referenced in the queue for the Jungle Cruise in notes left on a map by Dr. Albert Falls. This map has a message from Falls saying to take advice from, \"'''Henry M.'''\" and to, \"Look but not touch\" while exploring the Temple of [[Mara (Indiana Jones)|Mara]].\n\n====[[The Tropical Hideaway]]====\nLord Henry is one of the S.E.A. members that has contributed to the [[The Tropical Hideaway|Tropical Hideaway]]'s display of expedition paddles and oars, with Henry's paddle coming from an 1874 expedition on the Ganges River in India.\n\n===[[Walt Disney World]]===\n\n====[[Skipper Canteen]]====\nOne of his S.E.A. membership fezes can be found in the [[Jungle Navigation Company|Jungle Navigation Co]]. Ltd. Skipper Canteen restaurant, as well as books written by him. Titles include \"A Manor of Fact\", \"Primates as Shipmates\", and \"Treasures of the Manor\".\n\n===[[Tokyo DisneySea]]===\n\n====[[Soaring: Fantastic Flight]]====\nA portrait of Lord Mystic attending the SEA indoctrination of [[Camellia Falco]] in 1851 can be found in the queue for this attraction.\n\n==Other Appearances==\n\n===Printed materials===\n\n====[[Tales from the Haunted Mansion]]====\nHenry Mystic is briefly mentioned in the third ''Tales from the Haunted Mansion'' book as a collecting rival of Colonel Tusk. Tusk justifies his exploitation of [[The Mummy|the mummy]] and his tomb by saying that if he didn't do it, a rival such as Lord Henry Mystic would.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Henry Mystic and Albert were originally to be depicted in a more realistic fashion, keeping with [[Tokyo DisneySea]]'s [[Tower of Terror (Tokyo DisneySea)| Tower of Terror]]. However, in an effort to make the attraction more appealing to families, the two characters were rendered in more of an animated style.\n*Despite being portrayed as a benevolent adventurer in contrast to vilified characters, such as Harrison Hightower III, Barnabas T. Bullion, and Prof. Garrett Reed, Mystic is often explicitly identified as having commit the same actions of colonialism, colonial theft, and grave-robbing as the two; often in the same manner. This includes having grave-robbed in Egypt, desecrated mummy remains, privately owning a museum of looted and pillaged cultural artifacts, and his having colonized Papua New Guinea to create Mystic Point.\n**This amorality is potentially referenced in ''Tales from the Haunted Mansion'' where Colonel Tusk references Lord Henry Mystic as a grave-robber who exploits the dead.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nMM_-_Henry_Mystic_and_Albert.jpg\nMM-Henry Albert Animatronics Ending.jpg\nMM - A Lasting Friendship is Born - Papua New Guinea.png|Lord Henry Mystic's Rescue of Albert.\nMM - Viking Ship.jpg|Henry and Albert discovering a Viking Ship.\nMM - The Mystic Magneto-Electric Carriage (Revealed at 1900 Paris Exposition).png|Presenting the Mystic Electro-Magneto Carriage at the 1900 Paris Exposition.\nAdventures with Lord Henry - Shadow Puppet Show.JPG|As a shadow puppet in \"The Adventures of Lord Henry\".\nSea main.jpg|A younger Henry Mystic attending the appointation of Camellia Falco into SEA\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*''[https://hauntedmansion.fandom.com/wiki/Lord_Henry_Mystic Lord Henry Mystic]'' on the ''[https://hauntedmansion.fandom.com/wiki/Haunted_Mansion_Wiki Haunted Mansion Wiki]''.\n{{The Haunted Mansion}}\n{{Society of Explorers and Adventurers}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mystic, Henry}}\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:English characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Haunted Mansion characters]]\n[[Category:S.E.A. characters]]\n[[Category:Lords]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Jungle Cruise characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Soarin' characters]]\n[[Category:Nephews]]\n[[Category:Uncles]]"
