He found [[Taran]] when he was a baby and took him in as his own.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[The Black Cauldron]]''===\nTaran later became restless to leave [[Caer Dallben]] to fight against the [[Horned King]] which Dallben disapproves of. Taran later leaves on his quest to protect Hen Wen. At the end of the movie, he is shown with Hen Wen and [[Doli]] saying that Taran did well, even though Gurgi has proven the hero by saving Prydain.\n===''[[House of Mouse]] ''===\nDallben made a slight cameo in ''House of Mouse''. In the episode ''[[Donald and the Aracuan Bird]]'', while Donald chases and searches for the Aracuan Bird (hint: right before the Aracuan Bird gets into Ursula's meal), Dallben is seen sitting at a table by Donald.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink|Dallben}}\n==Trivia==\n*Originally, Dallben was about to have a beard and was revealed as the true villain of the story in some early drafts for the film. However, this was eventually rejected, despite being more true to the source material.  \n*Dallben shares some facial features with Edgar Balthazar, the antagonist of ''[[The Aristocats]]''.\n\n{{The Black Cauldron}}\n\n[[fr:Dalben]]\n[[Category:Welsh characters]]\n[[Category:The Black Cauldron characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]\n[[Category:Chefs]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Mentors]]"
