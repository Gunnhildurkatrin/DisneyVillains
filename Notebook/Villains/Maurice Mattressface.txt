After Uncle Scrooge finds the stone in the labyrinth in King Minos' palace, he returns to the hotel where he turns everything into gold. Mr Matressface sees this and deduces they have already found the Philosopher's Stone and tries to reach Scrooge, only to be captured by [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]]. Mr Matterssface explains to the kids that they must take the stone away from Scrooge or he will turn himself into gold. They manage to stop Scrooge in a junkyard where he was turning everything into gold, and Mr Mattressface leaves with the Philosopher's Stone.\n\nMr Mattressface re-appears in two [[Don Rosa]] stories, [[The Crown of the Crusader Kings]] and [[The Old Castle's Other Secret or A Letter From Home]], both times alongside [[Mister Molay]]. Unlike Molay, Mr Mattressface is still loyal to his cause in each story, never seeking personal gain.\n\nIn ''A Letter From Home'', Scrooge trusts him the Templar treasure.\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Carl Barks]]\n[[Category:Articles needing improvement]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
