She would go on to haunt the [[Haunted Mansion (location)|Haunted Mansion]], though it is unknown if she had any affiliation with it in life or only moved in post-mortem via the [[Ghost Relations Department]].\n\n===Development History===\nAn old-lady ghost in a wheelchair was first proposed for the Haunted Mansion by imagineer [[Ken Anderson]] as shown in his concept art and an excerpt from a proposed scene where, \"''The room 'comes to life' as a green fire ignites itself in the fireplace and an empty rocking chair beside begins to rock''\". The element remained even after Anderson left the project with Grams being portrayed by the animatronic for the grandma from [[Carousel of Progress]].\n\nGrams is also frequently assumed to be '''Granny Ghoul''', a character voiced by [[Paul Frees]] (doing an impression of Ruth McDevitt) who appeared in promotional radio adds for the Haunted Mansion's opening in [[Disneyland]]. This character was revealed to have been a socialite from Peoria, [[Illinois]], who worked as a silent-film actress in vampire movies. As with Grams it is unknown when she first came to the Haunted Mansion, but it is known that she finds amusement in the extreme reactions mortals have to ghosts.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===The Haunted Mansion===\nGrams appears in the ballroom scene of the attraction, sitting in a rocking chair nearby a fireplace. As she rocks, she fades in and out of sight revealing the face-like design of her rocking-chair's back.\n\n==Other Appearances==\n\n===Video Games===\n\n====[[The Haunted Mansion (video game)]]====\nIn this video-game, Grams is one of the ghosts enslaved by [[Atticus Thorn]], who assists the protagonist [[Zeke Holloway]].
