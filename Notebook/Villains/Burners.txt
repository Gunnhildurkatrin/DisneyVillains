They are the protagonists of the series ''[[Motorcity]]''.\n\n==Description==\nThe Burners use their cars and other skills to prevent KaneCo technology from seizing Motorcity. Each member brings their unique skills and personality to the team, and are united under [[Mike Chilton]]'s leadership.\n\nEach active Burner has their own color scheme; Mike is green, [[Chuck (Motorcity)|Chuck]] is blue, [[Julie Kane|Julie]] is yellow, [[Dutch Gordy|Dutch]] is purple, and [[Texas (Motorcity)|Texas]] is red. All Burners but Chuck have an animal motif; Mike's a dog, Julie's a cat, Dutch's a scorpion, Texas' a rhinoceros, and [[Jacob (Motorcity)|Jacob]]'s a sasquatch.\n\n==Headquarters==\nJacob's restaurant, [[The Burner's HQ|Mutt Dogs]], serves as a headquarters for the gang, with a garage located below the diner.\n\n==History==\nThe group was founded by Mike Chilton after he discovered the cruel methods Kane employed to expand Detroit Deluxe into Motorcity.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nGroup-1-.jpg\njulie_by_95nika-d5ig81c.png|Cat\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*The term 'Burners' likely refers to the phrase burning up the road, which is slang for driving extremely fast.<ref>[http://thesaurus.com/browse/burned+up+road Definition of burning up the road]</ref>\n*The term 'Burners' may also refer to graffiti slang.<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Glossary_of_graffiti Glossary of graffiti terms]</ref>\n*The Burners' logo is EXTREMELY similar to the flaming 8 ball on the right arm of Megas from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megas_XLR ''Megas XLR'']. This is no coincidence, as many of the [http://motorcitydisneyxd.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Crew ''Motorcity'' crew] are the same writing and directing team for ''Megas XLR''.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Motorcity}}\n[[Category:Motorcity characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
