He wants to rule the whole world by making it dirty and wants to use Christopher Robin to help him do this because he believes that without him putting his belongings under the bed, Crud's kingdom would not have been possible. He has a sidekick named [[Smudge]] who is always sneezing and praising Crud with names like \"the master of mud\" and \"the surveyor of slime\". He also has crayon soldiers and used them to kidnap Christopher Robin's friends. He even uses some of Christopher's toys as his slaves. Despite being a ''[[Winnie the Pooh (franchise)|Winnie the Pooh]]'' character, Crud is dark and malevolent. He intends to make the world more dirty by spreading his dirt and grime everywhere with his reverse vacuum, and loses his temper if anyone talks about cleaning and washing, even claiming that he hates the words \"clean\" and \"washed up,\" as he hates being cleaned up. With his messy slimy exterior and his reverse vacuum cleaner, he plans to force Christopher Robin to help him make the world dirty.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]''===\nWhen Christopher Robin and his friends are set to clean his room, they try getting it done quickly by throwing things under the bed, but soon after, the stuff disappears. When they throw a shoe under the bed- thinking it wants more stuff, the shoe comes right back out like a bullet and an ominous voice responds with...\n\n\"No more shoes, please. We already have one.\".\n\n[[Winnie the Pooh|Pooh]] and [[Piglet]] nervously crawl under the bed to respond to the voice but end up getting sucked in to the under-the-bed world where Crud has established his kingdom of toys and junk and then captured and imprisoned by Christopher Robin's crayons, who have turned into Crud's guards. Later, [[Christopher Robin]] and Tigger enter the bed to find their friends and run into Crud's minion, Smudge, who leads them to Crud. The monster tells \"The boy\" that his kingdom was created because of Christopher Robin throwing things under the bed. When Christopher realises his mistakes and says he should clean up under the bed, Crud becomes enraged. He orders Smudge to reveal to the boy Crud's exact plan: forcing Christopher Robin's toys to pour slime into his \"un-vacuum,\" a reverse vacuum cleaner designed to spread dirt and grime all over the world. Crud wants Christopher Robin to help him with this, under a threat to presumably kill his friends, but he refuses, so Crud has him imprisoned. However, he and the others escape before Crud confronts them again. Christopher exposes Crud to a bar of soap, weakening him, and then the toys bring out a modified reverse vacuum. Together, they and Tigger suck Crud and Smudge into the vacuum, thus \"cleaning them up\" and erasing them from under the bed. To prevent the creation of another monster like Crud, Christopher Robin promises [[Christopher Robin's Mom|his mother]] to always clean his room afterwards.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Out of all the ''[[Winnie the Pooh (franchise)|Winnie the Pooh]]'' villains, Crud is the most evil, since he had bigger plans than anyone else.\n\n{{Winnie the Pooh}}\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Winnie the Pooh characters]]\n[[Category:Presumably Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]"
