When testing out his inventions, they all seem to fail even with the help of his pet \"good luck kitty cat\", [[Kismet]].\n\nAfter noticing Gadget with one of his inventions, he tries to stop her until he notices one of them fixed and working fine. Therefore, he considers her a lucky mouse and decides to keep her for more help and luck; much to Kismet's jealousy and anger, since she is actually the reason his inventions have been failing due to sabotage.\n\nA few moments later, after returning from the same park earlier with no four-leaf clover he found earlier for good luck, Cosgrove continues fixing the [[Meal-O-Matic]] for the Kitchen Appliance Convention and suffering threats of losing his job from his boss, [[Mr. Gribbish]].\n\nDespite the machine not being ready yet, it is taken to the convention and Cosgrove struggles to finish completing it, despite his boss' continuous threats.\n\nWhen Cosgrove sees Kismet trying to attack and eat Gadget, he finishes up his invention in a jiffy and sets it to seize Kismet. The machine shaves Kismet's fur off, thus, forcing her to flee and never to be seen or heard from again. It is at this point that Cosgrove realizes that all he needed was a better reason to be successful.\n\nWith the machine working perfectly, the impressed judges proclaim Cosgrove the winner and he is finally awarded the Golden Beater Award.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\">\nCosgrove-The Luck Stops Here01.png\nCosgrove-The Luck Stops Here02.png\nCosgrove-The Luck Stops Here03.png\nCosgrove-The Luck Stops Here04.png\nCosgrove-The Luck Stops Here05.png\nCosgrove-The Luck Stops Here06.png\nCosgrove-The Luck Stops Here07.png\nCosgrove-The Luck Stops Here08.png\nCosgrove-The Luck Stops Here09.png\nCosgrove-The Luck Stops Here10.png\nCosgrove-The Luck Stops Here11.png\nCosgrove-The Luck Stops Here12.png\nCosgrove-The Luck Stops Here13.png\nCosgrove-The Luck Stops Here14.png\nCosgrove-The Luck Stops Here15.png|A picture of Cosgrove when he last won an award.\nCosgrove-The Luck Stops Here16.png\nCosgrove-The Luck Stops Here17.png\nCosgrove-The Luck Stops Here18.png\nCosgrove-The Luck Stops Here19.png\nCosgrove-The Luck Stops Here20.png\nVlcsnap-2015-08-05-22h56m57s343.png\nCosgrove-The Luck Stops Here21.png\nCosgrove-The Luck Stops Here22.png\nCosgrove-The Luck Stops Here23.png\nCosgrove-The Luck Stops Here24.png\nCosgrove-The Luck Stops Here25.png\nCosgrove-The Luck Stops Here26.png\nCosgrove-The Luck Stops Here27.png\nCosgrove-The Luck Stops Here28.png\nCosgrove-The Luck Stops Here29.png\nCosgrove-The Luck Stops Here30.png\nCosgrove-The Luck Stops Here31.png\nCosgrove-The Luck Stops Here32.png\nVlcsnap-2015-08-05-22h59m55s664.png|Cosgrove steps on it.\nCosgrove-The Luck Stops Here33.png|\"I warned you, Kismet.
