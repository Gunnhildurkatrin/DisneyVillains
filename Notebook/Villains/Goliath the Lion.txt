His silliness and playfulness on the show can sometimes be seen in the beginning of each episode. He likes to hide from JoJo in the beginning of each episode.\nAlthough he generally speaks using only single words and often mimics what JoJo says, he nevertheless attends clown school together with her and her friends. Although JoJo refers to him as her \"pet lion,\" he seems sentient to some degree and the two of them are best friends and are almost always together.\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"185\">\nJojo's circus jojo and goliath.jpg\nJojo and her lion.jpg\nJojo and Goliath.jpg\n16180706892722775379080369182669.gif\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Jojo's Circus}}\n\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Playhouse Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Lions]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Jojo's Circus characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Circus performers]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
