He also has a Mousekadoer of his own called the \"Mousekadizz\" but it has different colors. [[Clarabelle Cow|Clarabelle]] operates the Mousekadizz instead of [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]].\n\nUnlike [[Toodles]], [[Quoodles]], [[Boodles]], and [[Goofles]], he doesn't seem to have a face or voice so throughout this whole episode, his faceplate is just a screensaver of swirly lines instead of circles, unlike Toodles, Quoodles, Boodles, and Goofles.\n\n== Trivia ==\n*Around some time when he was about to deliver a Mousekatool, Minnie accidentally tried to call Toodles instead of Woodles.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\n29-0.jpg|Woodles' Mousekadizz (aka Mousekadoer)\nScreen Shot 2017-12-20 at 1.57.52 PM.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Mickey Mouse Clubhouse}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Machines]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Magical Objects]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse Clubhouse characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Objects]]"
