Welcome to Zootopia.|Gazelle}}\n'''Gazelle''' is a famous popstar and mammal rights activist in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[2016]] animated feature film, ''[[Zootopia]]''.\n\n==Background==\nGazelle is very popular in the world of Zootopia, having many fans, which include [[Judy Hopps]], [[Clawhauser]], and surprisingly even the normally gruff and hard to impress [[Chief Bogo]]. Her importance and popularity stem from the fact that she is very socially-minded and is all about acceptance and equality for all.<ref name=\"20things\">[http://collider.com/zootopia-disney-facts-things-to-know/ ''\u2018Zootopia\u2019: 20 Things to Know about Disney's Latest Animated Adventure'' by Christina Radish], December 1st, 2015</ref>\n\n===Development===\n[[Shakira]]'s involvement with the film begun when the directors met her around [[2013]]. She fell in love with the idea and the central message.<ref name=\"20things\" />\n\n===Personality===\nGazelle is liked by almost all the citizens of Zootopia given her status as a famous pop star. Despite being a pop idol, Gazelle doesn't see herself as above anyone else, she is humble and kind.\n\nLike Judy, she cares for equality and loves Zootopia because she believes it is a place where animals are equals regardless of whether they are predators or prey, something that she's very passionate about. Her upbeat and accepting nature shows no limits to how far she thinks of others based on species. She even held a peace rally when the conflicts between predator and prey arose, her peaceful nature shows how level-headed she is in unfairness situations such as prejudice. All of her dancers are also shown to be predators, namely tigers, holding true to her values.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nGazelle, as her name obviously implies, is a gazelle with a slender figure, amber fur with a beige underside going up to her throat and muzzle. She has long, curving dark gray horns and light brown eyes. She has long, wavy locks of blonde hair that go over half her face.\n\nGiven her status as a pop idol, Gazelle wears a sparkling red skirt, crop top, and shoes with leggings that are below her knees. Her skirt also has a silver belt around it.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Zootopia]]''===\nGazelle is a pop singer/songwriter, choreographer, and was first introduced singing her song \"[[Try Everything]]\", on Judy Hopps' playlist as she is traveling to [[Zootopia (location)|Zootopia]], then at the end, where she was seen as a recording on a jumbo-tron TV introducing herself and saying \"Welcome to Zootopia\". She is later featured on a phone app where the user can tag their face on a tiger backup dancer performing next to Gazelle, which [[Clawhauser]] and [[Chief Bogo]] are fans of.\n\nLater on, as fear and discrimination against predators take hold in Zootopia for fear of them going savage, Gazelle holds a peaceful protest and publicly asks for the harmonious Zootopia she loves and cherishes to be restored, with many refusing to join.\n\nDuring the end credits, Gazelle, flanked by four dancing tigers, holds a concert in the middle of town square for all of Zootopia, including those incarcerated (though they all dance to it except for [[Bellwether]] and [[Mayor Lionheart|Lionheart]]).\n\n===Cameos===\nGazelle and her tiger dancers appear during the end credits of the ''Zootopia'' entry of the ''[[As Told by Emoji]]'' short series.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Gazelle is one of the few characters to actually wear shoes.\n**Ironically, her voice actress (famous pop singer, Shakira) doesn't normally like wearing shoes, at least for when she's performing.\n*Gazelle is one of the Zootopia characters to have their names play on their species. The others are [[Finnick]], [[Flash|Flash Slothmore]], [[Mayor Lionheart]], [[Yax]], [[Mr. Otterton]], and [[Mrs. Otterton]], [[Duke Weaselton]], [[Peter Moosebridge]], [[Doug (Zootopia)|Doug Ramses]], and [[Dr. Badger]].\n*Gazelle is currently the only ''Zootopia'' character to have the same actor in multiple versions of the movie, as Shakira voiced Gazelle in the English and two Spanish dubs of the movie.\n**However, there is no official Spanish version of her song \"[[Try Everything]]\", so even in said dubs, the song stays in English.\n*The \"Dancing With Gazelle\" app seen in the film is available on [https://www.dancingwithgazelle.com/ Disney websites.]\n*Gazelle is the only gazelle seen in the film.\n*Despite being female, Gazelle has the long horns of a male gazelle (female gazelles in real life have short horns).\n*[[Rich Moore]] confirmed that Gazelle is her real name, as opposed to a stage name.<ref>[https://twitter.com/_rich_moore/status/734475537586872320 Rich Moore via Twitter] May 22nd 2016</ref>\n*She is a model for Preyda and appears on the covers of magazines such as ''Vanity Fur''.\n*In 2020, Gazelle brought back attention as her actress Shakira wore a very similar outfit as her for the Halftime Show of the Super Bowl LIV.<ref>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7960153/Shakiras-red-Super-Bowl-outfit-looks-nearly-identical-outfit-Zootopia-character-wore.html</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n===Promotional===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nGazelle Zootopia.jpg\nZootopia Poster.jpg\nTry Everything Shakira.png\nTumblr o12ilob5eT1twa65po1 400.jpg\nGazelle w Tigers render.png\nDisneyMoviesAnywhere Zootopia.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Concept art===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nGazelle1.jpg\nGazelle2.jpg\nGazelle3.jpg\nGazelle4.jpg\nGazelle5.jpg\nGazelle6.jpg\nGazelle7.jpg\nGazelle8.jpg\nGazelle9.jpg\nGazelle10.jpg\nGazelle artwork by Byron Howard.jpg\nGazelle concept art .jpg\nGazelle sketches by Shiyoon Kim.jpg\nCory Loftis Shiyoon Kim Gazelle concept.jpg\nFawn Animation Art.png\nGazelle Art Transparent.png\nGazelle character head model.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nGazelle In Ipod.png|A picture of Gazelle on [[Judy Hopps|Judy]]'s iPod.\nTry Everything 10.png|\"Hi.
