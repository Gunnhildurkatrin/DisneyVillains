He also invites [[T.J. Detweiler|T.J.]] and the gang to the Fifth and Sixth Graders Club.\n==Appearance==\nKing Freddie is tall and slender. He has tan skin, slanted eyes, black hair, and wears a light green polo shirt, dark green pants, black sneakers, and after becoming king, a yellow crown-shaped baseball hat with a blue \"F\" on it.\n\n==Personality==\nBefore becoming King, Freddie was only a background character. At the beginning of ''[[Recess: School's Out]]'', King Bob crowns him king of the playground, as he's graduating that year.\nKing Freddie is shown to be bossy, and unlike King Bob, he was not a fair ruler. He often came up with cruel, harsh punishments for the kids, however his guards had to tell him to lay it a little easier.\n\nIn ''[[Recess: Taking the Fifth Grade]]'', he is only seen in \"Grade Five Club\".\n\n==Trivia==\n*King Freddie was once shown in King Bob's class in \"[[Pharaoh Bob]]\" and in the line in \"[[Omega Kids]]\", however, he is a year younger than him. This may or may not be considered a continuity error, as the episode was being made before ''Recess: School's Out'' was greenlit.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"185\">\nKing Freddy.png\nKing Freddie.jpg\nOro320reyfreddyII.jpg|Rey Freddy II\n</gallery>\n\n{{Recess}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Freddie}}\n[[Category:Recess characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Kings]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]"
