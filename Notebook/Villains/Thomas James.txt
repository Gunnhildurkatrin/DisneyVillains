Also, in another episode, Toejam and Brooke have a \"study date\" planned, and is shy to admit it's a date. When she changes her image and tries to cancel the date, Toejam attempts to change his image to fit in with Brooke's new image, proving that he likes her, but the plan backfires when Brooke goes back to her old self.\n\n==Romantic Life==\n===Brooke Nichols===\nToejam is not sure if he has a crush on\u00a0Brooke Nichols, but many hints lead to it.\n\n==Trivia==\n*He is the only character in\u00a0As The Bell Rings\u00a0who's last name is unknown, but yet, he is the second character to have a known middle name.\n*Toejam's nickname derived from his first and middle name, \"Thomas\" and \"James\".\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:James, Thomas}}\n[[Category:As The Bell Rings (U.S.) characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
