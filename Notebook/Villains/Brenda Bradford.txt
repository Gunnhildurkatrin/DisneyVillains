With this knowledge, she created [[Inspector Gadget (character)|Inspector Gadget]] as the first Cyborg Police Inspector for the Riverton Police Department. She serves as the deuteragonist of the film ''[[Inspector Gadget (1999 film)|Inspector Gadget]]'' along with [[Penny (Inspector Gadget)|Penny]].\n\n==Role in the film==\nBrenda Bradford's role in the film starts off when she is in the lab of her program (the gadget program) doing a test with her father, Dr. Artemus Bradford.\n\nThe test they were working on was a cybernetic foot, they discovered that it is only animated by will, not by thought, much to their happiness. After the test, she had a talk with the security guard, John Brown, outside, about how he always dreamed of saving people on in the future. But after their talk there was a break-in in the lab, Brenda came in, found Artemus dead, and was very heartbroken.\n\nJohn came into the lab and saw what happened and decided to bring justice to the murder, so a car chase began out in the city. John was able to catch the bad guys after a billboard fell on their car, but [[Dr. Claw|Sanford Scolex]] used dynamite to try to destroy him but he was only badly injured so Brenda decided to rebuild him as the very first cyborg police officer now named Inspector Gadget.\n\nWhen John finally woke up from his sleep he discovered himself with so many robotic gadgets inside of him he shows up to Brenda and she explains to him that this is his chance to help people. She then has been teaching him how to control his gadgets, then she builds him a talking crime-fighting car at name to A.M. [[Gadgetmobile]]. While John continues to try and show his affections to Brenda, she does not have strong feelings for him.  Brenda and John attended a party in honor of his heroic actions, and they danced together. But while they were dancing, Scolex came to interrupt, and Brenda was given the chance if she would like to work for his business and she agrees but while they were talking, John was listening. Brenda watches the news where a robotic version of Gadget was creating havoc in the city, but then the real inspector came to warn her that Scolex is a liar and he's the one who killed her father, begging her to go home and stay alive. Brenda soon met Robo Brenda, a robot who was created by Scolex, and realized she was copied by the foot and also realized Scolex killed Artemus, so she went out to go find John.\n\nBrenda found inspector at a dump, with Penny and Gadgetmobile, was sad because the chip was gone forever. But Brenda kisses John and he was brought back to life proving he didn't need the chip all he needs is the heart. So our heroes took off, to go fight Claw. Once and for all, Brenda was so angry. Furious about Scolex killing Artemus, she hit him really hard and she was being taken hostage. Brenda yells at Claw just until Inspector Gadget showed up in time to stop him. Brenda helped him up and they fell off but were safe and they finally kissed.\n\nFor unknown circumstances, Gadget ended his relationship with Brenda some point before ''[[Inspector Gadget 2]]''.\n\n{{Inspector Gadget}}\n[[Category:Inspector Gadget characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Articles needing improvement]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:Orphans]]\n[[Category:Tritagonists]]\n[[Category:Deuteragonists]]"
