'''Experiment 255''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]]. She is designed to make people sick with her nauseatingly sweet fumes. She appears in ''[[Stitch!]]''.\n\n==Background==\nExperiment 255 was the 255th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. She was designed to make\u00a0anyone sick with her nauseatingly sweet fumes. 255 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nMrs. Sickly is a light teal [[Mr. Stenchy]]-like experiment with golden eyes, puffier antennae and smaller hair.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nLike [[Mr. Stenchy]], Mrs. Sickly appears disarmingly cute to everyone else except other experiments, but then emits an extremely foul and noxious odor 48 hours after she is activated. Additionally, if Mrs. Sickly's emissions intermix with Mr. Stenchy's sour emissions, the chemical reaction will cause a cataclysmic explosion capable of destroying the planetary body they inhabit.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Stitch!]]''===\nMrs. Sickly first appeared when [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]] released her along with [[Mr. Stenchy]] during Christmas in [[Japan]]. As part of his plot, H\u00e4msterviel mass produced clones of Mr. Stenchy and Mrs. Sickly and sold them to many children across Japan and the rest of the world. This is when it\u00a0is revealed that if the emissions from these two mix, they have the power to destroy entire planets. This leads to [[Yuna Kamihara|Yuna]], [[Pleakley]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], H\u00e4msterviel, and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] on a hunt to round up the clones of Mr. Stenchy and Mrs. Sickly in order to save the world's Christmas.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Mrs. Sickly is one of the rare experiments to have sclerae and pupils instead of solid black eyes, the others being [[Mr. Stenchy]], [[Skip]], [[Clink]], [[Nosox]], and [[Bragg]].\n*While it is confirmed that Mrs. Sickly is Mr. Stenchy's wife, it remains unconfirmed whether her one true place is on [[Plorgonar]] with her husband.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nscreenCapture 02.04.13 16-07-23.jpg|\u8a66\u4f5c\u54c1255\u53f7\u30df\u30bb\u30b9\u30fb\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u30ea\u30fc translates to Prototype No. 255 Mrs. Sickly\nscreenCapture 02.04.13 16-11-34.jpg\nscreenCapture 02.04.13 16-16-48.jpg\nscreenCapture 02.04.13 16-18-47.jpg\nscreenCapture 02.04.13 16-19-18.jpg\nscreenCapture 02.04.13 16-23-07.jpg\nscreenCapture 02.04.13 16-24-23.jpg\nscreenCapture 02.04.13 16-24-43.jpg\nscreenCapture 02.04.13 16-25-04.jpg\nscreenCapture 02.04.13 16-25-31.jpg\nscreenCapture 02.04.13 16-25-51.jpg\nscreenCapture 02.04.13 16-26-14.jpg\nscreenCapture 02.04.13 16-27-26.jpg\nscreenCapture 02.04.13 16-27-54.jpg\nscreenCapture 16.04.13 10-31-50.jpg\nscreenCapture 16.04.13 10-33-03.jpg\nscreenCapture 16.04.13 10-33-50.jpg\nscreenCapture 16.04.13 10-34-57.jpg\nscreenCapture 16.04.13 10-36-08.jpg\nscreenCapture 16.04.13 10-39-22.jpg\nscreenCapture 16.04.13 10-40-16.jpg\nscreenCapture 16.04.13 10-44-28.jpg\nscreenCapture 16.04.13 10-45-53.jpg\nscreenCapture 16.04.13 10-46-26.jpg\nscreenCapture 16.04.13 10-47-16.jpg\nscreenCapture 16.04.13 10-48-36.jpg\nscreenCapture 16.04.13 10-55-05.jpg\nscreenCapture 16.04.13 10-55-55.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]"
