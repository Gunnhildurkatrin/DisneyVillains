'''Experiment 515''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]]. He\u00a0is designed to level entire forests.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment 515 was the 515th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Jacques von H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to cut down entire forests.\u00a0515 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.\n\nAt an unknown point, Experiment 515 was activated and went on a rampage.\n\nIn \"[[627 (episode)|627]]\", [[Stitch]] chased after 515 and managed to corner him in an alley, defeat him, and rehabilitate him. [[Gantu]] and [[Reuben|Experiment 625]] then arrived for 515, named Deforestator. While Reuben lagged behind, Gantu pointed a [[Net Cannon|net cannon]] at Deforestator, but the latter was able to simply use his powers to force the duo to retreat.\n\nIn \"[[Shoe (episode)|Shoe]]\", Deforestator was one of the experiments that helped turn [[Jumba's Ship|Jumba's ship]] into a [[Jumba & Pleakley's Bed & Not Breakfast|hotel]].\n\nDeforestator was one of the experiments in \"[[Checkers (episode)|Checkers]]\" that joined Stitch in a rebellion against Gantu.\n\nIn \"[[Ploot (episode)|Ploot]]\", Deforestator was one of the first team of experiments (along with [[Kixx]] and [[Richter]]) formed to try and stop [[Ploot]]. However, Ploot was easily able to defeat them, forcing the three experiments to retreat.\n\nIn \"[[Remmy (episode)|Remmy]]\", Deforestator was one of the experiments in [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]]'s dream.\n\nDeforestator was seen on a computer screen in \"[[Ace (episode)|Ace]]\", posing as an evil creation of [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]]'s as\u00a0part of a hoax to fool [[Mortlegax]], the head of E.G.O. industries.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nThe first 624 experiments, including Deforestator, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]] and [[Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nDeforestator participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]].\n\nThe Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]],\" which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe. Deforestator can be seen in the audience cheering.\n\n===''[[Stitch!]]''===\nDeforestator made an appearance in the ''Stitch!'' anime when [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]] disguised him as a punk and was about to use him for another plan, but called it off after developing a temporary \"soft side.\" Because of that, he didn't really do anything during the episode (except punished H\u00e4msterviel for failing [[Delia]] again).\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Deforestator was first revealed in a DVD bonus feature of ''[[Stitch! The Movie]]'' in the experiment gallery.\n*Deforestator is the first experiment to debut in [[627 (episode)|an episode]] not named after it, and to never\u00a0have an eponymous episode. He shares this trait with [[Zap]], who happened to debut in the same episode. Though [[Topper]] and [[Yaarp]] briefly appeared in \"[[Elastico (episode)|Elastico]]\", they still had their own [[Topper (episode)|respective]] [[Yaarp (episode)|episodes]].\n*Even though Deforestator was\u00a0activated off-screen, his [[Experiment Pods|pod]]\u00a0color is white according to \"[[Ace (episode)|Ace]]\".\n*Jumba refers to him as: \"Experiment 515: The Deforestator\"; however, his official name is mentioned in \"[[Ploot (episode)|Ploot]]\".\n*His number was also given to [[Splodyhead]] (in \"[[Slushy (episode)|Slushy]]\") and [[Ploot]], most likely due to Jumba's untidy [[Jumba's Computer|database]].\n*Deforestator's body appears in the online game ''[[Jumba's Lab (Game)|Jumba's Lab]]''.\n*Deforestator is one of few experiments to not have a known one true place.\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
