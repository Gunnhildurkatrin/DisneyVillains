'''Experiment 323''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]]. He is designed to cause societies to come to a crashing standstill by causing artificial lovesickness. Once he pecks someone, they fall in love with the first person they see regardless of their gender and personal preferences; only spraying water in the victim's face will break the spell. He was captured by [[Gantu]], but was rescued in \"[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]\".\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment 323 was the 323rd genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel's]] funding. He was designed to use his fake love-inducing ability to bring entire civilizations to a lovestruck standstill. 323 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.\n\nAt an unknown point, Experiment 323 was activated off-screen (possibly by an ocean wave). 323 then proceeded to cause artificial love across the island. He first targeted [[David Kawena|David]] and pecked the latter to make him fall for some other woman.\n\nLater, [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] attempted to capture 323 after noticing the experiment, but was thwarted by [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Stitch]]. 323 then pecked Gantu to make him fall in love with [[Pleakley]], while Stitch managed to capture 323 in a drink cooler. Lilo, after naming him Hunkahunka, used the experiment's love-inducing power to make [[Keoni Jameson|Keoni]] fall for Lilo.\n\nHowever, Hunkahunka was able to escape and resumed his fake love-inflicting rampage while being pursued by Lilo, Stitch and Gantu. At one point, Hunkahunka pecked Gantu again, causing the latter to temporarily fall for Stitch. While Stitch evaded Gantu, the former recaptured Hunkahunka and attempted to hide him in a raffle box, but he managed to escape again shortly after.\n\nLater, Hunkahunka entered a dance hall, where he caused countless victims to fall in love, and pecked [[Nani Pelekai|Nani]] to make her fall for Gantu. Eventually, after a long chase, Gantu was able to capture Hunkahunka in a containment orb. Regardless, Lilo ultimately decided that people should want others to love them for who they are, not merely because some alien bird pecked them.\n\nHunkahunka was successfully sent to an impatient [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]], where the former then pecked H\u00e4msterviel, causing him to fall for Gantu. However, he still insulted Gantu like he would on a regular basis, implying that Hunkahunka's love powers had a somewhat different effect on H\u00e4msterviel.\n\nHunkahunka reappeared in \"[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]\", and was freed along with Gantu's other captive experiments by Lilo, Stitch, and several other experiments in a rescue mission.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nThe first 624 experiments, including Hunkahunka, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium\u00a0to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]] and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nHunkahunka participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]],\u00a0as he was seen among the other experiments.\n\nThe Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.\n\n===''[[Stitch!]]''===\nHunkahunka made an appearance in the ''Stitch!'' anime where [[Stitch]] used him on [[Angel]] after she got mad at him earlier. However, Hunkahunka's spell caused Angel to become too obsessed with Stitch, therefore teaching him a lesson when Hunkahunka also made others fall in love (including [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], who was about to reveal the antidote before becoming part of Hunkahunka's spell).\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Hunkahunka was first revealed in a DVD bonus feature of ''[[Stitch! The Movie]]'' in the experiment gallery.\n*Hunkahunka is named after a lyric in the [[Elvis Presley]]\u00a0song \"[[Burning Love]]\", played in [[Lilo & Stitch|the original movie]]. Lilo refers to him as a \"Hunkahunka bird of love.\"\n*Hunkahunka was activated off-screen.\n*In\u00a0[[Hunkahunka (episode)|his debut]], Hunkahunka had dark purple feathers. However,\u00a0in [[Aloha, E Komo Mai|the show's intro]], the episode \"[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]\", and his later appearances, he had dark pink and maroon feathers on his body.\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Birds]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Matchmakers]]"
