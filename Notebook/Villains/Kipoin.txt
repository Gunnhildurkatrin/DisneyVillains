He is a goat herder who is [[Morogo]]'s father.\n== Role ==\nAfter the trio encounters a rhino, Kipoin is displeased his son is keeping company with Americans, because they are \u201ccattle eaters.\u201d He is even more disgusted to learn they eat fish.\n\nTwo days after the trio head off to save Duma, Kipoin goes to the tracking station to tell Earl his children have run off with Morogo. After calling the grandmother, Earl realizes Ted may have been right about Patel. The fathers go to the store and force Patel\u2019s cousin to reveal his whereabouts. After calling the police, they learn that Morogo\u2019s mother, Lani, visited Jean and both women have gone after Patel themselves.\n\nWhen the parents get to the police station and are told the children ran off, Earl sees a flier for the race and realizes they are heading for Nairobi. The children reach the racetrack in time to hear the cheetah-greyhound race being announced. Patel crows to Nigel that he has bet a fortune that Duma will lose. Duma takes an early lead in the race, but as the race progresses, the greyhounds catch up and pass the cat. Ted grabs a policeman\u2019s whistle and blows. Hearing the whistle, Duma gets a second wind and wins by five lengths, causing Patel and Nigel to pay off all bets. The parents arrive just as Duma attacks Abdullah, and Earl pulls the cheetah off him. As both sets of parents berate their children for being irresponsible, the poacher is arrested.\n\nLater, the family releases Duma into the wild in \u201cCheetah Valley.\u201d As Susan removes Duma\u2019s collar, a male cheetah appears and Duma runs toward him. Susan quotes a Kenyan adage, \u201cThough they are separated, their spirits still share the same earth and sky.\"\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:African characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Cheetah characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
