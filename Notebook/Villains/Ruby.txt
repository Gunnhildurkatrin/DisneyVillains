She is one of the members of the Junkyard Dogs.\n\n==Background==\n===Physical Description===\nRuby is an [[wikipedia:Afghan Hound|Afghan Hound]] who greatly resembles Sylvie from the film ''[[wikipedia:Balto (film)|Balto]]''. She lives among [[Buster (Lady and the Tramp)|Buster]]'s gang of Junkyard Dogs.\n\n===Personality===\nRuby seems to have a disturbing attraction to [[Scamp]]. It may be because she's one of [[Tramp]]'s past girlfriends, or so she says. She even admits to Scamp she has \"a bad case of puppy love.\" Ruby eventually leaves [[The Junkyard|the junkyard]] with the other Junkyard Dogs\u00a0minus Buster, and gets adopted by a family.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Ruby's attraction to Scamp is similar to [[Tito]]'s attraction to [[Georgette]] in ''[[Oliver & Company]]''.\n*Ruby's \"puppy love\" may stem from the fact that she likes puppies in general.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\n12372-29391.jpg\n344871_1261399200488_full.jpg\npic_detail4c6522c6e233e.png|Ruby with [[Scratchy]] and [[Mooch]]\n346036 1261575615523 full.jpg|Ruby howling with the other Junkyard Dogs\nLady-tramp-2-disneyscreencaps.com-7487.jpg|Ruby and the other junkyard dogs with their new owners\n</gallery>\n\n{{Lady and the Tramp}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Lady and the Tramp characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]"
