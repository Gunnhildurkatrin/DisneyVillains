She is the first genie to attend Witch University, and the student dorm advisor.\n\nWhen Marnie accepted the \"Gift\", Aneesa was controlled for a brief time and helped Marnie destroy the gift forever with by sealing it in her magic lamp, which was destroyed by Marine, Dylan and Gwen in a slight of hand to make everyone think the Gift was destroyed. At the end of the movie with Aneesa's lamp gone, she says she needs a new place to stay and Marnie offers to have her as a roommate.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nGenie-lamp.gif|Aneesa's Lamp\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n* Aneesa's room was empty except for the lamp, which could mean she transferred all the furniture into her lamp. This makes some viewers wonder what her home is like.\n* Despite genies being magical beings, Aneesa isn't shown using any magic aside from putting things inside her lamp.\n* Her outfits are stereotypical genie clothing.\n\n\n\n{{Halloweentown}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Genies]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Semitic characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Halloweentown characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel Original Movie Characters]]"
