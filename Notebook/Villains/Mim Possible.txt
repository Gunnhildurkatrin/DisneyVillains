She was accused of stealing a machine made by [[Professor Demens]], supposed ancestor of [[Professor Dementor]].\n\n==Notes==\n*As with ''everything depicted in the episode'', except the final few moments after Kim and Ron wake to discover it was all a dream, it is highly questionable if Mim was \"real\".\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Possible, Mim}}\n\n{{Template:Kim Possible}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Kim Possible characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
