When it comes to energy manipulations, she can out-glow anyone! But, sometimes she says things without thinking and then falls all over herself apologizing. Confident and lightheartedly luminous, Sage always looks on the bright side and naturally attracts others into her orbit. ''\n\n===Personality===\nDescribing Sage's personality, she is honest, adventurous, curious, optimistic, friendly, light-hearted, luminous, confident and relaxed. On the other hand of her personality, she can also be restless, quick-tempered (that she has a quick temper), irresponsible, and too trusting of others' opinions and she may jump to conclusions.\n\n=== Powers and abilities ===\nShe plays the guitar in the Star Darlings band.\n\n==Appearance==\nSage\u2019s theme color is lavender purple. She is a teenage girl with light tan skin, lavender eyes, lips, and hair held loose. In the series, her hair is held into two long braids. Her outfit consists of a long lavender dress with a star design, purple leggings, and boots. Her accessories consists of a silver tiara-like headband with a star sharped gem in the middle and her star-charmed necklace.\n\nOn Earth, Sage\u2019s appearance changes to look like a normal human. Her hair color changes to dark brown with only a streak of purple. Her skin loses its sparkle and her outfit changes to look more human. The only item that remains the same is her star-charmed necklace.\n\n==Trivia==\n* Sage is named after [[wikipedia:Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]] (\u2650), the ninth of the twelve astrological signs of the zodiac, which means the archer.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nDisney's Star Darlings - Sage - Profile Picture.jpeg\nStar-Darlings-post.jpg\nStar Darlings 01.jpeg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Star Darlings}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Star Darlings characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]"
