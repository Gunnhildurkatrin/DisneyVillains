Even though generally Uno limits his function to the 151st secret floor, he actually is the whole tower, and can control any part of it.\n\nWhen Ducklair Tower is bought by [[Scrooge McDuck]], he hires his nephew [[Donald]] to be its custodian and caretaker until there's enough tenants bringing their own staffs. Donald finds the 151st floor and investigates as [[The Duck Avenger]], so he meets Uno, who becomes his ally and gives him access to Everett Ducklair's inventions.\n\nVery few people besides the Duck Avenger knows about Uno's existence.\n\n==Odin Eidolon==\nIn adventures where the Duck Avenger travels to the 23th century, he gets help from Odin Eidolon, one of the richest and most powerful men of that time, and owner of the market's leading droid manufacturing factory. Neither the Duck Avenger nor the world in general know that Eidolon is actually the future self of Uno, who managed (or will manage, from the relative point of view) to transfer himself to a robotic body in the year 2186.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nUno-outoftheshadows.JPG|Uno in the videogame.\nPK &amp; Uno - outoftheshadowsending.JPG|The Duck Avenger and Uno relax after defeating the Evronians.\nDonald_watches_Star_Wars.jpg|Donald ignores Uno to watch a Star Wars-like film\nOdin_Eidolon.jpg|Odin Eidolon\n</gallery>\n\n{{PKNA}}\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Deuteragonists]]\n[[Category:Machines]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Programs]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]"
