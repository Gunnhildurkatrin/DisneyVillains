He appears in the \"[[Rhapsody in Blue]]\" sequence. He is often wishing to find a job, and in the end, he starts working the night shift at the construction site.\n\n==Role in the film==\nJoe is first seen ordering coffee from a cafeteria and when he finds out that he does not have any money, one of the customers helps pay his order. Later while looking for a job, he then attempts to put an apple that he found on his way at the grocery store, but a police officer drives him away. During a montage where the characters are wishing for their dreams to come true, Joe wishes that he had a job so that he could be hired like [[Duke (Fantasia)|Duke]] who was hired as a construction worker. During the end of the segment when Duke leaves the construction site, he gives the jackhammer to Joe and he feels satisfied that he finally found a job, making his wish come true.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"180\" position=\"center\">\nfantasia2000-disneyscreencaps.com-2183.jpg\nFantasia2000-disneyscreencaps.com-2253.jpg\nF2000 34.png\nFantasia2000-disneyscreencaps.com-2562.jpg\nfantasia2000-disneyscreencaps.com-2564.jpg\nXDqady.gif\nfantasia2000-disneyscreencaps.com-2580.jpg\nfantasia2000-disneyscreencaps.com-2582.jpg\nfantasia2000-disneyscreencaps.com-2863.jpg\nfantasia2000-disneyscreencaps.com-2872.jpg\nfantasia2000-disneyscreencaps.com-2949.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-2962.jpg\nFantasia2000-disneyscreencaps.com-2964.jpg\nF2000 43.png\nfantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-2974.jpg\nfantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-2981.jpg\nfantasia2000-disneyscreencaps.com-3214.jpg\nfantasia2000-disneyscreencaps.com-3220.jpg\nfantasia2000-disneyscreencaps.com-3222.jpg\nfantasia2000-disneyscreencaps.com-3228.jpg\nfantasia2000-disneyscreencaps.com-3230.jpg\nF2000 50.png\nfantasia2000-disneyscreencaps.com-3240.jpg\nfantasia2000-disneyscreencaps.com-3353.jpg\nfantasia2000-disneyscreencaps.com-3430.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Fantasia}}\n[[Category:Fantasia characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
