Initially, Sir Giles believes that the dragon</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> must have caused the boy</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> some kind of misery and woe and begins to make various guesses as to what it is, from </span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">devouring the boy's</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> flocks to making off with his parents, to kidnapping some fair damsel with flaxen hair, ruby lips, and form divine. The boy</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> simply states that the dragon</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> won't fight, to which Sir Giles says \"Preposterous! the fellow must be an infernal cad. Bit of a rotter, what?\". The boy</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> then explains that the dragon</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> is</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> actually a nice old dragon who likes to write poetry; much to Sir Giles' joy, as he's a bit of a bard himself. He then starts reciting a poem called \"Ode to a Fleecy Cloud\"; which causes the boy</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> to realize that he is much the opposite of the way knights are portrayed in his storybook. Nevertheless, Sir Giles agrees to go with the boy to talk to the dragon</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> about the fight.</span>\n\nThe boy<span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> and Sir Giles find the dragon</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> </span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">having a picnic, which he invites them to join. When the boy</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> introduces Sir Giles as the dragon killer, the dragon</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> is so shocked that he angrily picks up all the picnic items and puts them back in his basket. However, when Sir Giles tells him that the boy</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> told him that he is an accomplished poet, the dragon</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> is flattered and quickly hands back all of the picnic food. Sir Giles then asks the dragon</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> to recite a poem, to which he relates \"To an upside-down cake\" which Sir Giles likes very much. Sir Giles then recites his own poem entitled \"Radish so red\", which the dragon</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> finds delightful.</span>\n\nHowever, this whole time. the boy<span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> has been wanting Sir Giles to tell the dragon</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> about the fight,</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> so he proceeds to do so with his own poem. The dragon</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> is shocked and refuses to fight since there's nothing to fight and he doesn't believe in it. Although both Sir Giles and the boy</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> tell him that the whole village is expecting a fight and that they will be severely disappointed if there isn't one, the dragon</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> still refuses and </span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">goes into his cave home, bidding them goodnight.</span>\n\nThen, Sir Giles comes up with an idea: he will fake the fight so that neither he nor the dragon<span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> will get hurt. After consulting the boy's</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> book and seeing that there's nothing against it, the boy</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> </span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">and the dragon</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> both agree to his plan.</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> However, at the last minute, the dragon</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> remembers that he can't breathe fire and </span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">tries to change his friends' minds, but the boy</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> and Sir Giles have already left.</span>\n\nThat following morning as the villagers gathered outside the dragon's cave<span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> to watch the fight, Sir Giles rides in on horseback, clad in armor, ready for the fight. Inside the cave, the dragon</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> and the boy</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> are both very distressed because the fight can't take place as</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> no matter how hard he tries, the dragon</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> can't get himself to </span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">breathe fire. However, when the boy</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> states that he wishes that the dragon</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> was a real dragon instead of a</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> \"punk poet,\" the dragon</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> gets</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> angry and finally starts to breathe fire. Delighted, the dragon</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> asks</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> the boy</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> to call him a \"punk poet\" multiple times so that he can get madder and his fire can get bigger.</span>\n\nThe \"fight\" begins with Sir Giles <span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">charging at the dragon, who manages to hide in a cloud of smoke he created</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">. Sir Giles then chases the dragon</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> into his cave, where they proceed to fan the smoke from a fire out the entrance and shout things like \"Take that!\" and \"Help!\", all while having some tea; much to Sir Giles' horse's dismay.</span>\n\nA little later, the two resume the \"fight\" outside, where they proceed to charge at each other again. After the collision, <span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">another cloud of smoke is created, in which the dragon and Sir Giles dance while shouting the same things over again; much to the horse's dismay again. Then, they both decide it is time for the dragon</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> to \"die\", so they end their fake fight with the dragon</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> pretending he has been stabbed by Sir Giles' spear. After that, Sir Giles \"reforms the ferocious dragon\" and the dragon</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> is finally welcomed into society.</span>\n\n===[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]===\nHe appears in ToonTown chasing the Dragon on his horse after Eddie crashes his car. Sir Giles, his horse, and the dragon<span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"> join the rest of the toons as Roger Rabbit reads Marvin Acme's will and rejoices knowing Marvin kept his word and left ToonTown to the Toons. He then heads back home to ToonTown knowing it will be safe from future harm, singing \"Smile, Darn Ya, Smile!\" with the other toons.</span>\n\n===[[House of Mouse]]===\nSir Giles makes many cameos in ''[[House of Mouse]]'', usually seen sitting with the Dragon. He appears multiple times in the shows intro clapping with the other toons as the show is about to start.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nTheReluctantDragonslip.jpg|Sir Giles hilariously slipping\n32308.jpg|Sir Giles and the boy on a picnic with the Reluctant Dragon\n32309.jpg|\"Thank you.\"\n32311.jpg|Sir Giles and the boy talking with the Reluctant Dragon about the fight\n32312.jpg|Sir Giles whispering a plan to the Reluctant Dragon\n32313.jpg|Sir Giles and the Reluctant Dragon observing the rules in the boy's book about knight-dragon fights\nTheReluctantDragonGiles.jpg|\"By Jove!\"\nThe.Reluctant.Dragon1.jpg|Sir Giles looking for the Reluctant Dragon in a cloud of smoke\nThe.Reluctant.Dragon2.jpg|Sir Giles wondering where the Reluctant Dragon disappeared to\nThe.Reluctant.Dragonspook.jpg|Sir Giles surprised by the Reluctant Dragon\nThe.Reluctant.Dragon3.jpg|Sir Giles chasing the Reluctant Dragon into his cave\n32314.jpg|Sir Giles and the Reluctant Dragon faking the fight\nThe.Reluctant.Dragon4.jpg|\"Egad!\"\nTheReluctantDragonDance.jpg|Sir Giles and the Reluctant Dragon faking the fight again in a cloud of smoke while dancing\nTheReluctantDragonFightOver.jpg|Sir Giles \"triumphant\"\nTheReluctantDragonwelcome.jpg|Sir Giles, the Boy, and the villagers welcoming the Reluctant Dragon into society\nJanuary15th.png|Sir Giles' page in ''[[Disneystrology]]''\nHouse Of Mouse - House Of Crime Guests.jpg|Sir Giles with the Reluctant Dragon and the boy in ''[[House of Mouse]]''\nChasingdonald.jpg\nSir Giles-model01.jpg\nSir Giles-model02.jpg\nSir Giles-model03.jpg\nSirGilesColorKey.png|Color key drawing of Sir Giles\nVlcsnap-2015-07-18-10h49m43s262.png\nVlcsnap-2015-07-18-10h50m37s787.png\nVlcsnap-2015-07-18-10h50m56s207.png\nVlcsnap-2015-07-18-10h51m22s326.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{House of Mouse}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Giles, Sir}}\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Knights]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:English characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Who Framed Roger Rabbit cameos]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:The Reluctant Dragon characters]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Horsemen]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]"
