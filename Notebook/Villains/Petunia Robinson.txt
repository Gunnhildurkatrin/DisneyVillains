She is a hand puppet controlled by [[Fritz Robinson|Fritz]].\n\n==Physical appearance ==\nPetunia is a wooden hand puppet with tan skin, short auburn hair, and black eyes with purple eyelashes. The light blue stuff on her arms resembles a spring toy. She is seen wearing blue stud earrings and a green sleeveless dress with a white collar and two red buttons in the middle.\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*Since she's a puppet on [[Fritz Robinson|Fritz]]'s hand, there are several ideas what this could mean:\n**She's a split personality in Fritz's mind and the puppet is just a way to focus the personality.\n** It actually has a human mind inside it, but Fritz needs to move it so she can speak.\n**It's a substitute for his wife, who has either died or divorced him and left him mentally shattered.\n* Given that Fritz has two children, Tallulah and Laszlo, the 3rd seems more accurate, although they could be adopted.\n**The second, while possible, is unlikely, due to Fritz generally speaking out of this corner of the mouth, while he moves the puppet.\n*When she goes for a drive, she usually takes the Harley, according to [[Bud Robinson|Grampa Bud]].\ufeff\n\n==Quotes==\n\n*\"Don't you sweetie me!
