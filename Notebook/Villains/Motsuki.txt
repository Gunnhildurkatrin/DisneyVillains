She is an antagonist (but also, like her big sister, an anti-hero) in the television series\u00a0''PJ Masks''.\n\nMotsuki first appeared in \"Moon Madness\", as one of [[Luna Girl]]'s many\u00a0[[Moths (PJ Masks)|moths]]. After helping Luna Girl steal the\u00a0Moon Crystal\u00a0from\u00a0[[PJ Masks Headquarters]], Luna Girl decided to promote her to her new henchman, and used the crystal to give her a name, a new appearance, and some powers. Then in \"[[Moth on the Moon]]\", Motsuki decided to go to the Moon to become Luna Girl's new sister by forming a strange\u00a0Moon Crystal\u00a0in a cave to hibernate, fueled by negative energy, to hatch her into a humanoid-like moth.\n\n== Physical appearance ==\n\n=== Current ===\nMotsuki is teal in appearance, wears a lilac and purple suit with a pink crystal on it. She has four arms, wings, pink eyeballs, purple eyes and purple eyelids.\n\n=== Henchman ===\nBefore being transformed into a humanoid, Motsuki was largely identical to Luna Girl\u2019s typical\u00a0moths. However, she has glowing marks all over her body and wings, and on her forehead is a glowing moon mark. When using her sensing power, her eyes are glowing pink.\n\n=== Original ===\nAnd before being promoted as Luna Girl's henchgirl, Motsuki was originally a regular moth, identical to the other moths with no physical difference to her at all.\n\n== Personality ==\nMotsuki's personality has changed with each transformation:\n\nOriginally, when she was a normal moth and later a henchman, she was very loyal to Luna Girl. Unlike other moths, she was smart, cunning, and sneaky, but also very bossy. She can be pretty fast as she is seen being chased by\u00a0PJ Robot\u00a0and then trapping him inside the\u00a0HQ\u2019s vault, and she is more focused than the other moths, who are usually distracted. However, like Luna Girl, she has a soft side.\n\nHowever, after being transformed into a humanoid-like moth that now serves as Luna Girl's sister, she became much more demanding and bratty towards Luna Girl. Rather than serve her, Motsuki now frequently argues with Luna and treats her as a baby than her sister, but she still loves and cares about her.\n\n== Powers and abilities ==\nMotsuki originally had no powers, but after coming to the moon and becoming her henchman, Luna Girl gave her the following powers:\n* '''Beam''': She can shoot a beam from her antennae or the red crystal embedded from her chest, and trap her opponents.\n* '''Sensing Power''': Allows her to track an opponent nearby.\n* '''Lunar Crystal Sensing''': Motsuki has the power to sense any moon crystal.\nHowever, the following powers replaced the previous powers she originally got from Luna Girl after she hatched into a humanoid-moth girl with the use of the harvest moon crystal:\n* '''Moon Bubble''': An upgraded version of her Beam power that allows her to shoot a beam from her antennae that can trap opponents in moon bubbles.\n* '''Teleportation:'''\u00a0Motsuki can teleport herself from Earth to the moon, and back again.\n\n* '''Crystal Summoning:'''\u00a0Motsuki can make crystals grow from the ground to trap anyone, including Luna Girl.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* She is the first moth to come with\u00a0[[Luna Girl]]\u00a0to the\u00a0moon.\n* Her gender is first revealed when Luna Girl called her \"she.\"\n* She is the first moth to gain powers.\n* She is also the first moth to be given a name by Luna Girl.\n** If the syllable \"mo\" is eliminated, the remaining syllables left together are \"tsuki\", which is a Japanese word for \"moon\".\n* She is revealed to be Luna Girl\u2019s most favorite moth.\n* She is shown to become the official leader of Luna Girl's moths, as she is seen leading them in \"Glowy Moths\".\n* She seems to be bigger than the other\u00a0moths.\n* She is the second henchman to have a name that starts with M.\n** The first henchman with a name that starts with the letter M is one of\u00a0[[Night Ninja]]<nowiki/>\u2019s\u00a0[[Ninjalinos]], Maxime/Marvin.\n* She is seen communicating with Luna Girl more often than the other moths in the the human language, though it sounds muffled.\n* Before her second transformation, Motsuki\u2019s chin moves whenever she talks or laughs as her mouth was not visible, just like\u00a0Night Ninja\u00a0and the\u00a0Ninjalinos\u2019 chins.\n* In \"Moon Madness\", Motsuki is referred by her alternate name \"Papinuit\" in the French dub (temporarily) and the French website of the\u00a0PJ Masks\u00a0by the\u00a0PJ Masks.\n** However, from then on in \"Moth on the Moon\", the trio would start calling her by her U.S. nickname instead.\n* Unlike the other moths whose eyes are closed when in a group, Motsuki is the only moth with her eyes opened.\n* In \"Moth on the Moon\", she is rebirthed into a moth girl after forming a moon crystal to hibernate in a cave on the\u00a0Moon.\n** She was made that way because of the PJ Masks arguing throughout the episode, from when Greg tipped over Amaya's telescope, all the way to after they've landed on the moon and rode their PJ Rovers to the cave.\n*** The latter was according to Luna since we've seen the PJs stop arguing before they went to the moon: \"My job was to send you here arguing all the way.\"\n* Since she can now talk, Motsuki will sometimes ends her sentences with a loud, moth-like squeak.\n** Similar to\u00a0[[Robot (PJ Masks)|Robot's]] manner in the French dub of the show, she also speaks using third-person, though at first she spoke properly, and occasionally says \"me\" instead of her name when referring to herself.\n* Motsuki is the second character not to have her name omitted in the French dub of the PJ Masks, but the name was repurposed as a nickname instead while her real name is known as \"Papinuit\".\n** The first character was\u00a0[[Cameron (PJ Masks)|Cameron]].\n* Since her initial appearance, some fans of the\u00a0books'\u00a0TV adaptation\u00a0misbelieved that Motsuki's name was \"Mothzuki\" or \"Mothsuki\", this was eventually resolved when her actual name was revealed in title cards of episodes (though some of the fans remained adamant).\n* Motsuki bears close resemblance to the scrapped character, [[Firefly (PJ Masks)|Firefly]].\n[[Category:PJ Masks characters]]\n[[Category:Character stubs]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]"
