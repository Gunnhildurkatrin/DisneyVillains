Nosedive is by far the team's most impulsive and immature member who is similar to Michelangelo of the ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles''. His character may have been influenced by Michelangelo\u2014the two series were initially penned by the same writer. Nosedive is more childish and easy-going than the other Ducks, and often looks toward his older brother for support and protection. Nosedive can be very likable, making friends with teammate [[Check \"Grin\" Hardwing|Grin]], and humans [[Thrash & Mookie|Thrash and Mookie]]. He wears body armor, but not as much as Wildwing. He usually uses a Puck Blaster and rides a Duckcycle. His jersey number is 33.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink|Nosedive Flashblade/Gallery}}\n==References==\n<references />{{DEFAULTSORT:Flashblade, Nosedive}}\n\n{{The Mighty Ducks}}\n[[Category:Mighty Ducks (TV show) characters]]\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Superheroes]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Tritagonists]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]"
