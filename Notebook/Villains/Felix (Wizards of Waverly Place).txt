Felix caught the [[Captain Jim Bob Sherwood|Captain Jim Bob]] submarine out of [[Mason Greyback|Mason's]] mouth. He usually leads the delinquents in cheers. He helped [[Alex Russo|Alex]] and Justin out of a terrible fate. Occasionally, he picks up Justin when they are both leaving somewhere. Felix finds Alex cute. He was the only one to be able to take the wand out of the plasma ball making him the \"chosen one.\"\n\nFelix lives on the same 13th floor with Alex and [[Harper Finkle|Harper]] in \"[[Wizards of Apartment 13B]]\" and loses his wand in \"[[Get Along, Little Zombie]]\", where Dexter (which is [[Gorog]] the King of Darkness in disguise) comes up the elevator and reveals that he took it, then he convinces Felix to come to the dark side. He later does Gorog's bidding until he was freed. Also, it is seen he has a crush on Alex, as he kind of flirts with her. Felix is portrayed by Frank Pacheco.\n\n{{Wizards of Waverly Place}}\n[[Category:Wizards of Waverly Place Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
