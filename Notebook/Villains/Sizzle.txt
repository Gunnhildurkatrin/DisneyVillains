She is [[Crackle]]'s childhood rival.\n==Role in the [[Sofia the First|series]]==\nSizzle makes her debut appearance in \"[[The Royal Dragon]]\". She first appears as an attendee of the annual Roast N' Toast with other dragons including Crackle and [[Cinder]], and her aunt, the Duchess. Sizzle spends much of her time at the Roast N Toast competing with Crackle for the other dragons attention, showing off her talents, and bragging about stuff her aunt has been teaching her. When this makes Crackle say that [[Sofia the First (character)|Sofia]] is the Royal Dragon of [[Enchancia]], Sizzle is the only dragon who doesn't fawn over her and who is unimpressed with her excellent flying. Suddenly, Crackle attempts to do the Quadruple Loop de Spin only to mess it up and crash into Sofia. The crash reveals that Sofia is really a human girl which makes Sizzle realize and reveal that Crackle was lying about everything. When Crackle tells the group about [[Sir Oliver]], Sizzle dismisses her warnings as another lie only to learn that Crackle is telling the truth and is the only dragon who doesn't get trapped. Crackle urges her to free their friends with the skills her aunt had been teaching her which makes Sizzle admit that her aunt hadn't been teaching her anything and that everything she said about herself were also just tall tales she made up for the same reason Crackle made up hers and the two dragons reconcile and save the others.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"180\">\nThe Royal Dragon 12.png\nThe Royal Dragon 8.png\nThe Royal Dragon 10.png\nThe Royal Dragon 20.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Sofia the First}}\n[[Category:Sofia the First characters]]\n[[Category:Character stubs]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Dragons]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Nieces]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
