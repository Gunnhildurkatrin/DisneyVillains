He is about 110-years-old.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Just like all of the other characters' ancestors, Wayne looks identical to Wade when he was young.\n\n==Notes==\n*As with ''everything depicted in the episode'', except the final few moments after Kim and Ron wake to discover it was all a dream, it is highly questionable if Wayne was \"real\".\n\n==Gallery==\n\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nScreen shot 2011-10-16 at 12 41 53 AM.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Kim Possible}}\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wayne}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Kim Possible characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Grandparents]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]"
