She is designed to make people dance until they drop with her infectious Latin beats.\n\n==Background==\n===Physical appearance===\nCarmen is a pink, blue-eyed, four-armed, [[Angel]]-like experiment with a red nose and dark purple-tipped ears, wearing a headdress of fruit and holding a maraca in each of her four hands.\n\nCarmen has dark pink fur with splashes of light pink fur on her limbs. Her belly is also light pink. She is somewhat curvier than Angel, but her legs are the shortest of any other experiment with a similar build. She keeps all four of her long arms exposed at all times. Her eyes and tongue are a robin's-egg blue. Two short antennae extend just beneath her ears. Her most outstanding feature is the fruit salad she wears on her head, which includes bananas, grapes, oranges, cherries, and pineapples. She also carries four festive maracas at all times that help her carry out her primary function.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nCarmen makes people dance until they drop by firing pink balls of energy out of her maracas that pop when they take effect. She can also cancel the effect by clapping the maracas together.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment 123 was the 123rd genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]] 's funding.\u00a0She was designed to make people dance until they drop.\u00a0123 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.\n\nAt some point, 123 was activated, captured, tamed, and named Carmen.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nThe first 624 experiments, including Carmen, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, Lilo, Stitch, Jumba, Pleakley, Reuben, and Gantu arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nCarmen participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]], as in one scene, Carmen was seen strangling a Leroy.\n\nHowever, the Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.\n\n===''[[Stitch!]]''===\nCarmen made an appearance in the ''Stitch!'' anime when [[Stitch]], [[Pleakley]], and [[Yuna Kamihara|Yuna]] travel to the past to the day Stitch was created. She was used to allow them to make their escape by making [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]] and his forces dance uncontrollably. It is shown that she does this by firing pink balls of energy out of her maracas.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Carmen was first revealed in a pre-release promo image for ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]'' that was identical to the group photo at the end of the film.\n*Her name is a reference to {{WikipediaLink|Carmen Miranda}}, a world-famous [[Brazil]]ian singer and dancer of the early 20th century well known for wearing a headdress of tropical fruits and her use of maracas.\n*Carmen is one of the rare experiments to not have black eyes like most experiments, having light blue eyes instead.\n*In a brief scene of ''Leroy & Stitch'' during the \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\" concert, a towering, rather monstrous version of Carmen can be seen in the background. This version of her has a slightly elongated face; two long arms with larger hands and extended claws; a long, narrow torso; and what seems to be back spines that are extended similarly to [[Stitch]]'s spines. Perhaps Carmen also has a \"metamorphosis\" programming like Stitch.\n*Carmen's\u00a0[[Experiment Pods|pod]] color is red in the ''[[Stitch!]]'' anime.\n**Jumba also refers to Carmen as \"a doozie\" in the anime for unspecified reasons.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nScreenCapture 28.01.13 16-12-49.jpg|Carmen's experiment pod\nVlcsnap-2013-02-08-11h58m00s88.png\nscreenCapture 17.06.13 20-22-46.jpg\nVlcsnap-2012-07-03-21h18m36s224.png\nVlcsnap-2013-04-15-07h27m59s93.png\nVlcsnap-2013-05-21-14h09m47s96.png\nVlcsnap-2013-04-03-21h41m26s43.png\nVlcsnap-2013-07-22-19h02m58s54.png\nvlcsnap-2012-10-05-22h00m16s33.png\nVlcsnap-2013-04-03-22h33m07s232.png\nVlcsnap-2012-08-02-19h20m01s228.png\nVlcsnap-2012-08-02-19h21m37s94.png\nvlcsnap-2013-02-08-12h12m22s125.png|A monstrous version of Carmen can be seen in the background\nScreenCapture 03.04.13 14-16-57.jpg\nVlcsnap-2012-07-03-22h16m18s43.png\nCarmen.png|Carmen in ''Stitch!'' anime\nscreenCapture 19.02.13 23-23-50.jpg\nscreenCapture 19.02.13 23-20-51.jpg\nscreenCapture 19.02.13 23-23-08.jpg\nscreenCapture 19.02.13 23-24-54.jpg\nUnknownpink.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Dancers]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
