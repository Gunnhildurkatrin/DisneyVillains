She is the Princess of\u00a0Para\u00edso.\n\n\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nValentina is shown to have a very competitive personality to the point where, as noted by Elena, she turns everything into a competition.\n\n===Physical Appearance===\nValentina is a teenager who is around Elena's age. Her signature color seems to be dark pink.\n\n==Role in the Series==\nPrincess Valentina makes her debut in \"[[Royal Rivalry]]\". She gets very competitive with Elena in an attempt to prove the Kingdom of\u00a0Para\u00edso is better than the Kingdom of Avalor which eventually causes trouble. In reality, Valentina was trying to be as impressive as Elena, as she was feeling inadequate to her when she saw that all the stories she heard about Elena were true.\n\nPrincess Valentina makes her second appearance in 'The Incredible Shrinking Royals' where she attends the feast as her father, King Santiago, says she needs more diplomatic experience to be a great queen. \n\nTo everyone's horror, King Hector shows up due to being secretly invited by Esteban and Dona Paloma. Julio leads everyone inside the Sunbird Temple and explains that the Maruvians held all their matters of diplomacy in the Temple as it has a magic that gets unleashed whenever anyone is loud and rude, thus requiring all attending to be civil and quiet. Hector is loud, rude, and obnoxious the whole time which culminates in him throwing a tantrum when Queen Abigail sits at the head of the table, the spot he always wants. This causes the magic to get unleashed and everyone except Julio and Carmen, who are both outside, to shrink down to the size of dolls. \n\nWhen Carmen and Julio get back, they discover what happened. Julio sends Carmen to get Mateo. A crayfish gets loose and attacks the group. Julio rescues everyone with the replica of Hector's Wave Smasher and by using a thread from one of Abigal's dresses as rope. Mateo restores the Royals to their proper sizes and they agree to sign the treaty and the Feast of Friendship resumes. \n\nPrincess Valentina makes a cameo appearance at the start of the following episode, '[[Norberg Peace Prize]]' , leaving Avalor with King Toshi, Queen Abigail and King Hector after the Feast of Friendship. \n\nIn '[[The Birthday Cruise]]', Elena invites Mateo, Princess Valentina and Princess Rebecca to celebrate Princess Chloe's birthday by going on an all-day cruise. Chloe is prone to seasickness but decides to go anyway to make her new friends happy. She asks Valentina what she does for fun in Para\u00edso and Valentina gladly introduces her favorite party game, Zestaball, where players hit the ball back and forth without using their hands until one of them wraps the rope all the way around the pole. Valentina kicks the ball until it ends up tying Chloe to the pole. Elena then suggests they play a game less competitive. Later, the group sees an area of magical fog. Valentina suggests they take a closer look. Chloe gets reminded of an old legend about a cursed sea nymph but agrees to check it out to please her friends. Suddenly, the ship goes into stormy weather and soon hits land.\u00a0 Rebecca mentions that according to the map, there's not supposed to be an island anywhere there. Valentina eagerly suggests they explore the island but Elena says first they need to check the hull to make sure it's not damaged. Chloe says that they should probably all wait on the boat or maybe even leave, but Mateo says they won't get anywhere until the storm passes. Valentina then asks Chloe where her sense of adventure is, and Chloe agrees to explore the island. Valentina says the island is a wreck. Suddenly, Maliga, the cursed sea nymph appears. When the group finds out that Chloe knows about her, Valentina asks her why she didn't tell them. Chloe explains that she wasn't sure the legend was real and she didn't want to ruin the party.\u00a0 Maliga wants a party and declares that she will not let anyone leave her island. The group tries to flee but Maliga stops them with her powers. She demands they throw her a party and Elena and Chloe go to fetch presents while Mateo, Valentina and Rebecca are forced to braid her hair. The group tries to trick Maliga. They carry her on a chair to her island and Valentina kicks her Zestaball until it ties Maliga to the chair. The group attempts to flee on their ship again. Maliga is furious and causes the waters above the ship to rise. However, Maliga can't reach the ship due to being sealed by a magical barrier.\u00a0 Maliga weeps that all she wanted was a friend. Chloe can relate and dives towards Maliga. Chloe agrees to stay with Maliga forever if she lets the rest of her friends go. Maliga lowers the waters and is touched by Chloe's kindness that she frees Chloe as well. This act of kindness allows Maliga's curse to be broken, her magical barrier is removed, and she returns home with two other nymphs.\u00a0 Chloe confesses that she is scared of heights, not good at sports, doesn't like magic, and sailing makes her want to heave. Her friends however, tell her that's not what matters and complement her for her bravery. Valentina tells Chloe she is a hero. Elena says this time, they will do what Chloe wants, and after a squeeze (hug), they dance the Norberg Jig with Chloe.  \n\nIn the series finale, 'Coronation Day', Princess Valentina arrives in Avalor along with Princess Chloe, Princess Rebecca, and Prince Alonso. Princess Chloe asks Princess Elena if there is anything they can do to help and Elena says they are about to do a run-through. Just then, Mateo calls Elena and Elena says she will catch up with them later. After the Four Shades of Awesome are released, Naomi and Marisa tell Valentina, Chloe, Rebecca and Alonso that the whole kingdom is in danger and they readily agree to help. Valentina rides on her horse and is shocked to see King Hector as a butterfrog and several rulers acting chaotic in the park due to being attacked by the Animal and Chaos Shades. She, Rebecca and Chloe warn Isabel that the Shades are in the park, port and the mercado. Later, Valentina, Alonso and Ixlan are in the marketplace and plan to get rid of the Chaos Shade. Ixlan tries to defeat Vuli on her own, but falls victim to his Touch of Chaos. Valentina tries to cast an attack spell on Vuli with her tamborita but Vuli dodges it. Just then, Gabe, Naomi, Mateo and Isabel arrive on jaquins after defeating Hetz and they go after the chaotic Ixlan while Valentina continues to target the Chaos Shade. Yolo arrives and informs Vuli about Hetz's death, causing Vuli to burst into tears. This allows Valentina to blast Vuli, causing him to fall into a barrel. Yolo tries to strike Valentina, but Alonso takes the hit for her, causing Alonso to turn into a donkey. Alonso and Valentina then flee while Gabe, Naomi, Mateo and Isabel rush to the palace upon seeing the damage done by Cahu the Time Shade. \n\nLater, Elena's forgiveness magic restores Alonso to his human form and Valentina joyfully hugs him. Valentina is later seen at Elena's coronation and dances with Alonso as everyone celebrates. \n\n==Trivia==\n*Princess Valentina has an extremely long title.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nRoyal Rivalry 1.png\nRoyal Rivalry 2.png\nRoyal Rivalry 3.png\nA Little Bit More.jpg\nRoyal Rivalry 4.png\nRoyal Rivalry 5.png\nRoyal Rivalry 6.png\nRoyal Rivalry 7.png\nElena and shrunken royals.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Elena of Avalor}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Valentina, Princess}}\n[[Category:Elena of Avalor characters]]\n[[Category:Character stubs]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Princesses]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Horsemen]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
