Not much is known about them, not even their names.\n\n==Role in the series==\nNot long after Rose and her unnamed twin were born, Rose was taken away from her family by [[the Huntsclan]] after her dragon birthmark was identified by the doctors and was raised by them who told her that her parents were dead. They are not seen again until the [[Huntsman (American Dragon: Jake Long)|Huntsman]] used their safety to blackmail Rose when it becomes known she was a traitor, where they were seen on a video screen eating dinner. Rose cooperated, but in the end, once again betrayed the Huntsman by using the [[The 13 Aztec Skulls|Aztec Skulls]] to destroy the Huntsclan.\n\nIn an attempt to save Rose, [[Jake Long|Jake]] used the Aztec Skulls to wish Rose had never been kidnapped, thus putting her in a normal life with her parents. They moved to Hong Kong shortly after and are not seen again until Jake needs her help in defeating [[the Dark Dragon]].\n\n==Trivia==\n*Rose's parents are only seen in three episodes, and out of all those episodes, only Rose's mother had lines.\n*The gender of [[Rose]]'s twin is not indicated.\n*With allowance for art styles, Rose's father bears a striking resemblance to [[James Timothy Possible]] from ''Kim Possible''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nRose parents2.jpg|Rose's parents with their babies\nrosefamil 4313.PNG\nThe Rotwood Files (7).jpg\nHomecoming (11).jpg\nHomecoming (15).jpg\nDreamscape (9).jpg\nRose parents.jpg\nHomecoming (41).jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{American Dragon: Jake Long}}\n[[Category:American Dragon: Jake Long characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
