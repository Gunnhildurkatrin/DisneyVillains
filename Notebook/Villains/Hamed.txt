He was the founder of the city of [[Agrabah]] itself, thousands of years ago presumably.\n\n==Appearance==\nHamed is a tall man with a black beard and moustache and brown skin. He wears a turban and Nomadic clothes.\n\n==\"[[Lost and Founded]]\"==\n[[Aladdin (character)|Aladdin]] and his friends find Hamed and his caravan walking in a desert in a time before Agrabah existed. They tell Hamed to settle in the desert, to which he agrees. That night, he is tackled by [[Abis Mal]] and his ancestor [[Abnor Mal]] and gets thrown into an hourglass-shaped portal. Aladdin and [[Genie]] find Hamed stuck in a tar pit in a prehistoric landscape. After Hamed is brought back to the desert and Aladdin takes Abis' magic hourglass, the glass breaks and a giant portal sucks everyone in, where a battle ensues. Later, Hamed sees Agrabah from a portal and begins to understand Aladdin's suggestion. After Hamed returns to the desert again, Aladdin and his friends return to their own time period, and Abnor Mal is banished for his betrayal, Hamed and his group set off to find Agrabah.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink|Hamed}}\n{{Aladdin}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Aladdin characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Middle Eastern characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]"
