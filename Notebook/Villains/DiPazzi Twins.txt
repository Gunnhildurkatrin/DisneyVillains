But their personalities are not known very thoroughly, as they do not speak much and have only appeared in a few episodes with supporting roles. But they do have a crazy love for the colonies, and like to sneak into the Mellowbrook cinema and cheat and annoy him enough to Kick.\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nGetaloadofthatguy.jpg\nCharacters-gordietwins.jpg\nClothescall_kick&dipazzitwins.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Kick Buttowski: Suburban Daredevil}}\n[[Category:Kick Buttowski characters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Twins and Triplets]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
