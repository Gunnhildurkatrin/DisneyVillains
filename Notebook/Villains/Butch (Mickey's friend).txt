Under his boss, Butch and his screw had robbed [[Minnie Mouse]]'s farm of its eggs.\n\nMickey met Butch and his comrades whilst posing as a lost traveler and found them a surprisingly pleasant bunch. Mickey revealed to Butch and his crew that Slicker planned to run off with the loot and frame them(as well as Mickey) for the crimes they helped him commit.\n\nMickey managed to convince Butch and his friends helped bring Mr. Slicker to justice, though Butch was arrested with Slicker at the end of the story. As a later story revealed, Butch unexpectedly loved his new home, however when he heard over the radio that Mickey was in a boxing match against the deadly Creamo Catnera, (And got worked up over the program being interrupted by an ad) he decided to break out of jail, and help his old friend win the fight with a few brutish tricks.\n\nMickey could tell that Butch was a good guy, and so using his winnings he payed for his bail, in his custody he helped Butch to get back on his feet. After a few ore adventures his character was dropped from the strip, however he has returned on and off again since the 1990's. Butch and Mickey have remained friends ever since and often work together. Butch has not had a strong education but is very streetwise. Butch lives in a cabin in the woods outside of Mickey's home town.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"209\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nJeff Overturf FG 1001.jpg|Butch appeared alongside Mickey in this autographed \"photo\", sent to fans who wrote in during the \"High Society\" storyline.\n</gallery>\n\n== Notes ==\n* Butch's crew consists of a tall weasel named Snake and an unnamed short weasel.
