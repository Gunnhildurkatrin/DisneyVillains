Arizona has a weird habit of not using beds, doors, or stairs. Instead, he sleeps in a tent, enters and exits houses through windows, and climbs floors by a rope. Arizona is fond of a specific brand of liquorice candy (the brand is called ''Negritas ''in original Italian language version, Tuju in the Finnish language translation), which he never travels without and is addicted to the taste of, but which everyone else finds horrible. Arizona's car is an old jeep which he has named affectionately as Gippippa. Arizona has a rival archaeologist, Dr. Kranz, who is greedy and shameless, and not above resorting to criminal behavior.\nArizona Goof received his English name in his first American comics appearance ([[1991]]). In a couple of [[2005]]\u2013[[2006]] appearances, the character was inexplicably renamed \"Arizona Dipp.\" But more recent uses (Disney Digicomics, [[2009]]\u2013[[2010]]) have restored his traditional English name.  \nThe character Arizona Goof was created by writer Bruno Sarda and artist Massimo De Vita in [[1988]], as a spoof of the film character [[Indiana Jones]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nMMA1.jpg\n985025-indianapateta2 thumb.jpg\nGa12.jpg\n500full2.jpg\n718846 3dfigindianapipps.jpg\n1069411-ariz mick.jpg\n22 49065 0 GoofyAdventures13.jpg\nIndianaPipps.gif\n569166-indiana pipps large.jpg\nArizonaGoof.jpg\nArizona Goofy Toy.jpg\n</gallery>\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Goof, Arizona}}\n\n{{Wikipedia|Mickey Mouse universe}}\n[[Category:Articles with Wikipedia content]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]"
