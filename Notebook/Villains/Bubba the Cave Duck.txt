Encountered during an accidental trip into [[Duckburg]]'s prehistoric past, Bubba latched onto [[Scrooge McDuck]] after Scrooge accidentally saved him from a ferocious [[Tyrannosaurus Rex]]. Bubba and his pet Triceratops [[Tootsie the Triceratops|Tootsie]] stowed away on [[Gyro Gearloose]]'s time-ship, the Millennium Shortcut, which ran on a form of unstable energy called \"bombastium\", returning with Scrooge and crew to the present day.\n\nIn one episode Bubba was made smart, at first Scrooge was elated but he came to miss the old Bubba as he found the new Bubba to be cold and heartless.\n\nHe currently lives in a version of his old cave on the grounds of McDuck Manor and goes to school with [[Webby Vanderquack|Webby]], [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]].\n\n===[[DuckTales (2017 series)|''DuckTales'' (2017)]]===\n[[File:BubbaDuckTales2017.png|thumb|left|220x220px]]\nBubba reappears in the 2017 reboot along with Tootsie the Triceratops.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://youtu.be/-rTzuLFuDfE|website=YouTube|title=DuckTales - Season 2 Characters First Look SDCC 2018|date=July 20, 2018}}</ref> In the episode \"[[Timephoon!]]\", he is unintentionally pulled into the present by Louie Duck in an effort to collect treasures from the past to get rich. He spends the whole episode running amok throughout the house with Huey Duck angrily pointing out a variety of anachronistic characteristics he displays (such as riding a skateboard, being interested in chili dogs, using a club and riding Tootsie who was pulled from a different time period). He aids the McDuck family in sending everyone back to their proper times, including himself. Huey, Dewey, and Webby deduce, but then deny, that Bubba is actually their ancestor; explaining his unusual talents. Back in the past, he carves himself a familiar top hat out of stone and uses his new club as a cane.\n\n==Trivia==\n*When a Donald Duck meet and greet was added to the [[Cretaceous Trail]] at [[DinoLand U.S.A.|DinoLand U.S.A]]. at the [[Animal Kingdom]], a drawing of Bubba was included on a bulletin board's timeline of prehistory.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nDuckTalesBubba.png\nBubba Duck 01.jpg\nBubba Duck 02.jpg\nBubba Duck 03.jpg\nBubba Duck 04.PNG\nBubba Duck 05.jpg\nBubba Duck.jpg\nbubba.jpg\nBubbaWithTootsie.jpg\nBubba Duck 06.jpg\nBubba Duck 07.png|Bubba's cameo in \"[[Dangerous Currency]]\"\nBubba Duck 08.jpg\nDuckTales Remastered -Bubba.jpg\nBubba01.jpg\nbubba02.jpg\nbubba03.jpg\nbubba04.jpg\nbubba05.jpg\nBubba06.jpg\nBubba07.jpg\nTootsieBubbaDanceKids.png\nScrooge-Bubba01.jpg\nScrooge-Bubba02.jpg\nScrooge-Bubba03.jpg\nScrooge-Bubba04.jpg\nScrooge-Bubba05.jpg\nBubbaTrubba-432.png\nScrooge-Bubba06.jpg\nEp75 2.jpg\nDzhulli.jpg\nBubba tootsie.png|Bubba riding [[Tootsie the Triceratops]]\nWayToGo.jpg\nLightPole.jpg\nBubbaMissUS.jpg\nBrightIdea.jpg\nDontWorrySon.jpg\nAtopLizard.jpg\nBubbaClubba.jpg\nThermodynamics.jpg\nMaybe.jpg\nep70 A07.jpg\n3CheersBubba.jpg\nWebby supporting Bubba.jpg\nTad Stones' pitch drawing of Bubba.JPG|[[Tad Stones]]' pitch drawing of Bubba.\nDucktales 2017 Season 2 Promo Poster.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{DuckTales}}\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:DuckTales characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Time travelers]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Orphans]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric animals]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]"
