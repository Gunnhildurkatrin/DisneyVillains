Gladys is known to help thousands of people through her syndicated TV and radio shows.\n\n==Role in the series==\nDr. Okra was about to appear as a public speaker until her clumsy servant carrying drinking water accidentally bumped into her. The water bottle on the tray spilled onto the stage, leaked out, and activated Experiment 319 ([[Spike (Lilo & Stitch)|Spike]]), who then spiked both her and her servant, causing them to act goofy. Spike later attacked the entire audience.\n\n[[Pleakley]] watched Okra on television, studying the methods of \"hugging, crying, and throwing chairs\" for people who deal with their emotional problems. He wanted to do his own seminar to rehabilitate Spike, along with [[Fibber]], [[Nosy]], [[Slushy]], [[Splodyhead]], [[Bonnie (Lilo & Stitch)|Bonnie]]\u00a0and [[Clyde (Lilo & Stitch)|Clyde]]. Pleakley used the \"hugging-and-crying\" method to rehabilitate Spike, which worked, causing the other experiments to do it as well.\n\nGiven Spike's ability is temporary, Okra and her servant reverted back to normal within 48 hours.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Dr. Okra bears a striking resemblance to [[Oprah Winfrey]]. Notably, they are both media proprietors who help people through their syndicated TV shows.\n*She is revealed to be the best selling author of\u00a0''I'm Peachy, You're Peachy''.\n*Okra was Spike's first victim. Ironically, Pleakley used her methods to rehabilitate him.\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Okra, Dr. Gladys}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]\n[[Category:Authors]]\n[[Category:Television hosts]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
