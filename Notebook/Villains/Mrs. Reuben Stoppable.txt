"[[File:Start-stop.JPG|thumb|250px]]\n'''Mrs. Reuben Stoppable''', n\u00e9e '''Starter''', is a character from the [[Disney Channel]] series ''[[Kim Possible]]''. She is the new bride of\u00a0[[Reuben Stoppable]], one of\u00a0[[Ron Stoppable]]'s cousins. She is voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]].\n\n==Relationships==\n===Family===\nRon Stoppable was never seen interacting with her directly, but it can be assumed that he would have been very upset to learn that while she was aware of his being seated at the kids' table with his cousin Shaun, she did nothing to prevent this.\n\nLittle was known about her relationship with Reuben, other than he cared enough to pull her out of the way of evil Ron's plasma catapult, and that he married her.\n\n===Enemies===\nLike most brides, she would have no great love for anyone who would dare disrupt her wedding reception. In the case of the first attempt as the reception, that would clearly be Evil Ron.\n\n==Paraphernalia==\n===Clothes===\nMrs. Reuben Stoppable was only seen wearing her wedding dress with white flowers in her hair.\n\n{{Kim Possible}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stoppable, Reuben}}\n[[Category:Kim Possible characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
