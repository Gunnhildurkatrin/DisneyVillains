It was a character\u00a0in Disney's 1940 film ''[[Fantasia]] ''appearing in ''[[The Rite of Spring]]''\u00a0segment.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Fantasia]]''===\nThe Diplodocus is first seen in the film eating with the other herbivorous dinosaurs. When [[Tyrannosaurus rex]] appeared on the scene, like the other dinosaurs, it panics and runs away. After [[Stegosaurus]] is defeated, Diplodocus leaves the valley with the other Dinosaurs. Later, it is seen struggling to find food and water. Its final appearance is when it gets stuck in a tar pit and dies of heat exhaustion.\n\n===''[[The Good Dinosaur]]''===\nTwo Diplodocus were seen only at the beginning of the movie. They, along with three [[Parasaurolophus]], witness a meteor supposed to cause the extinction of dinosaurs to pass by the Earth as they continue grazing.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nA mother Diplodocus and her babies.jpg|A mother Diplodocus with her 5 babies.\n2_diplodochi_che_bevono.jpg\nfant7.jpg\nThe Good Dinosaur 02.png|3 Parasaurolophus along with 2 Diplodocuses in The Good Dinosaur\ndownload (18).jpeg|A group of Dinosaurs with Goofy's face.

Thus, it did not coexist with [[Triceratops]], [[Parasaurolophus]], or [[Tyrannosaurus rex]], all of which lived in the Campanian-Maastrichtian of the Cretaceous Period 80-66 million-years-ago.\n\n{{Fantasia}}\n[[Category:Dinosaurs]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Fantasmic characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Fantasia characters]]\n[[Category:One of Our Dinosaurs is Missing]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:The Good Dinosaur characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse (TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Pixar characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric characters]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric animals]]"
