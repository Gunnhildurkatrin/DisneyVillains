'''Experiment 022''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[ Jumba Jookiba]]\u00a0and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]]. He is designed to restrain and immobilize the target's movement with projectile donuts. First he asks, \"Ever had a Hertz Donut?\" He then fires energy which solidifies into a donut that constricts around the target, and says, \"Hurts, don't it?\" He appears in ''[[Stitch!]]''.\n\n==Background==\nExperiment 022 was the 22nd genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was\u00a0designed to shoot donuts from his mouth that can restrain movements. 022 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nHertz Donut is a green seahorse-like experiment with bright purple eyes, a donut-like mouth, six ears, and a long curling antenna winding behind his head.\n\n===Special Abilities===\nHertz Donut can confine and restrict movement by firing donuts at a target. He has the ability to speak fluently and hops instead of walks.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Stitch!]]''===\n[[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]] gained possession of Hertz Donut under unknown circumstances and modified him to wreak havoc on his behalf. In the episode \"Dorkifier\", H\u00e4msterviel intended to send Hertz Donut to capture [[Stitch]] but accidentally sent the pod for [[Dorkifier]] instead. After realizing his mistake, H\u00e4msterviel finally sends Hertz Donut after [[Yuna Kamihara|Yuna]] and Stitch, who were already dealing with Dorkifier at the school. Hertz Donut only added to the chaos during a soccer match, but Stitch is able to defeat him. In \"Shogun\", it is shown that Hertz Donut was dehydrated back into an experiment pod and locked in [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]]'s vault.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Hertz Donut is one of the rare experiments to not have black eyes like most experiments, having bright purple eyes instead.\n*Hertz Donut is one of the few known experiments that can speak fluently.\n*Hertz Donut's\u00a0[[Experiment Pods|pod]] color is red.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nHertz Donut Pod.jpg|Hertz Donut's experiment pod\nscreenCapture 14.05.13 14-54-01.jpg|\u8a66\u4f5c\u54c1022\u53f7 \u30d8\u30eb\u30c4\u30c9\u30fc\u30ca\u30c4 translates to Prototype 022 Hertz Donut\nscreenCapture 14.05.13 14-54-34.jpg\nscreenCapture 14.05.13 14-55-12.jpg\nscreenCapture 14.05.13 14-55-58.jpg\nscreenCapture 14.05.13 14-57-00.jpg\nscreenCapture 14.05.13 14-57-43.jpg\nscreenCapture 14.05.13 14-58-23.jpg\nscreenCapture 14.05.13 15-00-31.jpg\nscreenCapture 14.05.13 15-26-00.jpg\nscreenCapture 14.05.13 15-29-41.jpg\nscreenCapture 14.05.13 15-29-54.jpg\nscreenCapture 14.05.13 15-30-12.jpg\nscreenCapture 14.05.13 15-30-30.jpg\nscreenCapture 14.05.13 15-31-03.jpg\nscreenCapture 14.05.13 15-31-21.jpg\nscreenCapture 14.05.13 15-31-40.jpg\nscreenCapture 14.05.13 15-31-56.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
