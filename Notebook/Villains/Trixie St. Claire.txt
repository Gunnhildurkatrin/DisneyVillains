There is nary a sourdough or grubstaker who doesn\u2019t recall her singing and dancing in the rip-roaring music halls of the western frontier. She has been known variously as The Calgary Charmer, Alaska Allurer, Vancouver Vamp, Bewitcher of British Columbia, and Tacoma Temptress. As did so many folks with good sense, she visited Florida and decided to stay. She is now known as The Tampa Temptation. She spends her spare hours thumbing through the pages of her scrapbook and is planning to write a book, \"I Bearly Remember\".''\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nTrixie_Concept_Art.png|Concept art for Trixie by [[Marc Davis]].\nTrixie_Original_WDW.png|Trixie pre-2012 refurbishment.
