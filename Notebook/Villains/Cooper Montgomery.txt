Cooper has not made an appearance outside of season one, although he is mentioned and it's assumed they still hang out. Cooper often plays the straight man to Jackson's antics. He works at a movie theater called \"Nick's Fat City.\" He enjoys Shirley Temple cocktails, calling them \"fruity and refreshing.\" He also has a secret love of baking; something he keeps secret because he believes it is a primarily female activity.\n\nCooper has a little sister named Olivia (Rae'Ven Larrymore Kelly) who is a student on the East Coast. In \"I Can't Make You Love Hannah if You Don't,\" Olivia visits Malibu on break where she meets Jackson. She agrees to go out with Jackson before he learns she is Cooper's sister. The incident causes a temporary rift in Jackson and Cooper's friendship. They are good friends again after Cooper realizes that everything was Olivia's fault.\n\n<span style=\"font-family:sans-serif;line-height:19px;\">Cooper appears in \"Miley Get Your Gum\", \"She's a Supersneak\", \"I Can't Make You Love Hannah If You Don't\", \"It's a Mannequin's World\", \"Oops I Meddled Again\", and \"Money for Nothing, Guilt for Free\".
