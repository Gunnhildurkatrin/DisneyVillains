He is voiced by [[Katie Leigh]].\n\n==Background==\nHonker Muddlefoot, or Herbert \"Honker\" Muddlefoot Jr., is a shy, brainy, goose, and [[Gosalyn Mallard|Gosalyn]]'s best friend. Honker is the younger son of [[Herb and Binkie Muddlefoot]], and his older brother is [[Tank Muddlefoot|Tank]]. Honker is neighbors with [[Darkwing Duck (character)|Drake Mallard/Darkwing Duck]]\u00a0and is school mates with Gosalyn. It is strongly implied that Honker either figured out or somehow discovered that Drake Mallard is Darkwing Duck off-screen, but how he met the Mallard family is never shown in the series. Due to Gosalyn's involvement, Honker often helps [[Darkwing Duck]] and [[Launchpad McQuack]] in solving difficult cases.\n\n==Appearances==\n===TV Show===\nHonker's primary outfit consists of a pair of red-rimmed glasses, a green shirt, and often wearing a backpack.\n\n===Comic Series===\n==Other Depictions==\n*Occasionally, when Gosalyn becomes the costumed crimefighter Quiverwing Quack, Honker becomes her costumed sidekick \"The Arrow Kid.\"\n*In the [[Negaverse]], he is a violent juvenile delinquent and often carries a destructive weapon. He is shown wearing a hat, black leather jacket, and chains, a similar costume to Marlon Brando's in ''The Wild One''.\n*In the Darkwing Duck episode, \"[[When Aliens Collide]]\", he was once called \"Gosalyn's irritating boyfriend\" by an alien criminal named Wacko.\n*On the planet Fezanchane, Honker is called \"The Invincible One\" due to his defeat of their former leader Flarg in ''[[Battle of the Brainteasers]]''.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Honker is the only family member who is aware that his sibling, Tank, is a bully.\n*Honker returns in the comics, despite not appearing on the show anymore after \"[[Steerminator]]\".\n*Honker is the only Muddlefoot Darkwing doesn't mind as he is the smartest member of his family and doesn't annoy him as much as Herb or Binkie.\n*It is unknown how he met Drake Mallard, Launchpad McQuack and Gosalyn. Or how he found out that Drake Mallard is Darkwing Duck. \n\n==Honker's international voice actors==\n* USA: [[Katie Leigh]]\n* Japan: Ai Orikasa\n* Poland: Joanna Wizmur\n* Germany: Sabine Bohlmann\n* Italy: Ilaria Stagni\n*Netherlands: Maura Renardel de Lavalette\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n{{Darkwing Duck}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Muddlefoot, Honker}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Darkwing Duck characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Geese]]\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]"
