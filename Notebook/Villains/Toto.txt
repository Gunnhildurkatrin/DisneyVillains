Frank Baum}}\n'''Toto''' is [[Dorothy Gale]]'s pet dog in ''[[Return to Oz]]''. He is based on the one of the same name in the book ''{{WikipediaLink|The Wonderful Wizard of Oz}}''.\n\n==''[[Return to Oz]]''==\nIn ''Return to Oz'', Toto was with Dorothy on her first trip to [[Land of Oz|Oz]], but when she's taken to the hospital, he barks at her as though he knows something is going to happen.\n\nIn the end, he manages to track her down after [[Princess Ozma|Ozma]] uses the [[Ruby Slippers|ruby slippers]] to send her home to [[Kansas]]. After witnessing Ozma in Dorothy's mirror, he joins her to go outside and play.\n\n==''[[Timon & Pumbaa]]''==\nToto makes a cameo appearance with Dorothy in the episode \"[[Broadway Bound & Gagged]]\".\n\n==Appearances in other media==\n===''[[The Muppets' Wizard of Oz]]''===\n[[File:Totoreal.jpg|left|thumb]]In ''The Muppets' Wizard of Oz'', instead of being a dog, Toto is a king prawn, rescued from [[Aunt Em's Diner]] by [[Dorothy Gale (The Muppets' Wizard of Oz)|Dorothy]] since [[Aunt Em (Muppets Wizard of Oz)|Aunt Em]] won't allow her to have a dog. He is one of her few friends in [[Kansas]], and she rushes back into the trailer to rescue him during the tornado.\n\nOnce transported to Oz, however, Toto, having broken out of his tank, has enlarged, is nude, and speaks with a Spanish accent. Dorothy supplies him with costuming, and he (portrayed by [[Pepe the King Prawn]]) tries to become her agent in return.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Toto is made to look like Dorothy's pet but doesn't get any more screen time until very late in ''Return to Oz''. Her real one turns out to be [[Billina]] in the long run. \n\n==Other portrayals==\n*[[w:c:muppets:Foo-Foo|Foo-Foo]] took on a more traditional portrayal of Toto in ''The Muppets Go to the Movies'' and \"The Wizard of Foz,\" a comic from ''Muppet Magazine'' issue 4.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Perry the Platypus]] (portrayed Toto in \"[[Wizard of Odd]]\")\n*[[Pluto]] (portrayed Toto in \"[[The Wizard of Dizz]]\")\n\n{{Oz}}\n{{Once Upon a Time}}\n[[Category:Oz characters]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Return to Oz characters]]\n[[Category:The Muppets' Wizard of Oz characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Once Upon a Time characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Timon & Pumbaa characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]"
