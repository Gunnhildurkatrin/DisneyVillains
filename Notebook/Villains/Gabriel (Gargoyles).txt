"[[File:Gabriel2.jpg|thumb|250px]]'''Gabriel''' is a minor character from [[Disney Television Animation|Disney]]'s ''[[Gargoyles]]''. He is a [[Gargoyle (creature)|gargoyle]] living on [[Avalon]], and is the leader of the [[Avalon Clan]]. He is voiced by Ruben Santiago-Hudson.\n\n==Role in the series==\nWhen [[Hakon]] and the Vikings attacked, Gabriel was still an unhatched egg in the rookery at [[Castle Wyvern]]. [[Princess Katharine]], the [[Magus]], and [[Tom]] took the eggs to Avalon in 995 while fleeing Constantine III. Gabriel, like his rookery siblings, lived peacefully on Avalon until 1995 when the [[Archmage]] and his forces attacked. Tom later returned with [[Goliath]], [[Elisa Maza|Elisa]], and [[Bronx]], and Gabriel assisted them in the defeat of the Archmage, [[Demona]], [[Macbeth]], and the [[Weird Sisters]].\n\nSome time later, Lord [[Oberon]] and Queen [[Titania]] returned to reclaim Avalon, trying to evict the [[Avalon Clan]]. Oberon prepared to destroy them, but at Titania's behest, he agreed to do battle with Goliath, [[Angela]], and Gabriel at the reduced strength of one of his Children. While the heroes of Avalon fought Oberon across the isle, Tom, Elisa, and other members of the Avalon clan created a weapon against Oberon, using Titania's clues - an iron bell.\n\nGabriel, Goliath, and Angela were defeated, but the remainder of the clan used the bell nearly to destroy Oberon. When Tom stopped just short of killing him, Oberon was impressed enough to make the Avalon clan his \"Honor Guard of Avalon.\"\n\nWhen Angela met [[Coldstone]], she claimed that Gabriel was his biological son, but Coldstone dismissed it.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nGabrielYoung.jpg|Young Gabriel\nAvalonClan2.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.gargwiki.net/Gabriel Gabriel] at GargWiki\n\n{{Gargoyles}}\n[[Category:Gargoyles characters]]\n[[Category:Gargoyles]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
