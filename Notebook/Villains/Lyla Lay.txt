She was also featured in Pikappa and [[PKNE]].\n\n==Background==\nLyla is a journalist of Channel 00, but that job is just a front. Actually, Lyla is an agent of the Time Police, an organization from the future with agents in several key periods to avert history from being manipulated by time travelers.\n\n==History==\nOrigins of Lyla differ with each new retelling of the Duck Avenger story.\n\nIn '''PKNA''', Lyla first met [[The Duck Avenger]] during a soap opera party where she and [[Angus Fangus]] were invited as reporters. The Duck Avenger saved all the guests from an attack by the [[Evronians]].\n\nThe Duck Avenger found out the truth about Lyla, including the fact that she knew he was Donald, when Lyla helped him fight against [[the Raider]]. After stopping the Raider, Lyla also revealed to the Duck Avenger that she really is an android.\n\nIn '''Pikappa''', Lyla is the web-reporter of 00-channel.com, and met Duck Avenger during the Toyland incident, where she immediately saves him from being squished by a mechanical T-Rex, inadvertently breaking her own arm. Donald, puzzled by revelation that his favorite web-journalist is actually an android, takes her for repairs to his HQ.\n\nWhile in transfer, Lyla told her story: Lyonard D'Aq, while investigating his own factory, found her disabled in a pile of rubble, and repaired her as far as his abilities could do, educated her and released her; though her mnemonic files largely remained damaged. Later Lyla found work as a web-reporter.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"185\">\nLylaLay.jpg\nLyla armor.jpg|Lyla in her Time Police armor\nLyla swimsuit.jpg\nPkna 12 geena dies.jpg|Lyla witnesses [[Geena]]'s death.\nRc8xv6.png\n846538-fi tk2000 05c 001 lyla.jpg\nLates.jpg\nLat.jpg\nLae.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lay, Lyla}}\n\n{{PKNA}}\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
