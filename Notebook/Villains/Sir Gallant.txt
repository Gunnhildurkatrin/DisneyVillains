He appears in the episode \"[[A Knight to Remember (Adventures of the Gummi Bears)|A Knight to Remember]]\".\n\n==Background==\nSir Gallant was an elderly [[Gummi Bears|Gummi]] knight who was ordered by the Great Gummies to dismantle the [[Doomsday Clock]], a device created by [[Zorlock and Grot|Zorlock]] that could cause total destruction.\n\nHowever, he passed away before his quest was complete, and would not be allowed to rest until his spirit could aid a living Gummi knight to continue the quest.\n\nOne day [[Cubbi Gummi|Cubbi]] comes across his tombstone. As Cubbi had previously been commissioned an official Gummi knight in \"[[The Knights of Gummadoon]]\", Sir Gallant's spirit is released, with only Cubbi bring able to see the ghost.\n\nCubbi is aided by an amulet, given to Gallant by the Great Gummies, which serves as a compass that glows brighter the closer they get to the Doomsday Clock.\n\nAlong their journey, Cubbi is also taught important lessons of knighthood by Sir Gallant, such as not using [[Gummiberry Juice]] until the point of true need, or that being a knight is not just thrill-seeking.\n\nCubbi helps Sir Gallant in his quest, and Sir Gallant's ghost is finally able to rest, leaving Cubbi with the amulet compass as proof that their quest really happened.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=180 spacing=small position=center captionalign=center>\n\nAdventuresOfTheGummiBears-AKnightToRemember-SirGallantsHeadstone.png\nVlcsnap-2015-08-15-11h45m10s769.png\nAdventuresOfTheGummiBears-AKnightToRemember-SirGallentInGummiGlen01.png\nAdventuresOfTheGummiBears-AKnightToRemember-SirGallentInGummiGlen02.png\nAdventuresOfTheGummiBears-AKnightToRemember-SirGallentInGummiGlen03.png\ng1107.jpg\nAdventuresOfTheGummiBears-AKnightToRemember-ClimbingMountains.png\ng1115.jpg\nGallent hands wrench.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Adventures of the Gummi Bears}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gallent}}\n[[Category:Adventures of the Gummi Bears characters]]\n[[Category:Bears]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Knights]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Spirits]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Gummi bears]]"
