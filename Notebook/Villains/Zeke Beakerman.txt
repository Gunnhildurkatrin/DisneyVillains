Zeke is considered \"cool\", yet nerdy. He attends Tribeca Prep and is in advanced chemistry along with Justin. He is also part of an \"alien language\" club; he and Justin often speak \"alien\" to each other. Dan Benson, however, first appeared in \"Movies,\" where his character's name was Zack Rosenblatt, but he was later re-cast as Zeke Beakerman.\n\n==Background==\n===Biography===\nZeke and Justin are also on the same Quiz Bowl team in \"Smarty Pants\". Zeke and Justin have tried out for several sports teams, but have apparently failed at all of them (including cross country and tennis), except Justin in the basketball team, and Zeke in cheerleading.\n\nIn \"Fashion Week\", they succeeded at talking to models, by playing their \"nerd game\". Zeke got the role of Peter Pan in Justin's school play in \"Fairy Tale.\" In the episode \"Wizard For A Day\", he is upset when he realizes the real aliens do not understand his \"alien speak\". Zeke and Harper go to \"Zombie Prom\" together. As of Season 3, Zeke has been featured in episodes more often. In \"Alex Saves Mason\", he came close to finding out the Russo's secret, after witnessing Mason transform from a wolf to an in-between stage of human and wolf. In season 4, Zeke eventually finds out the Russo's are wizards.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n====Season 1====\n*Movies (credited as Zack Rosenblatt)\n*Report Card (credited as Friend #1)\n\n====Season 2====\n*Smarty Pants\n*Racing\n*Alex's Brother, Maximan\n*Baby Cupid\n*Fairy Tale\n*Fashion Week\n*Paint By Committee\n*Wizard For A Day\n*Wizards & Vampires vs. Zombies\n====Season 3====\n*Marathoner Helper\n*Positive Alex\n*Detention Election\n*Third Wheel\n*Dad's Buggin' Out\n*Alex Russo, Matchmaker?\n*Delinquent Justin\n*Wizards vs. Finkles\n*All About You-niverse\n*Wizards Unleashed\n*Wizards Exposed\n====Season 4====\n*Daddy's Little Girl\n*Zeke Finds Out\n*Magic Unmasked\n*Wizards vs. Asteroid\n*Alex the Puppetmaster\n*My Two Harpers\n*Ghost Roommate\n*Harperella\n*Who Will Be The Family Wizard\nTotal of 31 Episodes\n\n==Relationship==\n===Harper Finkle===\nZeke has shown interest in Harper, but the two have gone on a date at Alex's Zombie Prom. Zeke accepted when Harper asked him immediately, and appeared to enjoy himself with her, often complimenting her. In \"Alex Russo, Matchmaker?\", Alex convinces Zeke to ask Harper to be his science fair partner after Justin decided he wanted to be alone in the science fair this year. He said that he's always wanted to talk to Harper, and they both have a crush on each other. In Wizards Unleashed, they have their first kiss. It also stated in season 4 \"Zeke Finds Out\" he found out that the Russo's are wizards and fainted, but he was very excited about his best friend being a wizard.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Beakerman, Zeke}}\n\n{{Wizards of Waverly Place}}\n[[Category:Wizards of Waverly Place Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Cheerleaders]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
