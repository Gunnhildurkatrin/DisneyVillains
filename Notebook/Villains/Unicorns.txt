They are part of the cast in \"[[The Pastoral Symphony]]\" segment of the [[1940]] film ''[[Fantasia]]''.\n\n==Background==\nThe unicorns inhabit Olympus along with the other mythological creatures. They are somewhat close to classical representations of unicorns, having hairy fetlocks, spiraled horns, a \"lion\" tail, and cloven hooves. Unlike the [[Pegasi Siblings|Pegasi]], they don't seem to exhibit a lot of variety in colors, as they're only shown as white with pink manes or blue or pink with white manes. They all have golden horns, however. With the centaurs, they seem to get along well, to the point that a centaurette took it upon herself to rescue a stranded unicorn in the middle of the storm. \n\nThe unicorns are shown to be rather brave despite their appearance and will protect each other at all costs. A pink adult, for instance, was shown braving the storm's strong winds while three foals were hiding under it. \n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Fantasia]] ''===\nThe unicorns make their debut frolicking in the flower fields and open-air temples of ancient [[Greece]] along with their friends, the [[Satyrs (Fantasia)|satyrs]], playing and generally having a good time. They also engage in [[Bacchus (Fantasia)|Bacchus]]' celebration along with the satyrs, [[Centaurs (Fantasia)|centaurs]], and [[Centaurettes|centaurettes]], enjoying the dancing and winemaking. \n\nSoon, their fun is spoiled when [[Zeus (Fantasia)|Zeus]] decides to create a thunderstorm with powerful winds and heavy rain, forcing them (along with the rest of the surface dwellers) to take refuge inside temples, groves, and hedges before he can unleash his thunderbolts. When he tires of tormenting them and goes back to sleep they celebrate the storm's end along with the other creatures and enjoy watching [[Iris (goddess)|Iris]] casting a rainbow over the sky with her cape, [[Apollo (Fantasia)|Apollo]] racing away on his sun chariot and waving goodbye to them as the sun sets, and tucking themselves in as [[Morpheus (Fantasia)|Morpheus]] casts her cloak of night over the land. By the time [[Diana]] shoots her arrow into the sky and fills it with stars, they are sound asleep, as is everyone else.\n\n===''[[Once Upon a Time]] ''===\nIn ''Once Upon a Time'', [[Maleficent]] owned a black pet unicorn. She and [[The Evil Queen|Regina]] duel over the Dark Curse and when Regina tries to kill Maleficent's unicorn, Maleficent shields it with her [[Maleficent's Staff|staff]], protecting it, but losing the Dark Curse in the process.\n\nAfter [[Snow White]] and [[The Prince|Prince Charming]] learn of their [[Emma Swan|unborn child]]'s potential for great darkness, they learn that if they touch a unicorn's horn, they can glimpse what their child will be like in the future. When Charming touches it, he sees a young baby in the forest but when Snow touches it, she sees her teenage daughter rip her [[heart]] out and crush it.\n\n===''[[Onward]]''===\nWinged unicorns appeared as feral animals in New Mushroomton as common pests eating rubbish from waste containers in the everyday neighborhood and also make donkey noises with background roles. They are also portrayed as acting hostile towards anyone who attempts to clean up the mess they did. Three of them also appeared in the climax of the film where Ian and Barley proceed to a gauntlet in the Raven's Point area to find the [[Phoenix Gem]] to which the two pass through them.\n\n===''[[Gravity Falls]]''===\nUnicorns have been featured in the Season 2 episode, ''[[The Last Mabelcorn]]''. They inhabit a mystical home where the last of her kind [[Celestabellebethabelle]] examines [[Mabel Pines|Mabel]]'s heart to which she found out that she has no pure heart to which in order to prover herself, she must do at least a thousand of good deeds. Despite doing this, Celestabellebethabelle tells her she still has no pure heart. Just then, Mabel sneaks up in her and obtains a piece of her hair, causing the unicorn talking to her to summon two additional male unicorns in revenge just as Mabel attacks the males' leader, causing the girls and the unicorns to clash against each other.\n\nFortunately, the girls manage to survive the battle with the unicorns to get the objects to shield [[the Mystery Shack]] to protect it from [[Bill Cipher]]'s evil forces.\n\n===''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]''===\n[[Peter Pevensie]] uses a unicorn for transportation in the [[2005]] Disney/[[Walden Media]] adaptation of ''The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe''.\n\nThe unicorn is first seen during a training sequence where Peter rides on it and trains with his brother [[Edmund Pevensie|Edmund]] upon arriving at Aslan's Camp.\n\nThe unicorn later appears during the battle against [[Jadis the White Witch|Jadis]] at Beruna, which fights with Aslan's army to which upon noticing Jadis' army charging by, a flock of gryphons and eagles are summoned to drop boulders at the incoming army, killing a couple of minions part of Jadis' army. As the dwarves begin firing arrows at the gryphons and eagles in revenge, Peter, riding on his unicorn, sees the other members of Jadis's army getting closer, so he leads the other Narnians to charge and fight back. Peter's unicorn then charges across the battlefield with the other members of Aslan's army to which both armies clash violently at Beruna.\n\nIn the extended version of the film, Peter, riding on his unicorn, notices a harpy preparing to kill a phoenix summoned by one of the archers to which Peter grabs a spear from a dead cyclops and throws it at the harpy. Upon killing the harpy, Peter (still on his unicorn) notices a goblin preparing to kill the phoenix using a bow and arrow to which Peter managed to protect the phoenix and prevent the attack from happening by killing the goblin, just as Peter watches the phoenix resume flying towards the ground to successfully create a fire barrier as the other Narnians cheer for a success. Later during battle, Peter's unicorn gets struck by [[Ginarrbrik]] with an arrow, injuring the unicorn and its rider in progress. The unicorn, however, is shown to have survived upon Peter noticing a rhinoceros preparing to charge against the White Witch.\n\n===''[[Yin Yang Yo!]]''===\n\n===''[[Star vs. the Forces of Evil]]''===\nIn [[Mewni]],\n\n===''[[Sofia the First]]''===\n'''Unicorns''' here on Sofia the First are can only be found at the Mystic Isles.\n\n===''[[American Dragon: Jake Long]]''===\n\n===''[[The Owl House]]''===\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\">\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-8081.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps 23.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-8101.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-8101 (1).jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-8126.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps 24.jpg\nTumblr nubhg4vpKS1r3jmn6o1 1280.png\nOnce Upon a Time - 1x02 - The Thing You Love Most - Maleficent.jpg|[[Maleficent]] with her unicorn in ''[[Once Upon a Time]]''\n416Unicorn.png\nStar is Riding on a Wild Unicorn.png\nUnicorn in Onward teaser.png\nFile:DSA-Unicorn.png|a model for a Unicorn (Onward) In [[Disney Sorcerer's Arena]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*[[Jacchus]] is a parody of the pretty pastel unicorns; he's a rather unattractive donkey whose only indication of being anywhere close to them is the long yellow horn growing out of his head.\n*One of the unicorns makes a cameo appearance during the final scene of the film, ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' among the crowd of [[toons]].\n\n==External links==\n\n*[[w:c:non-aliencreatures:Unicorn|Unicorn at Non-Alien Creatures Wiki]]\n*{{WP|Unicorn}}\n\n{{Fantasia}}\n{{Once Upon a Time}}\n{{DuckTales}}\n{{Onward}}\n{{Star vs. the Forces of Evil}}\n{{The Chronicles of Narnia}}\n[[Category:Fantasia characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Once Upon a Time characters]]\n[[Category:Unicorns]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Who Framed Roger Rabbit cameos]]\n[[Category:Mystical animals]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]\n[[Category:Pixar characters]]\n[[Category:Onward characters]]\n[[Category:American Dragon: Jake Long characters]]\n[[Category:Gravity Falls characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:DuckTales characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:The Owl House characters]]\n[[Category:Sofia the First characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Yin Yang Yo! characters]]\n[[Category:Star vs. the Forces of Evil characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:The Chronicles of Narnia characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Sorcerer's Arena Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Magic Kingdoms characters]]"
