'''Experiment 113''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]].\u00a0He is designed to generate negative events; however, adjusting his cranial horseshoe controls the type of event (luck) generated. In a downward position, he causes bad luck; in an upright position, he causes good luck. His one true place is at the most difficult mini-golf course, making miniature golfers score holes-in-one.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nShoe appears to be mute, but also friendly and sociable as seen when he tried to make friends with [[Stitch]]. Unlike most experiments, Shoe doesn't mean to cause chaos intentionally; it's just the way he was programmed. He is also shown to be very sensitive about his bad luck powers, as seen when he overheard [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] say that he cannot seem to change his bad luck and is apparently useless. He felt abandoned and hurt after hearing these words and even ran away. However, when Lilo learned that Shoe could generate good luck, she apologized to him after finding him, and he seemed to forgive Lilo when he hugged her.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nShoe is a green, lanky experiment with a horseshoe-shaped head, a pointed face with black eyes, small dark purple round nose, and two long curved horns with white tips that are shaped like a horseshoe. The horns can be flipped upward or downward.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nShoe is a luck-manipulating experiment. When his cranial horseshoe, or the \"horns\" on his head, are facing down, bad luck occurs; when the horseshoe is turned up, good luck occurs. The events can be predicted to happen whenever the tips of his horns glow, and also a faint bleep is heard. Shoe cannot control the luck his powers provide to himself or others, however, and is dependent on the horns' position.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment 113 was the 113th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to generate bad luck, but could also cause good luck.\u00a0113 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai, with 113's pod landing on a miniature golf course.\n\n113's pod was used as a golf ball, where a miniature golfer whacked it. The pod landed in the moat obstacle, activating 113, who then went around the island causing bad luck.\n\n[[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] had been informed about 113, but\u00a0[[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]] refused to have a bad luck experiment. Gantu then had a squabble with [[Reuben|Experiment 625]], who tried to tell the former about 113's good luck abilities. When Reuben later managed to reveal this to Gantu (and even\u00a0tape-recorded his earlier protests), the latter decided to track down and capture 113.\n\nMeanwhile, 113, named Shoe, traveled to the [[Lilo's House|Pelekai residence]], where his bad luck caused [[Nani Pelekai|Nani]]'s jeep to break down, thus forcing her to walk to work. He was later caught raiding the kitchen by [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] and [[Pleakley]].\u00a0Shoe kept generating bad luck for Lilo's ''[[Pelekai \u02bbohana|\u02bbohana]]'', despite their best efforts to change his bad luck effects and hide him someplace where the bad luck he created could not affect them.\n\nEventually, Lilo began to admit that it was impossible for Shoe to change his luck, but Shoe unfortunately overheard Lilo and promptly left, feeling hurt and abandoned. After Jumba revealed that Shoe could generate good luck, Lilo and Stitch set out to find him. Shoe was sitting alone on a cliff when they discovered him, but before they could save him, Gantu overtook Stitch and scooped Shoe in a container. Despite being captured, Shoe's bad luck allowed him to evade both Gantu and Stitch.\n\nAfter a series of mishaps, Gantu managed to reclaim Shoe and turned the latter's horns upward, causing him to generate good luck for Gantu. Shoe was then left alone on [[Lahui Beach|the beach]]\u00a0after his good luck caused Gantu to become rich, making the experiment feel just as useless as when he generated bad luck.\n\nShoe was eventually found by Lilo, who apologized to\u00a0the former\u00a0for giving up on him. After generating good luck for Lilo's ''\u02bbohana'' and bad luck for Gantu, Shoe was found his one true place at a mini-golf course (the same one where he was activated) using his \"good luck setting\" to allow golfers to score holes-in-one.\n\nIn \"[[Skip (episode)|Skip]]\", Shoe was one of the wanted fugitives who had already been captured in an alternate future where H\u00e4msterviel ruled Earth.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nThe first 624 experiments, including Shoe, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium\u00a0to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], Pleakley, [[Reuben]] and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nShoe participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]], but it is unknown what he did.\n\nThe Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Lilo stated that she didn't name 113 \"Shoe\" because of his horseshoe-like horn,\u00a0but because she thinks he needs shoes, despite the fact that none of the experiments wear shoes.\n*According to Jumba, the moment he created Shoe, [[Jumba's Lab|his laboratory]] exploded.\n*Altering the position of Shoe's U-shaped horn in order to reverse his powers is the same way to reverse the effects of [[Dorkifier]]. Also, the closeness of their numbers (113 and\u00a0122) and movable horn feature may suggest that Jumba had been inspired by the same DNA source when creating both. This would be a similar concept to how Jumba reused some for Twang's DNA when creating [[Bragg]].\n*Shoe's [[Experiment Pods|pod]] color is purple.\n*The [[Experiment Pod Container]] describes Shoe as: \"Experiment 113. Primary function: Negative event generator.\"\n*His number is a likely reference to the number 13, which is considered unlucky by most Western cultures.\n*Shoe's holographic silhouette appeared in \"[[Snooty (episode)|Snooty]]\".\n**Shoe is shown to have two different graphic designs on [[Jumba's Computer|Jumba's computer]].\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
