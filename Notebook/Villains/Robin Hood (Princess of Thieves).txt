He is Maid Marian's husband and [[Gwyn]]'s father.\n\n==Role in the film==\nAfter his wife, Maid Marian, dies giving birth to their daughter, [[Gwyn]], Robin Hood is perpetually away battling in the Crusades with King Richard, therefore, Gwyn has lived much of her life alone. As the years pass, she grows up to be a strong-willed young peasant woman with a talent for archery, much like her father.\n\nOne day, Robin Hood is first seen arriving back from the Crusades to England by horse cart as his friend, Will Scarlet sends a carrier pigeon to inform Gwyn of his return after five years of absence.\n\nAt night, having arrived with Will Scarlet late, Robin hears his daughter complaining about how sad she is after five years of not seeing him and the promises he makes (and probably never keeps) unlike the sadness her friend, Froderick had to endure when he lost his parents he never knew. Just then, he reveals himself to Gwyn, having arrived with his friend, amazed to see how beautiful she has grown; her beauty reminding him of her late mother. Happy to see her father again, Gwyn embraces him in her arms as she welcomes him back home. Then, Robin proceeds to greet everyone else including his old friend, Friar Tuck.\n\nThe next day, Robin is packing his things with Will again until Will suggests he spends some time with her before leaving tomorrow but he seems more concerned about the dying King Richard's kingdom falling into the hands of his greedy brother, Prince John. Having heard the whole thing, Gwyn suggests to go with him, meet, and bring back King Richard's illegitimate son, Prince Philip from France, much to Will's joy, but Robin refuses as he worries for her safety and about Prince John's spies since he knows what Prince John is capable of doing to his prisoners if Gwyn were captured and he promised her mother to keep her out of harm's way. However, this event sparks up an argument between him and his daughter resulting in Gwyn having to stay home while still being treated like a child; much to Gwyn's dismay. Will, having heard the whole thing, seems disappointed but Robin simply states that putting Prince Philip on the throne would be dangerous and is no place for a girl either.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Princess of Thieves characters]]\n[[Category:English characters]]\n\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Archers]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Widows/Widowers]]"
