She is the 6-year-old daughter of [[Rebecca Cunningham]].\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nAn adventurous little girl who, even at six years old, Molly is not afraid to speak her mind, just like her mother. Molly has a thing for her favorite ice cream brand \"Frosty Pep\"; sometimes she pretends that she is \"Danger Woman\" (the action/adventure heroine of a popular kids radio program), while seeking adventure along with [[Kit Cloudkicker|Kit]] and [[Baloo#TaleSpin|Baloo]]. She also carries a doll named Lucy, and often outwits adversaries much older than her.\n\nNo mention was ever made of Molly's father. The series' creator Jymn Magon reportedly said that Rebecca is a widow, although at a [[1998]] U.S. fan convention Q&A online chat, he did state in roundabout tones that she's actually divorced, as originally written in the first ''TaleSpin'' press release. But in the comic \"The Long Flight Home\", she insinuates that her dad is deceased.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nFor the most part, Molly looks quite similar to her mother, the only difference being her golden yellow fur, and lack of lighter fur around the eyes. She wears a pink polo shirt, lavender overalls, frilly white panties, and blue hair bows around her ears during the day; a red cape and a tin strainer on her head as her alter ego \"Danger Woman\", and pink footie pajamas at bedtime.\n\n==''[[DuckTales (2017 series)|DuckTales (2017)]]''==\n[[File:The Lost Cargo of Kit Cloudkicker! (27).png|thumb|left|Molly in the reboot.]] Molly appears as a special guest in the ''DuckTales'' reboot's third season episode \"[[The Lost Cargo of Kit Cloudkicker!]]\" as an adult, alongside [[Kit Cloudkicker]]. In the series, she and Kit grew up together and went to flight school with [[Della Duck]], who considers Molly to be an ace pilot. She is now a professional daredevil pilot who owns and operates Danger Woman's Death-Defying Sky Circus.\n\nMuch like how Rebecca and Baloo met, after Kit defaulted on his payments for the [[Sea Duck]], she buys the plane from the bank and asks Kit to join her circus as a fulltime sky surfer, which he accepts.\n\nShe makes a brief cameo in \"[[The Last Adventure!]]\"; having been captured by [[F.O.W.L.]] alongside Kit and numerous other McDuck Family allies in an effort to be destroyed by their enemies. However, she is rescued in the end.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*In \"[[Mommy for a Day]]\", Molly's middle name is revealed to be Elizabeth, making Molly the only character in the show to have a middle name revealed.\n\n{{TaleSpin}}\n{{DuckTales}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cunningham, Molly}}\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TaleSpin characters]]\n[[Category:Bears]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:DuckTales characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
