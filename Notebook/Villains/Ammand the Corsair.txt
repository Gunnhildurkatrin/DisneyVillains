He is the Pirate Lord of the Black Sea, and attended the fourth Brethren Court meeting.\n\n==Background==\nAmmand was the Pirate Lord of the Black Sea. He speaks in a deep voice and despite being well-groomed, he uses an aggressive behavior to settle disagreements.\n\n===Appearance===\nAmmand has a large curled mustache wearing an embroidered headdress on his head. He also wore a gold and brown coat and breeches with a cloak arranged on his shoulders.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]''===\nIn a plan to consult the pirate lords of the [[Brethren Court]] at Shipwreck Cove to fight against [[Davy Jones]] working for [[Cutler Beckett|Lord Cutler Beckett]], Ammand and the rest of the pirate lords are present with [[Jack Sparrow]] and his crew attending under command by [[Hector Barbossa]] where all the pirate lords hand their pieces of eight to bind [[Tia Dalma|Calypso]] in a plan to fight Davy Jones under command of Lord Cutler Beckett. \n\nDuring a plan to fight against Davy Jones and free Calypso, Ammand and the other pirate lords refuse to listen and fight each other in a brawl, believing Calypso is a threat to the Brethren Court. Barbossa, however, stops the fight, clarifying that it was the First Court who imprisoned Calypso, planning to release her. Jack Sparrow takes part in a speech devising a plan to fight against the [[East India Trading Company|EITC]]'s forces while Barbossa summons [[Captain Teague]] who later arrives to deal with the plan.\n\nAs Captain Teague arrives, he shows Jack's crew and the Brethren Court the Codex to which all the pirate lords vote for themselves and as [[Elizabeth Swann|Elizabeth]] plans to fight against the EITC, Ammand and the other pirate lords accept Elizabeth's request in a plan to fight against the EITC. \n\nLater, when Elizabeth commands all the pirates to raise their flags to prepare for battle, Ammand is present with the pirate lords who also raise their flags to prepare to fight against Davy Jones and the EITC under Elizabeth's command. \n\nAfter Davy Jones falls to his death during battle at the maelstrom and Lord Cutler Beckett is defeated for good, Ammand and the other pirate lords celebrate their freedom from the EITC, alongside [[Tai Huang]] and his men and the crew of the ''[[Black Pearl]]'' in victory.\n\n==Other Appearances==\n\n===[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Battle for the Sunken Treasure]]===\nIn the opening cavern sequence of this ride, the skeletal corpses of the Brethren Court members can be seen sitting at a table, Ammand being one of them. It is unknown how they died or what they were doing on Treasure Cove which lead to their apparent deaths.\n\n==Video games==\n\n===[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (video game)|''At World's End'' (Video Game)]]===\nAmmand returns in the video game adaptation of the ''Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End'' film. Compared to the film version, Ammand's role is much more significant as he appears more often and becomes a playable character out of the story modes. In the game, Ammand helps Jack Sparrow and his crew through several missions and guides them through certain areas. At one point in the story mode, he becomes playable\n\n===''[[LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean: The Video Game]]''===\n[[File:Lego Pirates Ammand .webp|thumb|Ammand in the ''Lego Pirates of the Caribbean'' video game.]]\nAmmand returns in the Lego video game version of the ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' movies. His role remains pretty much the same as compared to the movies, but is in need of assistance when a statue of himself fails construction, and requires the help of Jack Sparrow and Barbossa. Afterwards, he attends the Brethren Court meeting after finishing he and the other pirate\u2019s quests during the level. \n\n==Trivia==\n*In the [[Joe Books]] adaptation of the ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' series, it was originally going to feature Ammand and his castle in a \"caper story\" showing the final piece of the Weather Gauge stolen from the castle's collection in the seventh issue, followed by the story taking place at Ammand's castle in the planned and eighth issue. However, after the fifth issue, the rest of the issues were cancelled.\n\n==External links==\n*[https://pirates.fandom.com/wiki/Ammand Ammand] on [https://pirates.fandom.com/wiki/ Pirates of the Caribbean Wiki].\n\n{{Pirates of the Caribbean}}\n[[Category:Pirates of the Caribbean characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
