He is a wealthy landlord who is now deceased.\n== History ==\nMenke lived in Latvia, and was the father of [[Myra Menke|Myra]]. According to [[Madame Zeroni]], he spoiled her and left her without room to make her own decisions. The latter's friend, [[Elya Yelnats]], wanted to marry Myra, and talked to Morris. However, all he had to offer was a heart full of love, to which Morris burst out laughing. He was unable to compete with a fellow suitor, Igor Barkov, who had offered his largest pig for her.\n\nTo get help, Elya went to [[Madame Zeroni]] who gave him one of her pigs and a way to make it grow larger. When the time came, the pig ended up the same size as the pig Igor offered. Elya suggested that Myra choose, and Morris agreed. Not knowing who to choose, Myra asks which pig is heavier, and Morris reveals the odds. She had to resort to number games in order to decide between Elya and Igor despite that Igor was old enough to be her father and quite crude. Disgusted, Elya decided not to marry Myra, and left his pig behind as a wedding gift. Her family laughed at him as he walked away in anger. Morris later died sometime before the birth of [[Stanley Yelnats IV]].\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Menke, Myra}}\n\n{{Holes}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Holes characters]]\n[[Category:European characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
