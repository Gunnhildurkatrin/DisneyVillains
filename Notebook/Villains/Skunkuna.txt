He is designed to launch out spheres of pink repulsive odors from underneath his fur and is susceptible to [[Mr. Stenchy]]'s charms, something that [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]]'s experiments are immune to. When his odor is mixed with Mr. Stenchy's, it can incredibly be used as an air freshener. \n\n==Background==\nSkunkuna is a genetic experiment created by [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]], and one of the only experiments to not be assigned a number. He was designed to fire off spheres of pink repulsive odors everywhere.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nSkunkuna is a black skunk-like experiment with a proboscis-like beak, some peculiar fish- and housefly-like traits, and bright purple eyes.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nSkunkuna can fire off spheres of pink repulsive odors from underneath his fur. It is also shown that when his odor is mixed with [[Mr. Stenchy]]'s, it can apparently be used as an air freshener.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Stitch!]]''===\nSkunkuna first appeared when [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]] created him under unknown circumstances. He was then sent by H\u00e4msterviel to battle [[Stitch]], who was with [[Yuna Kamihara|Yuna]] at the time. They both had breathing masks so that they wouldn't be overcome by [[Mr. Stenchy]]'s horrible smell. Unfortunately, Stitch's mask fell off at some point, leaving him open to attack. At the end of the episode, Skunkuna is seen infatuated with Mr. Stenchy, and it is revealed that a mixture of Mr. Stenchy and Skunkuna's aroma oddly enough creates an air freshener.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Skunkuna is one of the rare experiments to not have black eyes like most experiments, having bright purple eyes instead.\n*There is a misconception that this experiment is really Experiment 126 (a.k.a. Stank). This contradicts what was established in the English dub of the episode, where this experiment was created by [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]] and called Skunkuna. Since we do not have a direct translation of the [[Japan]]ese language episode it is a bit difficult to confirm whether or not this design is [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]]'s Experiment 126 or H\u00e4msterviel's Skunkuna. However, [[Jess Winfield]], who worked on the dub, explained via email with member [[User:Ronlof|Ronlof]] that \"the skunk-like experiment is Skunkuna, created by H\u00e4msterviel in the Japanese series... so he's outside of Jumba's numbering scheme.\" He also confirmed that the English team received translated scripts from Japan when \"reversioning\" the episode. Additionally, Ronlof consulted a Japanese speaker who says this experiment is referred to as \u30b9\u30ab\u30f3\u30af\u30fc\u30ca in Japan, which translates to \"Skunkuna\" which is his name in the dub. Since there is no official source referring to Skunkuna as Experiment 126 or Stank, it is most likely that what is said in the dub is, in fact, true, and this experiment, named Skunkuna, was indeed created by H\u00e4msterviel. The idea that Skunkuna is Experiment 126 appears to be fabricated by the fandom.\n*Skunkuna is shown to be gay, as he fell in love with Mr. Stenchy.\n*Skunkuna is the first known experiment to be created directly by H\u00e4msterviel, as well as the first experiment that was not created by Jumba.\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Skunks]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
