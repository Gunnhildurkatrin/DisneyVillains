[[Baloo#TaleSpin|Baloo]] claims he is \"a guardian angel\" near the end of the episode.\n\nMagee helps Baloo land because he is not able to fly due to his amnesia. Magee teaches Baloo how to fly again and what the true meaning of flying is. When Baloo regains his confidence, Joe suggests he get on his way home alone, but Baloo is too scared to go without him.\n\nWhen Baloo fakes that he is sick, Joe pretends to fall off a ladder and break his leg. Baloo, fearing his friend is hurt, flies out to town to get a [[Doctor Cooper|doctor]]. But when he returns, Magee is gone and the airfield looks abandoned.\n\nThe doctor tells him Magee's story and explains he had a cane because he broke his leg in the army and then built the flight school. People considered him one of the best and some considered him the complete best. Finally, the doctor explains that Magee had passed away two decades ago.\n\nAfter this explanation, Baloo comes to realize this was a hallucination or more hinted toward, a \"guardian angel.\"\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\">\njoe magee 059.jpg\nJoe_magee_033.jpg\njoe magee 223.jpg\njoe magee 325.jpg\njoe magee 345.jpg\njoe magee 476.jpg\nThe-Old-Man-and-the-Sea-Duck-53.png\njoe magee 587.jpg|Joe after his heroic deed\n35_18.jpg|A photo of Joe with Baloo\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:McGee, Joe}}\n\n{{TaleSpin}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:TaleSpin characters]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters with disabilities]]\n[[Category:Spirits]]\n[[Category:Lions]]\n[[Category:Angels]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]"
