"[[File:Junior_Kim_Possible.png|thumb|183px]]'''Junior'''<ref>http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0398732/?ref_=tt_cl_t5</ref> (voiced by [[Diedrich Bader]])<ref>http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/Kim-Possible/Junior/</ref><ref>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0046033/</ref> is a minor character\u00a0from the animated [[Disney Channel]] show\u00a0''[[Kim Possible]]''. He is a regular in detention at [[Middleton High School]]. He appears to get along well with his other detention mates, [[Vinnie]] and [[Big Mike]].\n==History==\n\nJunior doesn't appear to be that intelligent. He looks into the detention room asking if it is the assembly, to which [[Steven Barkin|Mr. Barkin]] tells him to sit down because it is detention. Later, after Vinnie states that [[Dr. Drakken]] is using a Gravatomic Ray, Vinnie mixes up the name and calls it a \"gravamatromic\" ray. Although, in a Ron-esque moment of insight Junior is the one who states that it is a \"tiny explosive device\" attached to Kim Possible's nose.\n==Appearances==\n*\"[[Tick-Tick-Tick]]\"\n\n==Quotes==\n''(Junior is intently staring at Kim Possible)''<br />'''Kim''': What?!<br />\n'''Junior''': Never been this close to a cheerleader. Your skin is so smooth and zit-free. Like a baby's bottom.<br />'''Kim''': Eww!\n\n==Trivia==\n*Although some fans have suggested from Junior's long wavy blond hair he might be Tara's brother, his comment of never being so close to a cheerleader rules it out.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nJunior Face.jpg\nJunior (Kim Possible).jpg\n</gallery>\n==References==\n<references/>\n{{Kim Possible}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Junior}}\n[[Category:Kim Possible characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
