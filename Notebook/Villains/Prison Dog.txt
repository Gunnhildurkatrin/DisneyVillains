The dog was left with the keys to the cells in the fortress prison. When the island was raided by the [[The Crew of the Wicked Wench|crew]] of the [[Wicked Wench]], the fortress was one of the buildings set on fire with its piratical prisoners desperately attempting to lure the dog to their cell to escape.\n\n====Pirates of the Caribbean (film series)====\nIn the films, the dog was a prison dog in the [[Fort Charles]] prison of [[Port Royal]] in [[Jamaica]]. It would come to be dog-napped by [[Pintel]] and [[Ragetti]] before it was abandoned on Isla de [[Pelegostos]]. Later on, it would come into the ownership of Captain [[Edward Teague]], being used to hold the keys for the [[Pirata Codex|Pirate's Code]].\n\n===Development History===\nBecause the films were based on the original Disney Parks attraction, the scene is recreated in ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]'', and the dog makes further appearances in ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'' and ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]'' due to the dog being a popular character in the original attraction.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===Oceaneer Lab===\nArtwork of the dog by [[Marc Davis]] is hung in the [[RV Oceaneer Lab]] as part of [[Mary Oceaneer|Captain Mary Oceaneer]]'s collection.\n\n===[[Pirates of the Caribbean (ride)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]===\nIn each version of the attraction, the dog is seen near three pirates attempting to get his attention to free them.\n\nDue to the success of the attraction at [[Disneyland]], the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction was later constructed at [[Magic Kingdom]], [[Tokyo Disneyland]], and [[Disneyland Paris]] where it still features the prison scene still with the dog.\n\n===[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Battle for the Sunken Treasure|Battle for the Sunken Treasure]]===\nThe scene where guests pass through the caverns scene with three pirates and the prison dog was redesigned where the dog and the prisoners appear, but are shown as dead skeletons. The whistling audio from the original attraction plays during this vignette.\n\n==Film appearances==\n\n====''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl|The Curse of the Black Pearl]]''====\nThe prison dog is the keeper of the keys to the jail in [[Port Royal]], he carries the keys in his mouth, the prisoners vainly trying to get the keys.\n\nAfter the raid on the town under attack by the ''Black Pearl'', Jack tries to get the keys from the dog and almost does, but when other pirates come into the jail, he gets scared and runs off.\n\n====''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|Dead Man's Chest]]''====\nThe dog appears again in ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|Dead Man's Chest]]'' with Pintel and Ragetti after they have escaped prison and are headed for Pelegosto to search for the [[Black Pearl]]. He was named \"Poochie\" by Pintel until he was left on Pelegosto. Later, he was chased by cannibals. In a post-credits scene, it is revealed that the dog becomes the chief of the Pelegosto tribe.\n\n====''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|At World's End]]''====\nIn ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|At World's End]]'', the dog is the keeper of the Pirata Codex keys on [[Shipwreck Cove|Shipwreck Island]]. Captain Teague explains the dog's presence by saying, \"Sea turtles, mate,\" a reference to Jack Sparrow's tale of his own escape from being marooned.\n\n==Other Appearances==\n\n===Printed Materials===\n\n====The Price of Freedom====\nIn this movie-continuity book, the dog was the pet of Captain Teague long before the events of the first film when Jack Sparrow was a teenager. Jack had the duty of feeding the dog, in doing so giving the dog a taste for rum. When Jack's friend Christophe-Julien de Rapi\u00e8r was accused of going rogue from the brethren, Jack and his ally Esmeralda stole the dog's keys to free him and escape Shipwreck Island.\n\n====The Ghost Gallery====\nIn the Ghost Gallery storyline created to explain the backstory of [[the Haunted Mansion]], the prison dog was mentioned as part of the unofficial history. In this story, the prison dog was the ancestor of the [[Hellhound]] in the Haunted Mansion which was the pet of [[Master Gracey]] which itself was the grandfather of the [[Caretaker]]'s Dog. The prison dog was also explained to be the ancestor of the ''Fort [[Mark Twain|Sam Clemens]]'' scene of [[Pirate's Lair on Tom Sawyer Island|Tom Sawyer's Island]], and the dog [[Rover (Carousel of Progress)|Rover]] from [[Carousel of Progress]].\n\n===Video Games===\n\n====[[Disney Crossy Road]]====\nThe dog is a playable character within this mobile-game.\n\n====[[Kinect Disneyland Adventures]]====\nThe dog appears in the dungeons of Puerto Dorado (here a pirate haven frequented by [[Blackbeard]]) where starving prisoners try to pry its key from its jaw. The player tosses food to the prisoners before their guide [[Black Barty]] makes a comment about having run afoul of the dog before and how it would never give up its keys.\n\n====[[Sea of Thieves: A Pirate's Life]]====\nThe dog first appears in this game, keeping the keys for the jail-cell that Jack Sparrow is kept in. The dog can also be purchased as a pet at the Pirate Emporium.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In ''The Curse of the Black Pearl'' in one scene where Jack Sparrow is sent to prison, he says an allusion to the original ride saying that the \"dog is never going to move\".\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nPotcahsj.png\nPotcajhrfh.png\nDead Mans Chest Prison Dog.png\nPotcaJSGHFR.png\nTeague-jack-prison-dog.jpg\nPotC1 0643.jpg\nPirates2-disneyscreencaps.com-5099.jpg\nPotc2 5234.jpg|The dog crowned a chief.\nDpw02934802934823.jpg|A plush of the dog from the Disney Wishables line\nPirates-of-the-caribbean-canine.jpg\nEmojiBlitzPrisonDog.png|Prison Dog\u2019s emoji in [[Disney Emoji Blitz]]\nSea.of.Thieves-PrisonDog.png|in ''Sea of Thieves: A Pirate's Life''\n</gallery>\n\n{{Pirates of the Caribbean}}\n{{Disney Crossy Road}}\n{{Disney Emoji Blitz}}\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Pirates of the Caribbean characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Kinect Disneyland Adventures characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Crossy Road characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]"
