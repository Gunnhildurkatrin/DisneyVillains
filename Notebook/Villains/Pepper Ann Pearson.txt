She is a geeky and unpredictable 12-year-old 7th grade girl who attends [[Hazelnut Middle School]] with her best friends [[Milo Kamalani]] and [[Nicky Little]].\n\n==Background==\nPepper Ann lives in Hazelnut (implied to be in either [[Rhode Island]] or [[Florida]]) in a duplex house with her divorced mother [[Lydia Pearson|Lydia]] and younger tomboyish sister [[Moose Pearson|Moose]]. Her Uncle [[JoJo Diggety]], Aunt [[Janie Diggety]] and cousin Ned live on the other half of the duplex. It is established that Pepper Ann, or P.A. as her friends and family sometimes call her, has a very big and extended family who are all involved with her life in one form or another. Despite her father [[Chuck Pearson|Chuck]] not living with them anymore, he still occasionally visits to check in on them.\n\nThroughout the series' run, Pepper Ann's motive is to obtain a level of popularity or \"coolness\" among her peers. Her views on what are defined as \"cool\" tend to be flawed and always end up making her situation worse than it was before. She also attempts to vie for the affection of 8th grader [[Craig Bean]] whom she has a massive crush on. Throughout the second half of the series, the two of them become casual acquaintances, almost on the verge of being a true couple.\n\nShe continuously expresses her desire to become a Nobel prize winning scientist. This is ironic as the teacher that is constantly giving her a hard time is her science teacher [[Roland Carter]], as she has a habit of showing up to his class late and getting handed a detention slip. She considers him a nuisance, but every now and then will see things from his perspective and gain sympathy, only for Mr. Carter to go right back to stifling her with detention slips and calling her out on her behavior.\n\nIn \"[[The Finale]]\", it is established that in the series' version of [[2013]], Pepper Ann becomes an educational video game developer; ironically combining her least favorite and favorite things together. She takes great pride in her work, but reaches out to her friends for advice on a game. It is also heavily implied that she and Craig begin dating.\n\n===Personality===\nPepper Ann is rather intelligent and imaginative for a girl her age. However, being 12 years old (as established in \"[[Doppelganger Didi]]\") she can still sometimes overthink or overanalyze a situation. When this happens, she will consult [[Pepper Ann's reflection|her reflection]] for internal advice. Pepper Ann is also sometimes cynical and sarcastic and will drop a quip or two when she perceives something as strange or foreign to her. Her main objective is to establish some kind of reputation or image based on what she believes to be acceptable. This usually results in her schemes backfiring in unintentional, but usually hilarious ways. Occasionally, she is shown to be manipulative in order to get what she wants, but will learn her lesson and realize that she is wrong. Pepper Ann is ultimately a good person who cares about her friends and family. While she sometimes has trouble accepting certain things, she is quick to adapt and is quick to be motivated whenever something peaks her interest.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nPepper Ann is a tall and slender Caucasian girl with long puffy red hair that she has tied into a ponytail and wears flat oval shaped glasses. Her signature outfit consists of a purple t-shirt that is slightly lifted in the front and a dark yellow skirt with a strange green and orange circle pattern on it. She has light blue leggings, yellow socks and black and white sneakers.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Pepper Ann originated as a comic strip in YM Magazine and was meant to be a cartoon extension of series creator Sue Rose. Her appearance was also described as being similar to Rose's soda mascot character [[wikipedia:Fido Dido|Fido Dido]].\n*Throughout the series, it is heavily implied that Pepper Ann is from a Jewish background. In \"[[Dances with Ignorance]]\", her family is traced back to English, Belgian, Polish, Russian, Spanish and Navajo Indian.\n*In \"[[Cat Scan]]\", it is revealed that Pepper Ann has a long scar on her arm that she got from Steve. However, for continuity reasons, it is only visible in that episode.\n*Pepper Ann possibly suffers from Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD). This is especially evident in the episode \"[[Peer Counselor P.A.]]\" where she has difficulty paying attention to people.\n*Despite not being the best student in Hazelnut Middle School, Pepper Ann apparently knows Morse code, as seen in \"[[Portrait of the Artist as a Young Milo]]\". In \"[[Strike it or Not]]\", she is told by Mr. Carter that she is actually her best student, despite the two of them not seeing eye to eye.\n*Pepper Ann and her mother Lydia made a brief cameo near the end of the ''[[House of Mouse]]''\u00a0pilot episode \"[[The Stolen Cartoons]]\", when [[Tantor]] throws [[Pete]] out of the building, causing Lydia to warn Pepper Ann, \"Don't touch the villain, dear.\" Notably, Pepper Ann and her mother are the only characters created for a Disney television cartoon to ever appear in that show, aside from\u00a0[[Ludwig von Drake]].\n*Pepper Ann's design was a partial inspiration for the design of ''[[Amphibia]]'''s [[Anne Boonchuy]].<ref>[https://mobile.twitter.com/DisneySchedules/status/1297566885278613510 According to the AMA on the #Amphibia subreddit, creator Matt Braly @Radrappy, is a huge fan of Pepper Ann. Braly says that Anne's design somewhat took some influence on the character.]</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n===Early concepts===\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"145\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" bordercolor=\"transparent\">\nPepper Ann concept 1.jpg\nPepper Ann concept 2.jpg\nPepper Ann concept 3.jpg\nPepper Ann concept 4.jpg\nPepper Ann concept 5.jpg\nPepper Ann concept 6.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Stills===\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"145\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" bordercolor=\"transparent\">\n600full-pepper-ann-screenshot.jpg\nBye Bye Trinket.JPG\nGreenSleeves.jpg\nShot1364.png\nShot1363.png\nShot1361.png\nPabf.JPG\nCruchpod.JPG\nShot1362.png\nPresenting Stewart Waldinger.jpg\nPepper-Ann-Leaning-pepper-ann-2923122-290-400.jpg\n600full-pepper-ann-screenshot.gif\nmompep.jpg\npaplush.jpg\nvlcsnap-2012-05-03-04h00m11s185.jpg\nChar 30370.jpg\nPepperAnn4.png\nPepperAnn1.png\nPepperAnn2.jpg\nPepperAnn2.png\nPepperAnn.png\nP.A.
