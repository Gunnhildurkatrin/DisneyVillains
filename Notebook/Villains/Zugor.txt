He is the \"monster\" feared by Young [[Tarzan]] and almost all the animals, even [[Sabor]]. He claims he is alone because he got old and unable to keep up with his migrating family. However, when Tarzan tells the gorilla he is a danger to his own family, Zugor is rattled by this revelation. Tarzan blackmails Zugor into helping him figure out what he is; in return, Tarzan will not tell anyone he is the \"monster\". As time passes throughout the film, Zugor grows fond of Tarzan after he builds him a nest, even letting him be a \"Zugor-in training feeling sorry for him that Tarzan felt he didn't belong anywhere.\" When Tarzan accidentally reveals Zugor's secret, he is angry and hurt at the betrayal, which results in his tree getting destroyed by Kago and Uto. He later comes to Tarzan's rescue with a vine for him to use to terrorize the two brothers. While Tarzan deals with them, Zugor trades insults with [[Mama Gunda]], which ends with him accidentally saying that she has beautiful eyes, causing them to become enamored with each other. After the fight, Gunda and her boys leave to live with the Zugor and fix his tree. When [[Kago and Uto]] start whining about having to fix the tree, Zugor tells them not to argue with their mother, and promptly replied to their stuttering with several \"Boo-hoo for you's to put them in their place.\"\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nZugor (Tarzan II).jpg\ntarzan II zugor.jpg\nZugor.jpg\ntarzanII-Zugor.jpg\ntarzan2-Zugor.jpg\nTarzan_II_Mama_Gunda's_Sons.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Tarzan}}\n[[ru:\u0417\u0443\u0433\u043e\u0440]]\n\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Gorillas]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:African characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Tarzan characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Deuteragonists]]"
