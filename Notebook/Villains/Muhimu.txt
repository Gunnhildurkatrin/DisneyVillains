On the suggestion of his father [[Simba]], [[Kion]] and the Lion Guard lead Muhimu, Swala, and their herds to Mbali Fields, where there is plenty of grass for the two herds to share.\n\nHowever, in order to get there, The Guard has to take the herds through [[The Outlands]] after the route they were intending to use is blocked by rocks. While Swala and the majority of the herds doubt Kion's leadership, Muhimu stands up for him and trusts him.\n\nWhen traveling through the Outlands, Muhimu reveals she's pregnant, (something she was trying to tell Bunga during the whole trip but to no avail), goes into labor, and gives birth to a son. Soon after, the herds are attacked by [[Janja]], [[Cheezi]], and [[Chungu]], but the zebras try their best to protect Muhimu and her son. While Kion and Bunga deal with Cheezi and Chungu, Janja breaks through the protection and tries to attack the zebras, but is kicked in the face by Muhimu's son.\n\nAfter the hyenas leave, Muhimu, her son, herd, and Swala's herd reach Mbali Fields.\n\n===\"[[Babysitter Bunga]]\"===\nMuhimu and her herd are being attacked by Reirei's Pack until they get saved by the Lion Guard. She goes to hang out with her friends at the Watering Hole while Bunga watches Hamu.\n\n==Relationships==\n\n===Family===\n====[[Hamu]]====\n\nMuhimu has a close relationship with her son and despairs whenever he is in a dangerous situation as seen when the hyenas' attack, but is very proud of him, as seen when he kicks [[Janja]] during the fight and when he and his friends defeat the jackals and love him a lot.\n\n===Friends===\n====[[Bunga]]====\n\nBunga and Muhimu didn't get along from the start, mainly because she sat on him and she referred to him like a mongoose and a hedgehog. But during the migration, they start to get along after Bunga saves her from a flood. The pair soon became good friends, and Bunga even helps protect her when she's giving birth.\n\nSometime later, Muhimu entrusted Bunga with Hamu and declared him to be the best babysitter ever after teaching her son how to defend himself.\n\n====[[Kion]]====\n\nIn the beginning, Muhimu has little faith in Kion, as seen during the migration.\n\nBut when the young leader starts to show his best efforts, Muhimu softens and begins to understand Kion, even offering him her support when the other animals lose their own faith in the cub after she accidentally blocks off the path to Mbail Fields by causing a minor stampede in excitement.\n\nSince then, the two remain on good terms, with Muhimu now knowing she can always have faith in the cub.\n\n====[[Swala]]====\n\nWhen Muhimu and Swala are first seen, the pair are in the middle of a tense argument over a depleting grazing ground. After Kion begins to lead them to their new grazing grounds, the pair seem to become more neutral towards each other.\n\nWhen Muhimu enters labor in the\u00a0 Outlands, Swala is only too happy to support her as a friend, staying behind with her to ensure that all goes well.\n\n====[[Twiga]]====\n\nTwiga is a good friend of Muhimu who asked her questions to what happened to Hamu. She told her Bunga is taking care of Hamu and will keep him safe from jackals.\n\n====[[Simba]]====\n\nMuhimu and Simba are on good terms since he's her king. However, she didn't like it when Simba didn't tell the herds about Scar.\n\n===Acquaintances===\n====[[Fuli]], [[Beshte]], and [[Ono]]====\n\nFuli, Beshte, and Ono are good friends of Muhimu who help her and her herd to the Mbalil Fields to safety. They protect her from hyenas and jackals.\n\n===[[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]]===\n\nMuhimu and her herd go over to\u00a0 Mizimu Grove and watch Timon and Pumbaa sing their song \"[[Tujiinue]].\"\n\n===Enemies===\n====[[Janja's Clan]]====\n\nJanja's Clan tried to attack Muhimu when she was giving birth to Hamu. Despite his diminutive size, Hamu saves his mother from them after kicking Janja in the face.\n\n====[[Reirei's Pack]]====\nReirei's Pack attack Muhimu's herd, but the Lion Guard (alongside Bunga) saved them. Thanks to this, Muhimu praised Bunga for taking care of her baby to defend himself from jackals.\n\n==Trivia==\n* Muhimu is the only character in the series to feature a different voice actress for the UK release (but only for one episode).\n* Muhimu is the second character in the series to feature a different voice actor after their debut the second being [[Mufasa]] (but only for the UK release).\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nImagetlgtmfmmuhimu.png\n2017-07-16-23 53 37.png|Muhimu tasks Bunga with babysitting her son, Hamu\n2017-07-16-23 57 34.png|Muhimu converses with Twiga at the watering hole\n2017-07-17-00 17 09.png|Muhimu declares Bunga to be the best babysitter ever\nBabysitter-bunga (45).png|Panic and run!\nBabysitter-bunga (255).png|A relaxed Muhimu\nBabysitter-bunga (432).png\nBabysitter-bunga (625).png|Muhimu is impressed\nNuzzleson.png|Muhimu nuzzles her newborn son\nResumetangle.png|Muhimu fights with Swala over a depleted grazing ground\nSodoIMuhi.png|Muhimu stands up for Kion before the disagreeable herds\nThe-mbali-fields-migration (35).png|Muhimu battles Swala\nThe-mbali-fields-migration (62).png|Fighting\nThe-mbali-fields-migration (198).png|Muhimu stampedes\nThe-mbali-fields-migration (207).png|Bunga pushes Muhimu\nThe-mbali-fields-migration (236).png\nThe-mbali-fields-migration (293).png|Saved by Bunga\nThe-mbali-fields-migration (338).png|Promising Kion\nThe-mbali-fields-migration (472).png|The new mother\n</gallery>\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{The Lion King}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Zebras]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:The Lion Guard characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:African characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
