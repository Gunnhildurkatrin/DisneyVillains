She is the queen of England and wife of [[King James]].\n\n==Background==\nPrincess Anna Frederiksdotter \"Anne\", was a Danish princess and the youngest daughter of King [[wikipedia:Frederick II of Denmark|Frederick II]] and Queen [[wikipedia:Sophie of Mecklenburg-G\u00fcstrow|Sophie of Denmark]]. Though a disappointment to her father\u00a0who had hoped for a son (similar to Elizabeth I, daughter of King Henry VIII of England by [[wikipedia:Anne Boleyn|Anne Boleyn]], his second queen), Anne grew up in a close-knit family thanks to her loving mother.\n\n===Personality===\nQueen Anne is portrayed as being kind, gentle and compassionate. However, it is known that the historical figure was far different.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nQueen Anne is portrayed\u00a0quite accurately\u00a0as a typical Scandinavian beauty, with blonde hair and blue eyes, much like her historical counterpart.\n\n==Role in the film==\nAs\u00a0the beautiful daughter of\u00a0the late King of Denmark, Anne\u00a0married [[King James]]\u00a0of England\u00a0in 1589, at a very young age, bearing him\u00a0seven children (who do not appear in the film); three of them survived infancy, including the future Charles I. Although the marriage was arranged, the two were in love.\n\nIn the film, she is very kind, level-headed, and is usually able to help her husband calm down when he was about to lose his temper, much like [[Mary Darling]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nPocahontas2-disneyscreencaps.com-7028.jpg\npocahontas2-disneyscreencaps.com-284.jpg\npocahontas2-disneyscreencaps.com-4020.jpg\npocahontas2-disneyscreencaps.com-5264.jpg\npocahontas2-disneyscreencaps.com-5501.jpg\npocahontas2-disneyscreencaps.com-5636.jpg\npocahontas2-disneyscreencaps.com-7005.jpg|Queen Anne insisting her husband to listen to Pocahontas.\npocahontas2-disneyscreencaps.com-7045.jpg|\"There is no gold, is there?\"\npocahontas2-disneyscreencaps.com-7119.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Anne is very calm and opposed to her short-tempered husband. She is much like [[Queen Leah]] and [[Mary Darling]].\n*Queen Anne is one of very few Disney characters to be based on a well known\u00a0historical figure.\n*The real Queen Anne was quite different to the character, being frivolous and self-indulgent.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Pocahontas}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Anne}}\n[[Category:Queens]]\n[[Category:Pocahontas characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Historical characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:English characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Scandinavian characters]]\n[[Category:Characters based on real people]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]"
