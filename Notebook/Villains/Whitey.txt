He is [[Willie the Whale]]'s sidekick and mentor.\n\n==Background==\nWhitey is Willie's friend, who enjoys hearing him sing and would like for his friend's dreams of singing professionally to come true. He is the one who brings Willie the newspaper that lets him know the Opera Director [[Tetti-Tatti]] is on his way, which ultimately leads to Willie's demise (Whitey was unaware of Tetti-Tatti's true agenda and thought that he only wanted to make Willie's singing talent known to the world). At the end of his segment, Whitey mourns at the spot where Willie used to be but only to find out he died from a battle between Tetti-Tatti.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Make Mine Music]]''===\nWhitey is first seen staring at an article of the newspaper in the ocean, which he picks up with his beak and shows to Willie about the article of Tetti-Tatti looking for a disappeared opera singer where he shows the news article to a trio of seals about Willie wanting to sing like an opera singer, along with two pelicans just as Willie bids a farewell to the seals and pelicans. Later, Whitey flies into Tetti-Tatti's telescope and points to him that Willie is coming, wanting his dream to be a great singer come true. When Willie sings in front of Tetti-Tatti and his sailor trio, he and the sailors even cheer for Willie's performance for having a great voice. Afterwards, Whitey teaches Willie how to be a great singer as he was no ordinary whale. After practicing, Willie finally gets his dream come true in singing in an opera.\n\nLater during an opera performance with Willie, Whitey can be seen cheering for Willie's performance along with the pelicans, seals and a flock of seagulls in the audience. However, after Willie's last performance, Willie ultimately dies where Tetti-Tatti fires a harpoon at him, causing Whitey to mourn the loss over his friend - though he hears Willie singing in heaven at the end.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"120\">\nMakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps com-5409.jpg|Whitey showing his boss the article on the newspaper about [[Willie the Whale|the famous him]]\nMakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps com-5423.jpg|Whitey showing his seal pals the article on the newspaper about Willie\nMakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps com-5430.jpg|Whitey showing his pelican pals the article on the newspaper about Willie\nMakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps com-5543.jpg|Whitey talking to Tetti-Tatti\nMakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps com-5826.jpg|Whitey showing Tetti-Tatti's crew the number of Willie's uvulae while playing the number 2\nMakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps com-5859.jpg|Whitey hitting Willie's 3rd throat which is the bass to show Tetti-Tatti and his men\nMakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps com-5874.jpg|Whitey showing Tetti-Tatti's crew the number of Willie's uvulae while playing the number 3\nMakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps com-5941.jpg|Whitey giving Willie an A-OK gesture for his job well-done\nMakeminemusic-disneyscreencaps com-6412.jpg|Whitey mourning Willie after he is murdered by Tetti-Tatti\n1948 MELODY TIME.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Make Mine Music}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Make Mine Music characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Schoolteachers]]\n[[Category:Servants]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Seagulls]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]"
