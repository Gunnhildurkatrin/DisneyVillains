Everyone in Passamaquoddy thought the entire crew didn't survive, but he turned out to be the only one who did, unfortunately, with memory loss. Luckily, one day, while he was laying in his bed in the hospital, an invisible [[Elliott]] (who had been tasked by [[Pete (Pete's Dragon)|Pete]] to find him) tipped it over,\u00a0causing him to fall\u00a0and hit his head, thus, getting his memory back. He went back to Passamaquoddy and reunited with Nora. At the end of the film, he sees Elliott and exclaims, \"There really is a dragon!\" and waves goodbye to him along with Pete, Nora, and [[Lampie]]. Presumably, he marries Nora and becomes\u00a0Pete's adoptive father.\n\n{{Pete's Dragon}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Pete's Dragon characters]]\n[[Category:Sailors]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Parents]]"
