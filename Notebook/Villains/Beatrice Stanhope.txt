In the end, Ursula and George are married anyway, and Beatrice is forced to accept it. Next morning, Ursula found out and scold her for what she did, and confesses that she loves George.\n\nMuch to Beatrice's dismay, Arthur supports his daughter to go after him. When George marries Ursula in the jungle, she is irritated by the situation is seen dancing with an ape in the ending.\n\n===''[[George of the Jungle 2]]''===\nBeatrice returns in the sequel, this time as the main antagonist. She is still not satisfied with Ursula ditching her high class status for George, has presumably divorced Arthur and is scheming with Lyle to get Ursula and [[George Jr.]] back to civilization, steal the deed to Ape Mountain from Ape and rid themselves of George for good. \n\nWhen she first steps foot into the African jungles and reveals her reasoning to the jungle guides, [[N'Dugo, Kip, and Baleto|N'Dugo, Kip and Baleto]], why she does all these aforementioned actions which is because she refused the idea of George Junior growing up in the jungle \"an illiterate savage\", The three guides, repulsed by that remark, throw Beatrice off the cliff, but she survives, because the narrator remarks, \"Sorry, we can't kill Beatrice. If she dies, we have no stories.\" Upon arriving at George and Ursula's treehouse during George Jr.'s fifth birthday, she gifts both Ursula and George Jr. numerous presents from San Francisco in an attempt to get them to leave for civilization, while also chastising George for his primitive ways of giving presents to his son, and urges George to abandon both Ursula and George Junior so that the two could return back to civilization. \n\nIt is revealed however that Ape is debt-ridden and does not have the deed after all, but George does. Hence, he fly to Las Vegas to help Ape out while Beatrice finds various ways to get Ursula to leave George with the help of both Lyle, Ursula's friends, and a hypnotist named Armando, who succeeds in hypnotizing Ursula to be Lyle's wife. She then takes Ursula and George Jr. back to her home in San Francisco where George eventually rescues them after learning about Lyle\u2019s scheme to destroy the jungle.\n\nIn the end, George saves the day, Lyle is pulled out of the story, and Beatrice, after getting kissed by a gorilla, accepts defeat with dignity once more.\n\n{{George of the Jungle}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stanhope, Beatrice}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:George of the Jungle characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
