He rescues [[Pluto]] from freezing in the snow, after which the two are found by Mickey and Donald to be drunk on Bolivar's own brandy. Bolivar is unusual for a Disney character in that he is not anthropomorphised beyond showing an unusually broad range of facial expressions; he is actually represented with the characteristics of his species.\n\n==Comic History==\nLater on he appeared in the newspaper comic strips by Bob Karp and Al Taliaferro as Donald's pet dog. Ever since 1938, Bolivar has been a prominent member of the Duck family. He was a recurring character in [[Carl Barks]]' comics, as the family' pet dog and companion for [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|Huey Dewey, and Louie]], and appears now and then in recent stories (the Disney artist Daniel Branca had Bolivar as one of his favourite characters).\n\nIn some comic strips, Bolivar had a son named Behemoth.\n\nBolivar has also been called Bornworthy and Bernie, possibly to avoid any political implications (see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sim%C3%B3n_Bol%C3%ADvar Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]). Nevertheless from [[1992]] onward the original name Bolivar has almost always been used in the United States.\n\n==Trivia==\n*While Bolivar did not return to animation, a look-alike named Toliver appeared in ''[[More Kittens]]'' ([[December 19]], [[1936]]).\n**Also, another St. Bernard puppy named [[Ronnie]] appeared in at least two Pluto featurettes: ''[[The Purloined Pup]]'' ([[1946]]) and ''[[Pueblo Pluto]]'' ([[1949]]).\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nBolivar.jpg\n24210.jpg\n24207.jpg\nTumblr n1scdfSDfE1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\nBolivar_disney.jpg|Bolivar as he appears in comics\n</gallery>\n\n==External Links==\n*[http://users.cwnet.com/xephyr/rich/dzone/hoozoo/bolivar.html Bolivar - Disney's HooZoo]\n*{{Inducks character|BOL}}\n\n{{Wikipedia|List of Donald Duck characters}}\n\n[[da:Bernhard (karakter)]]\n[[es:Bolivar, el San Bernardo]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
