Absolem is a caterpillar that appears in both the real world and [[Underland]], however, he doesn't speak in the real world. He was voiced by the late [[Alan Rickman]].\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''===\nAbsolem seems to be Underland's oracle. When there is a problem or uncertainty, Absolem is who the characters in Underland go to for answers. He is the keeper of the Oraculum; a compendium of Wonderland's history.\n\nAbsolem appears in the real world on two separate occasions. One is in caterpillar form when Alice is proposed to by Hamish. When Alice notices a caterpillar on Hamish's shoulder, she, being the \"gentle giant\" she is (compared to Absolem), rescues Absolem by placing him on the gazebo. Later, when she stands on a ship bound for China, she sees him in butterfly form and she recognizes him by name.\n\n===''[[Alice Through the Looking Glass]]''===\nAbsolem returns in this film, still in his butterfly form with Alan Rickman reprising his role. It is to noted here that this was Alan Rickman's last work before his death.\n\nWhen Alice returns to London, she notices Absolem, who guides her to a looking glass. After passing through the looking glass and encountering the dangers within, Absolem appears and informs her of the circumstances of his appearance. Before she leaves into Underland, he warns her to watch her step.\n\n==Video Games==\n===''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 video game)|Alice in Wonderland]]''===\nAbsolem makes an appearance as an NPC in the Wii and PC versions of the game and as a playable character in the DS version.\n\n===''[[Disney Universe]]''===\nAbsolem is a free downloadable costume on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox versions of the game.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nOlder-Concept-Art-alice-in-wonderland-2010-10810717-700-895.jpg\nAlice-in-wonderland-concept-art-07.jpg\nThe-Caterpillar-Character-Art-by-Alice-In-Wonderland-Character-Designer-Michael-Kutsche-alice-in-wonderland-2010-10708238-975-1200.jpg\nHookah-alice.jpg\nAbsolem.png\nAbsolem_disney_universe.jpg|Absolem suit in ''Disney Universe''\ntumblr_nfl4kuXcjw1rcb0d2o1_500.jpg|Absolem as a butterfly\nATTLG Still 04.jpg\nAlice TTLA Butterfly Absolem.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Alice in Wonderland}}\n{{Disney Crossy Road}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Caterpillars]]\n[[Category:Disney Universe Suits]]\n[[Category:Butterflies]]\n[[Category:Mentors]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Disney Crossy Road characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]"
