He got fired from his job, \"one time Pim was messing with the New Ager\", and turned Lloyd into a 2-year-old, \"for telling his boss he made a 'poopie'.\" Some time later, he and his family took a trip in a used time machine and got stuck in the year [[2004]]. After being there for two years, they returned to the future, leaving behind a caveman named [[Curtis]]. He was a Pozotronic engineer, worked at WizardCorp in 2121, and loves \"older music\". He was paranoid about the government (and [[Neil Hackett]]) figuring out he and his family are from the future. During their stay, he and Curtis got jobs at the Mantis hardware store.\n{{Phil of the Future}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Diffy, Lloyd}}\n[[Category:Phil of the Future characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Grandparents]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Time travelers]]\n[[Category:Engineers]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
