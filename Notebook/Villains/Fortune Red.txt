It is unknown if Fortune Red is or was at any point in his life a real person or pirate. Furthermore it is unknown if Red is intended to be alive in the machine, immortal or undead in the machine, or made in the likeness of a Fortune Red who existed in the park's lore.\n\n===Appearance===\nFortune Red looks like a traditional 18th-century pirate who wears a purple coat and jabot. He has ginger hair, a large beard and a sailor's cap with a red bandana. In his inventory is a pipe, a blunderbuss, a skull with an eyepatch, and a treasure-map.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===Disneyland===\nFortune Red is a fortune-teller machine found in [[New Orleans Square]]. He was originally located in the ''Pirate's Arcade'' and then later moved to the ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean (franchise)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' themed shop, ''Pieces of Eight''. When activated, ''[[Yo Ho (A Pirate's Life for Me)|Yo Ho, Yo Ho]]'' plays and he deals out a card with a fortune on one side and a history of pirate flags on the other.\n\nRed is one of three fortune-teller machines found in Disneyland Park. The other two are [[Esmeralda (Fortune-Teller)|Esmeralda]] on ''[[Main Street, U.S.A.]]'' and [[Shrunken Ned]] in ''[[Adventureland]]''.\n\n====PlayDisneyParks Mobile App====\nWith the PlayDisneyParks app, you are rewarded with a story regarding the fortune tellers when activating them and get further interactions through the mobile app.\n\n===[[Kinect Disneyland Adventures]]===\nHe also appears in the video game ''Kinect Disneyland Adventures'', where he was voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]]. He appeared outside of ''[[Port Royal]] Curios and Curiosities'' rather than his traditional placement. He is also expressly portrayed as being a living character in this game, being able to move and talk of his own will.\n\nHe is given a relationship with the pirate [[Black Barty]], the game's analogue for [[Jack Sparrow]]. Red is characterized as being friendly with Barty but mocking of him and easily annoyed by the boisterous pirate captain.\n\n==Trivia==\n*There is a portrait in Pieces of Eight showing a ginger pirate who bares a passing resemblance to Fortune Red. It is unknown if they are intended to be the same character given the resemblance and proximity.\n{{Pirates of the Caribbean}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Pirates of the Caribbean characters]]\n[[Category:Kinect Disneyland Adventures characters]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Pirates of the Caribbean objects]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:New Orleans Square attractions]]\n[[Category:Machines]]\n[[Category:Pirates of the Caribbean attractions]]"
