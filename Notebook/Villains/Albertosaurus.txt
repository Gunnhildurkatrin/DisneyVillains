"[[File:Game_Albertosaurus.jpg|250px|thumb]]\n'''''Albertosaurus''''' is a genus of tyrannosaurid theropod dinosaurs that lived in western North America during the Late Cretaceous Period, about 70 million years ago.\n\n==Background==\n===Real-Life Information===\nThe type species, A. sarcophagus, was apparently restricted in range to the modern-day Canadian province of Alberta, after which the genus is named. Scientists disagree on the content of the genus, with some recognizing Gorgosaurus libratus as a second species.\n\nAs a tyrannosaurid, Albertosaurus was a bipedal predator with tiny, two-fingered hands and a massive head with dozens of large, sharp teeth. It may have been at the top of the food chain in its local ecosystem. Although relatively large for a theropod, Albertosaurus was much smaller than its more famous relative Tyrannosaurus, probably weighing between 2 to 4 metric tons and between 28 to 33 feet in length.\n\nSince the first discovery in 1884, fossils of more than thirty individuals have been recovered, providing scientists with a more detailed knowledge of Albertosaurus anatomy than is available for most other tyrannosaurids. The discovery of 26 individuals at one site provides evidence of pack behavior and allows studies of ontogeny and population biology which are impossible with lesser-known dinosaurs.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Disney's Dinosaur (video game)|Disney's Dinosaur]]''===\nThese dinosaurs can be only found in the video game.  They came in 2 varieties: the green one bites at the player, and the red one can pounce.\n===[[Dinosaur (Disney's Animal Kingdom attraction)|DINOSAUR]]===\nIn the park attraction, a fossilized Albertosaurus skull and footprints are among the fossils in the ride queue's exhibits.\n==Information==\n*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albertosaurus Albertosaurus on Wikipedia]\n\n{{Dinosaur}}\n[[Category:Dinosaurs]]\n[[Category:Dinosaur characters]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric animals]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric characters]]"
