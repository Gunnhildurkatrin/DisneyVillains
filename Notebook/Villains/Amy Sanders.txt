She is in a band and is not very responsible. She is practically like an older version of Kate, but only far more self centered and immature.\n\n==History==\nKate and Amy seem to have a rocky relationship, as shown in the episode \"Party Over Here\". \n\nShe invited only her own friends who proceeded to deliberately break stuff. She also ignored Kate's request for a chocolate birthday cake because she liked strawberry, and she didn't even know that it was Kate's birthday. When she '''does''' find out, she only wishes Kate a happy birthday before returning to the party. \n\nKate is also shown to be a lot nicer and mature than Amy, despite Amy being older than Kate.\n\nAmy also appeared in \"Clue-Less\" and \"Xtreme Xmas\".\n\n==Appearances==\n===Season 2===\n*Party Over Here\n*Xtreme Xmas\n*Clue-Less\n\n==Trivia==\n*Cousin Amy was portrayed by [[Haylie Duff]], [[Hilary Duff]]'s older sister.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sanders, Amy}}\n\n{{Lizzie McGuire}}\n[[Category:Lizzie McGuire characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
