Most of her fur is grey, but she has white legs and a black pattern on her head. She also has light-blue scleras.\n\n== Personality ==\nShe is friendly, social, brave and intelligent. She also has easy humor, laughing at every blunder Dylan or spanking a sarcastic remark when he knows lost calling him <nowiki>''city boy''</nowiki>.\n\nInitially, Summer had a bad opinion of Dylan because of his derogatory remarks about the locals, that she found offensive and insulting. Summer was also annoyed at the mere sight of [[Dolly (101 Dalmatian Street)|Dolly]] and [[Spike (101 Dalmatian Street)|Spike]]'s crush.\n\nAlthough their bad start, She seems to have a crush on [[Dylan]] later, when Dylan apologized for making a mistake on the locals. She even smiled after Dylan just touched her nose because he was too embarrassed to exchange a kiss.\n\n== Background ==\nSummer is first seen observing the arrival of the Dalmatians in Cornwall.\n\nAs it begins to rain, Summer comes to take shelter in the Dalamtian bus while seeing with amusement Dylan hanging on his tent and blown away by the wind. Confusing this with a game, she asks Dolly what<nowiki>'s its name and the Dalmatian responds '' Born that way ''</nowiki>.\n\nWhen the rain is over, Summer comes to see Dylan looking at a map. The border collie turns out to know a lot about constellations just comparing the patterns on Dylan's ear with Canis Major, which amazes Dylan because he didn<nowiki>'t believe that someone ''so far from civilization'' could know so much, which upsets Summer. Dylan tries to catch up but only makes matters worse by saying that there isn'</nowiki>t much to see in the sticks. Still a little upset, Summer then remarks that Dylan has a wasp on his nose, causing the Dalmatian to panic and just fun for the border collie. Dylan then collides with Bessy the Cow and releases another demeaning reflections on the locals, again to Summer 's indignation.\n\nShe later finds the Dalmatians gone in the wrong direction for the beach and warns them of their mistake but Dylan does as he pleases and then stumbles on the trail and brambles. Seeing her brother in chains fall after fall, Dolly prefers to follow Summer.\n\nSummer successfully drives the Dalmatians to the beach, and along with Dolly, taunts a bramble and vines covered Dylan who came last. Right after Spike's intro, Dylan saves Dorothy from Chips the Seagull and complains about the locals again in front of Summer, upsetting her yet again. When Dylan and Dante set off to find Dizzy and Dee Dee who have entered a dark cave, Summer offers her local knowledge to help them. The trio eventually find the two pups and save them inextreme from a landslide. After getting out of the cave, Summer receives an apology from Dylan who finally realizes that all the locals are not bad news. Dylan then introduces himself to her and vice versa as they hadn't done during their first meeting, starting the beginning of a crush between them.{{Stub}}\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"250\" position=\"center\" bordercolor=\"#323574\">\nSummer_Insulted.jpg|Summer upset\nSummer_Laugh.jpg|Summer laughing.\nSummer Wasp.jpg|\"That wasp on [[Dylan|your]] nose.\"\nSummer_Dolly.jpg|Summer with [[Dolly (101 Dalmatian Street)|Dolly]].\n</gallery>\n\n== Trivia ==\n\n* Summer is more exactly a blue border collie.\n*She has an southern accent.\n{{101 Dalmatians}}\n[[Category:Character stubs]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:101 Dalmatians characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:English characters]]"
