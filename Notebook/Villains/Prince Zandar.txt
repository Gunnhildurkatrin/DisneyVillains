He is the Prince of the desert Kingdom of [[Tangu]] and shown to be a close friend to [[Prince James]].\n==Trivia==\n*Given his appearance, Zandar may be a Prince from one of the Seven Deserts mentioned in the [[Aladdin (TV series)|''Aladdin'' TV series]].\n*Prince Zandar, being a best friend of James, is near him when he is not near Hildegard. They worked on their dragon costume and castle project together, for instance.\n*He appears to share James's obsession with cannons and explosions, as the castle they built for their project was basically a huge cannon.\n*Although Elephants are traditionally native to Africa, the Indian Subcontinent and South East Asia, he is shown to have a pet elephant, which is not native to the Middle East where Tangu appears to be located. However, it is possible that his parents imported the elephants from a neighbouring kingdom.\n*Zandar has almost never been seen without his turban, the sole exception being in the episode \"[[Baileywick's Day Off]]\" when he wears a red bandana. He even wears his turban over his hockey helmet as shown in \"[[Lord of the Rink]]\".\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\">\nPrince Zandar01.jpg\nSofia in Once Upon a Princess.png\nZandar&James02.png\nZandar&James03.png\nZandar&Hildegard.png\nHildegard Zandar&Clio01.png\nVlcsnap-2013-09-17-17h07m46s29.png\nI'll live my life or give my life for liberty (3).png\nSofia The First - Two to Tangu 4.jpg\nPrincess-Butterfly-23.png|James and Zandar dressed as a dragon\nJames and Zandar playing Pirates.jpg\n45.
