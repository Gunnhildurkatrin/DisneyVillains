She loves analyzing and examining everything. She\u2019s cool, clearheaded, and also has stellar style. Whether she is trying to create a new sparkly fabric or stardust eyeliner, Adora is dedicated to the science of fashion!''\n===Personality===\nIf there was one word to describe Adora, it would be logical. With a calm mind and laser focus, she analyses the world around her with facts and reason, the tools she uses to make it better. Adora <span>is also rather introverted and at her happiest when she can be alone, conducting chemistry experiments, creating cutting edge fashions, or a little of both! </span>Although a kind and polite girl, Adora's preference for cold, hard logic makes her aloof, unable to empathize, and annoyed when her peers think with their hearts instead of their heads.\n\n== Appearance ==\nAdora\u2019s theme color is sky blue. She is a slender teen girl with dark skin, blue eyes, lips, and hair held in a bun. Her outfit consists of a dark blue striped sweater under a long sky blue jacket with star patterns and jeans with a star belt. Her accessories consist of her star-charmed watch, a blue star necklace, and a blue side purse with a star design. \n\nOn Earth, Adora\u2019s appearance changes to look like a normal human. Her hair color changes to black with only a streak of sky blue. Her skin loses its sparkle, and her outfit changes to normal human clothes. The only item that remains the same is her star-charmed watch. \n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nAdora profile.jpeg\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n* Adora is named after [[wikipedia:Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]] (\u2652), the eleventh of the twelve astrological signs of the zodiac, which means the water bearer.\n* Adora was originally going to be named Aquamarine.\n\n{{Star Darlings}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Star Darlings characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]"
