He is established as a long-time rival of the protagonist, [[Philip Brainard|Professor Philip Brainard]], and often profited by stealing his ideas.\n\n==Role\u00a0in the film==\nWhen introduced, Wilson is very blunt in his approach and declares his intent to not only continue stealing from Brainard but also takes his fianc\u00e9e, [[Dr. Sara Jean Reynolds]], from him and make her his own (in effect, this means stealing even more from Brainard than he already has).\nHe is mean to Brainard because of his attraction of power, so that the High School where Brainard and Sara teach classes eventually gets under his command.\n\nHe eventually fails, after being hit multiple times by Sara and accidentally swallowing Flubber, making him feel\u00a0a lot of weird sensations throughout his inner body before he farts Flubber out and faints, exhausted.\n\nAfter this, Brainard saves the school;\u00a0meanwhile, Wilson and the others are arrested.\n\n{{Flubber}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Croft, Wilson}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Flubber characters]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Professors]]\n[[Category:Medfield characters]]"
