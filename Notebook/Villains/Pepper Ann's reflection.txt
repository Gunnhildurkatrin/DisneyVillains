She is the mirror counterpart of [[Pepper Ann Pearson]] who serves as her conscience.\n==Role==\nOn the show, whenever Pepper Ann is facing a moral dilemma or a tough situation, her reflection comes to life in her eyes and chats with her about the issue. She usually appears in anything reflective such as her bathroom mirror, a puddle, window panes, etc. Sometimes her reflection will appear in more physical forms such as a photo, a cloud, a plate of spaghetti and, at one point, clay mold.\n\nThe reflection has a habit of usually leaning towards the moral opposite of what Pepper Ann is thinking. If Pepper Ann is doing the wrong thing, the reflection will try to steer her in the right direction, but sometimes if she is considering doing the right thing, the reflection will urge her to give in to her selfish desires. Because of this, the reflection acts more as the personification of Pepper Ann second guessing herself.\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nPAreflection2.jpg|The reflection speaks to P.A. in [[Lydia Pearson|her mother]]'s body.\npepperann2.jpg\n</gallery>\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Pepper Ann}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Pepper Ann characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Alternate Forms]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]"
