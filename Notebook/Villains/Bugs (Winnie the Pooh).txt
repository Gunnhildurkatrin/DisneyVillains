They are six-legged, green with yellow underside caterpillar-like insects that appear in many episodes in ''[[The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]''.\n\n==History==\nLike the crows, these bugs are considered pests to [[Rabbit's garden]] as they try to eat all of his vegetables, especially when they are led by their cunning leader. Also, like the crows, Rabbit has made many vain attempts to get rid of them, but they usually outsmart him and are often driven away by somebody other than Rabbit, with the exception of him sending them away using [[Eeyore]]'s tail as a lure in \"[[Eeyore's Tail Tale]]\". They also appear in Rabbit's flashback in ''[[Winnie the Pooh: A Very Merry Pooh Year]]''.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The leader of the bugs, especially the clothes it wears, resembles [[Napoleon Bonaparte]].\n\n{{Winnie the Pooh}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Winnie the Pooh]]\n[[Category:Winnie the Pooh characters]]\n[[Category:Bugs]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]"
