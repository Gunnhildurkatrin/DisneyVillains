A little boy crazy, she is obsessed with clothes and shoes, and usually has \"problems\" with her wardrobe. She often gets into fights with her slightly younger brother, [[Luke Ross|Luke]], but they do get along sometimes.\n\n===Personality===\nEmma is a girly, sweet, and very fashionable teenage girl. although she is very silly and dorky, she tries hard. She also displays a little bit of sass in everything she does. Emma has a very good sisterly bond with her sister Zuri, but usually fights with [[Luke]] and occasionally Ravi. She is assumed to be a Directioner (someone who likes One Direction) because on a few occasions she brings up the band, either in random conversation, or a dream.\n\n===Physical appearance===\n[[File:Tumblr m3o4mr9t1M1qeewuqo1 500.png|thumb|200px|Emma in Season 1 of Jessie.]]\nEmma has long, blonde, straight hair and hazel eyes.
