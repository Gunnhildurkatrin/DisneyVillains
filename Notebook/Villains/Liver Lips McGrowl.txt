He plays the guitar and occasionally impersonates [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]].\n\nHe also appears in the parks as a [[Disney Parks characters|walk-around character]] along with fellow Country Bears [[Big Al]], [[Wendell]], and [[Shaker]].\n==Biography==\nFrom 1972's Country Bear Jamboree record album:\n\n''Liver-Lips McGrowl is a homebody who is never home. His career has spanned the entertainment world, and he is equally famous in radio, TV, night clubs and the circus. His throaty growl has captivated audiences everywhere, and he had played return engagements in such famous towns as Paris (Kentucky), Rome (Tennessee), Berlin (Wisconsin), Athens (Georgia), Cairo (Illinois), and Stuttgart (Arkansas). But his heart is always at home, where the Miami Serenader can guzzle home cookin\u2019 and catch up on his whittlin\u2019. He has whittled a rain barrel, a bathtub, a pig trough, and a sump pump.''\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nLiver_Lips_Concept_Art.png|Concept art for Liver Lips by [[Marc Davis]].\nLiver_Lips_Original_WDW.png|Liver Lips pre-2012 refurbishment.
