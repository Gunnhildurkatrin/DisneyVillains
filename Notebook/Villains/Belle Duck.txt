"[[File:Belle_Duck.jpg|thumb|250px]]\n'''Belle Duck''' is a fat, tall, and elegant duck lady created by [[Dick Kinney]] and Al Hubbard. She happens to be an old crush of Scrooge's, including she knows some secret of him and she uses this \"trump card\" to blackmail him when she needs his financial help to fix her riverboat, \"The Gilded Lily\". You can assume that Belle knows something really unconfessable about Scrooge's past, considering that he's a very, very stingy man and she can make him give money to her. Belle appeared in a couple of Brazilian comic stories and her last appearance was in the story \"[http://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=D+2006-288 Riverboat Rovers]\" by Lars Jensen.\n\n{{Wikipedia|List of Donald Duck characters}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Duck, Belle}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
