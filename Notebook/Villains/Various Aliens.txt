This would also extend to [[Leroy Clones|his clones]].\n**The eyes of a People Eating Puss\u00a0Monkey.\n***Also, the experiments that\u00a0have blank eyes (mainly Angel, [[627]], and Leroy) imply that the People Eating Puss\u00a0Monkey's template was also used in their creations.\n****[[Spooky]] even changed into a similar-looking creature several times.  \n**An alien with a lot of teeth.\n**A Bottom Feeding Scum Sucker, which is possibly where Stitch's appetite comes from and the possession of spikes on the back.\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Bounty hunters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]"
