At first, he treats James harshly, saying that he has gone through eight squires already, calling James \"little prince.\" However, after James learns from Tilly that his rough treatment is to help him get a taste of the toils of being a knight, James enjoys his job and is welcomed by Finnegan when the knights parade.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"180\" position=\"center\">\nThe-Silent-Knight-63.png\nThe-Silent-Knight-26.png\nThe-Silent-Knight-64.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Sofia the First}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Finnegan, Sir}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Knights]]\n[[Category:Sofia the First characters]]\n[[Category:Irish characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Horsemen]]\n[[Category:Teachers]]"
