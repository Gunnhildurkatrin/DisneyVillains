You see a dog. I see an animal that believes with every fiber of his being, every fiber, that the girl he loves is in mortal danger. I see a depth of motion on the face of that canine the likes of which has never captured on screen before. Never. Mindy From The Network. We jump through hoops to make sure Bolt believes everything is real. It's why we don't miss marks. It's why we don't reshoot. And it's why we most certainly do not let the dog see boom mikes!! Because, Mindy from the network, if the dog believes it, the audience believes it.|The Director's monologue about the Bolt TV show.}}\n\nThe '''Director''' is the tertiary\u00a0antagonist of\u00a0[[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s\u00a0[[2008]]\u00a0animated feature film,\u00a0''[[Bolt (film)|Bolt]]''. He is the director of the ''Bolt'' TV show and is determined to prevent Bolt from finding out that he is not really a super dog.\n\n==Role in the film==\nWhen reviewing footage of the latest take for an episode, he is dismayed when he discovers a boom mic in one shot, ranting that [[Bolt (character)|Bolt]] could have seen that. When [[Mindy Parker]] \"from the network\"\u00a0arrives, he discusses his vision of Bolt as a tool of expressing emotion, believing that if Bolt believes that everything he does is real, so does the audience. Mindy is more concerned with the rating points and complains that the show is too predictable. She warns him that if the show loses at least half a rating point, she will fire the show's entire crew, starting with the Director. In fear of being fired, the Director and the film crew decide to create a cliff-hanger episode to boost up the TV show's ratings, consequently leading to Bolt escaping from the trailer after believing that Calico captured Penny.\n\nDuring the fire, he and the camera crew barely escape the fire in the studio not sure if there was anyone else still inside. His ultimate fate is unknown, but it can be implied that he lost all of his audience after Penny was replaced with a new teenage actress and subsequently got fired.\n\n==Personality==\nThe Director is quite melodramatic and paranoid. He is also quite careless and greedy as he did not want [[Bolt (character)|Bolt]] to discover the truth about himself.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nBolt-disneyscreencaps com-1245.jpg\nBolt-disneyscreencaps com-1261.jpg\nBolt-disneyscreencaps com-1293.jpg\nBolt-disneyscreencaps com-2180.jpg\nBolt-disneyscreencaps com-2304.jpg\nBolt-disneyscreencaps com-2451.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Bolt}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Director, The}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Bolt characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]][\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]"
