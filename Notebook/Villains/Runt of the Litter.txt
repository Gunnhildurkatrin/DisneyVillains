Runt is easily frightened and prone to panic.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Chicken Little (film)|Chicken Little]]''===\nIn the film, Runt is [[Chicken Little (character)|Chicken Little]]'s close friend and one of Little's classmates at Mr. Woolensworth's class. He is later seen during a game of dodgeball when Little is having a conversation to Abby about his problem last year. Later when Little stands up against Foxy Loxy, Runt, Abby, and Fish prepare to save Chicken Little who only triggered a fire alarm in the gym. The next day during a game of baseball where Chicken Little signs up, Runt, Abby, and Fish train him to become a better player at baseball to beat the unbeatable player Foxy Loxy and later going on the field, Runt, Abby, and Fish are seen counting for him to win his first game in which he eventually does so.\n\nLater after a hexagonal object hits Little after being satisfied of his victory, Runt and Abby are later seen doing karaoke in which Little explains to him about his discovery about the hexagonal object that hit him as he, Fish, Abby, and Little discover what was going on in Oakey Oaks in which they plan to rescue Fish who interacted with the hexagonal object that hit Little. He, Abby and Little end up inside the UFO where they plan to rescue Fish to know when he is safe in high he is worried that the aliens are planning to take over Earth where Runt, Abby, Fish, and Little plan to escape. Runt almost tries to escape the UFO, but Abby tries to push him down due to his weight. The aliens try to close the hatch to get rid of him but are unable to due to Chicken Little holding the button as the heroes escape from the aliens.\n\nWhen the aliens plan to attack them, Runt is later seen eating corn whom Abby thinks he is an alien. Runt, Abby, and Fish work together to get Chicken Little up to the top of Oakey Oak Middle School in order to ring the bell to warn the citizens. Runt is later seen among the crowd of citizens where Chicken Little explains to the citizens about the discovery of aliens. Runt is later seen attempting to prove that Chicken Little was telling the truth when his mother scolds him about his nonsense (even threatening to take his Barbra Streisand collection despite his protests) as she takes him away with the citizens not understanding Little's discovery as the aliens send ground troops to rescue Kirby. Later when Chicken Little is moping, Little then explains that what he did is wrong again, even though he saw aliens invading Oakey Oaks. He, Abby, and Fish are suddenly frightened when they discover Kirby. Later when the aliens are invading Oakey Oaks, Runt, Abby, and Fish are later seen trying to get Buck's attention of Chicken Little telling the truth about his discovery. When Chicken Little and his father plan to bring Kirby back to his parents, Runt suddenly faints when Abby started blushing, thinking she is brainwashed by the aliens. Eventually, Runt, Fish, and Abby manage to rescue Buck and Little from the ground troops surrounding them as they plan to reunite Kirby with his parents.\n\nLater when the aliens restore Oakey Oaks back to normal, Runt is later seen mingling with Foxy who sings \"Lollipop\". At the end of the film, Runt and the citizens are watching a movie about Chicken Little where they saw a future version of Runt reply to the future version of Chicken Little about engaging the alien invasion: \"[[Ain't No Mountain High Enough|Ain't no mountain high enough, ain't no valley low...]]\" in which he and the other citizens like the movie they saw, making Chicken Little popular again. Despite the fact that his future self's ship take a hit for future Chicken Little's, Runt gleefully mouthes his counterpart's final words: \"Just give me some ammo, a little water, some chips if you have 'em.\" (which was very similar to what Runt himself said earlier), before whispering to Fish that \"This is amazingly accurate.\".\n\nRunt is later seen during the credits singing \"[[Don't Go Breaking My Heart]]\" dancing with [[Foxy Loxy (2005)|Foxy]].\n\n==Trivia==\n*During the scene where Fish Out of Water falls on the ground when pretending to be King Kong, Runt then says \"'Twas beauty that killed the beast\", an allusion to the classic fairytale and 1991 Disney film ''Beauty and the Beast''. This is also a famous line from the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Kong_(1933_film) 1933 adaptation of ''King Kong''], though misquoted.\n**Also during the scene where Chicken Little, Abby, Runt, and Fish discover Kirby before multiple aliens attack Oakey Oaks, Runt explains \"[[Darth Vader]] is [[Luke Skywalker|Luke]]'s father?\", making an allusion to Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, characters from the popular ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nchickenlittle139.jpg\nChicken-Little.jpg\nchicken-little-disneyscreencaps.com-8520.jpg\nvlcsnap-2015-09-30-20h36m06s872.png\nvlcsnap-2015-09-30-20h37m21s545.png\nvlcsnap-2015-09-30-21h00m42s057.png\nvlcsnap-2015-09-30-21h01m15s487.png\nvlcsnap-2015-09-30-21h02m15s345.png\nvlcsnap-2015-09-30-21h11m34s427.png\nvlcsnap-2015-09-30-21h09m01s332.png\nvlcsnap-2015-09-30-21h18m52s555.png\nvlcsnap-2015-09-30-21h26m07s710.png\nvlcsnap-2015-09-30-21h26m25s553.png\nvlcsnap-2015-09-30-21h26m32s383.png\nvlcsnap-2015-09-30-21h39m20s746.png\nvlcsnap-2015-09-30-21h39m58s628.png\nvlcsnap-2015-09-30-21h43m55s609.png\nvlcsnap-2015-09-30-21h44m27s594.png\nVlcsnap-2015-09-30-21h47m14s005.png\nvlcsnap-2015-09-30-21h49m05s808.png\nVlcsnap-2015-09-30-21h51m36s332.png\nvlcsnap-2015-10-01-08h35m39s735.png\nVlcsnap-2015-09-30-21h56m52s278.png\nvlcsnap-2015-10-01-08h29m15s544.png\nvlcsnap-2015-10-01-08h29m33s571.png\nvlcsnap-2015-10-01-10h45m48s233.png\nJuly1st.png|His page in [[Disneystrology]]\n</gallery>\n\n{{Chicken Little}}\n[[Category:Chicken Little characters]]\n[[Category:Pigs]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Tritagonists]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]"
