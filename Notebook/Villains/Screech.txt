He can fly, using a pair of wings he made to complete his look, but his real power is a high-pitched screech that can break glass.

Later after Elastigirl is captured and brainwashed by Evelyn Deavor, Screech and the other Supers break into the Parr family's new home under Evelyn's control and putting the Hypno-goggles on Frozone with Brick catching him. He and the other Supers are later seen fighting against Dash, Violet, and Jack-Jack on Winston's ship in which they confront them to remove their Hypno-goggles with help from Elastigirl, Mr. Incredible, and Frozone; Screech is suddenly saved when Dash tackles him while on deck and hits the Hypno-goggles and saving him from Evelyn's control.
