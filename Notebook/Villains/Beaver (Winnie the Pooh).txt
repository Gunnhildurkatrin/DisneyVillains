He is a relatively new character, introduced in the first season of ''[[My Friends Tigger & Pooh]]''. Beaver is often compared to [[Gopher (Winnie the Pooh)|Gopher]] from ''[[The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]'' series, as they are both hard-working rodents and are quite similar in appearance and personality. However, while Gopher is a little bit short-tempered, Beaver is clearly more easygoing.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Work is the only thing Beaver does.\n*He is very similar to [[Mr. Busy]] from ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]''.\n\n{{Winnie the Pooh}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Winnie the Pooh characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Beavers]]\n[[Category:My Friends Tigger and Pooh characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
