Nelly is shown to mean no harm to Daisy when seen smelling and admiring her perfume and shoes but Daisy runs away scared; only to bump into Gaylord and get herself captured.\n\nWhen Gaylord leaves to find some sweets, which literally bring fire into someone's belly, Nelly has tea with Daisy and admits she's a nice dragon but a bit of \"a sucker for gifts,\" which explains her alliance with Gaylord. When Gaylord returns, Nelly tries to stand up to him: \"I am my own dragon. I choose for myself!\" as suggested by Daisy; only to fall into serving Gaylord again when he offers her the sweets, which bring back her fire; much to Gaylord's joy. Daisy manages to escape as Nelly spins around excited to have her fire back.\n\nNelly is next seen setting the villages on fire as she makes her way to regrettably eliminate Donald. Luckily, with Daisy's help, Donald manages to save himself from being burned by offering Nelly her favorite: chocolates. Then, a gift-offering war ensues between Donald and Gaylord until Donald finally wins by offering Nelly the crown, since Donald is sick of being king, and Nelly likes the outfit, therefore, making Nelly the new queen of Quaintinia. When Gaylord furiously demands she torches Donald and calls her a nincompoop, Nelly finally turns against him and sends him running away in flames; never to be seen or heard from again.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"180\">\nnelly.jpg|Nelly in a flashback\nnelly1.jpg|Nelly defeated and her fire extinguished\nnelly2.jpg\nnelly3.jpg|Nelly having tea with [[Daisy Duck|Daisy]]\nLotQ6.jpg|Nelly's fire returned\nnelly4.jpg\nnelly5.jpg|Queen Nelly\nnelly6.jpg|Nelly turning on [[Prince Gaylord|Gaylord]]: \"That's Queen Nincompoop to you!\"\nNelly7.jpg|Nelly setting Gaylord on fire\n</gallery>\n==Trivia==\n*Her design is similar to [[The Reluctant Dragon (character)|The Reluctant Dragon]].\n{{Quack Pack}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Dragons]]\n[[Category:Quack Pack characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Queens]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]"
