(TV series)|W.I.T.C.H.]]. He is voiced by [[Paul Eiding]].\n\n==History==\nJeek is an evil passling and\u00a0Blunk's nemesis. A smuggler much like Blunk but has a tendency to make deals with the bad guys, as seen in season one when he steals the\u00a0Heart of Kandrakar\u00a0from\u00a0Will\u00a0to trade it with\u00a0Phobos\u00a0for money and in season two when he trades the Horn of Hypnos with\u00a0Raythor. Coincidentally, Blunk is blamed for the stealing of the Heart of Kandrakar. In season two he becomes a Trance Marcher after he sold the Horn of Hypnos to Raythor. Also like Blunk, Jeek hates getting wet and having a bath.\n\n==Episode Appearances==\n===Season One===\n*[[The Underwater Mines]]\n*[[The Stolen Heart]]\n\n===Season Two===\n*[[G is for Garbage]]\n*[[X is for Xanadu]]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nG is for Garbage (4).jpg\nG is for Garbage (5).jpg\nG is for Garbage (6).jpg\nG is for Garbage (7).jpg\nG is for Garbage (9).jpg\nG is for Garbage (10).jpg\nG is for Garbage (11).jpg\nUnderwater Mines (8).jpg\nUnderwater Mines (9).jpg\nUnderwater Mines (15).jpg\nUnderwater Mines (17).jpg\nUnderwater Mines (30).jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{W.I.T.C.H}}\n[[Category:W.I.T.C.H. characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Frogs]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Males]]"
