Paulson\u2019s role is the director of Level 7, a top-secret facility that makes Teamo's gadgets. He is an eccentric man who rarely ever loses his temper except when someone blows up Level 5. This is especially apparent when Crawford\u2019s attempts to add more power caused an explosion in Level 5, due to Paulson\u2019s anger.\n\nHe also has a soft spot for Teamo and is willing to help with any problems that they may have. For example, when Teamo were under the hypnotic effects of Hypnotheria whereby they could ate nothing but sweets, Paulson used a giant hand to snap them out of the spell. He was also forgiving of Skate Lad when he accidentally broke a wing off his skateboard. As a result, Paulson is an invaluable ally to Teamo Supremo and they have the upmost respect for him.\n\n{{Teamo Supremo}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Paulson, Mr.}}\n[[Category:Character stubs]]\n[[Category:Teamo Supremo characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]"
