Despite other chiefs being depicted as dogfaces, the Grand Mogul has a bill. A running gag about the character is that \"Mogul\" (or another one of his countless pompous titles) is an acronym with a different meaning each time. \n== Trivia ==\n* In the ''Junior Woodchucks'' comic ''Let Sleeping Bones Lie'' (written by [[Carl Barks]], published in ''[[Uncle Scrooge]]'' #358), the Grand Mogul's full name is given as Philodemus Gentlefogg.\n* While it is likely that the Grand Mogul is a Goose (due to his full name being specified as Bertie '''McGoose''' in Italian Disney comics), it is unknown to which species he belongs.\n**In Carl Barks' ''The Hound of the Whiskervilles'' (''Uncle Scrooge'' #29), Scrooge briefly refers to a group of clansmen as members of the \"Clan McGoose\". \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{CharacterStub}}\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Carl Barks]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Geese]]\n[[Category:DuckTales characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]"
