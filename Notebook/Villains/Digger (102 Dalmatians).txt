When [[Kevin Shepherd|Kevin]]\u00a0is introducing [[Chloe Simon|Chloe]] to the Dogs at Second Chance, he claims that Digger is banned from every park in London as a menace to roses. He is later seen with ''The Gang ''as they help rescue the puppies from [[Cruella De Vil]]. With the dalmatian puppies squirting colored icing on her as a baked cake, Digger uses the rainbow sprinkles to add insult to injury. He is not seen throughout the rest of the film. Presumably, he finds a new home.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery columns=\"1\">\nCruella dogs.jpg|Digger with [[Cruella De Vil]], [[Fluffy (102 Dalmatians)|Fluffy]], [[Drooler]] and [[Chomp]]\nDigger (Animated).gif|Digger (animated)\n102-dalmatians-disneyscreencaps.com-10244.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{101 Dalmatians}}\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:101 Dalmatians characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
