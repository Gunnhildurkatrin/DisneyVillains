They assist the centaurettes on dry land with their hair and makeup. They see the centaurs and help the centaurettes look their best to attract the attention of the centaurs. Each centaurette was able to find a centaur to mate with, and are shown doing various fun activities with their new beaus. Everything went as planned, but they notice [[Brudus]] sitting alone under a tree, as it seemed he hadn't yet found a mate. [[Melinda]] is also looking lonely without a [[Centaurs|centaur]] to mate with, so the cherubs have an idea: they decide to bring the two together. And they brought her together with Brudus. When\u00a0[[Zeus (Fantasia)|Zeus]] arrives, the cherubs huddle fearfully inside the pavilion. Then they come out of the pavilion when Zeus goes to sleep and when [[Iris]]\u00a0arrives, they along with the Fauns, the [[Pegasi Siblings]], and the [[Unicorns]] play in her rainbow, then one cherub goes to sleep with to fauns, Melinda, and Brudus under a tree after [[Morpheus (Fantasia)|Morpheus]]\u00a0arrives.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" position=\"center\">\nTumblr n3u5thJqEq1rxt9glo8 1280.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-9150.jpg\nfantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-9167.jpg\nfantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-9183.jpg\nfantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-9198.jpg\nfantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-9208.jpg\nfantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-9323.jpg\nfantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-9373.jpg\nfantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-10313.jpg\nfantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-10621.jpg\n1966-music-for-evybody-09.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cupid]]\n\n{{Fantasia}}\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Immortal]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Greek Mythology]]\n[[Category:Greek characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Fantasia characters]]\n[[Category:Angels]]\n[[Category:Matchmakers]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Who Framed Roger Rabbit cameos]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]"
