She first appeared in the [[1937]] theatrical short ''[[Don Donald]]''.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Daisy Donna.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Daisy (named Donna) in ''[[Walt Disney's Comics and Stories]]'' #1]]\nThe history of Daisy in animation can be traced to the appearance of her precursor Donna Duck in the cartoon short ''[[Don Donald]]'' (first released on [[January 9]], [[1937]]), directed by Ben Sharpsteen. The plot had Donald courting Donna somewhere in [[Mexico]]. Donald rides a donkey and lets Donna also ride it, but unfortunately, Donna hates the animal. Angered at blowing his chances with Donna, Donald trades in his burro for [[313|a flashy red car]]. Donna loves the car \u2013 until it breaks down in the middle of nowhere, and Donna drives away on her unicycle, leaving Donald.\n\n[[File:DonnaDuck_comic.jpg|thumb|left|Donna Duck with Daisy in a comic strip from 1951.]]\nThe short is important for introducing a romantic interest for Donald. But one should note that Donna had little in common with Daisy other than both being female ducks and sharing a temper. Donna was more or less a female version of Donald both in design and voice. Her voice was provided by [[Clarence Nash]] and was a slightly higher version of that of Donald (Daisy had the same voice in her official debut, ''[[Mr. Duck Steps Out]]''). Donna was not intended as a recurring character and the Donald shorts of the following three years featured no female companion for him.\n\nIn ''[[Walt Disney's Comics and Stories]]'' #1 (published in 1940), Daisy Duck is named Donna in an image that appears based on ''[[Mr. Duck Steps Out]]''. The image contains Donald and Daisy, with the text \"Donald's got a girl! \u2014and Donna thinks that HE'S just dandy. Because his heart is full of\u2014candy!\"\n\nDonna returned in [[Bob Karp]]'s Donald Duck daily strips from [[1951]], where she's a Mexican lady moving in as Donald's neighbor, causing Daisy to be jealous. This establishes the two as separate characters and marks the first time they appear together in a story.\n\n[[File:Donna-donald-2013.png|thumb|250px|left]]\nDonna reappeared in a [[2012]] comic by Lars Jensen and Carlos Mota, called ''Too Many Donalds''. In this story, Donna visits [[Duckburg]] together with her new boyfriend [[Whitewater Duck]], Donald's distant cousin.\n\nConfusingly, in spite of the above-mentioned comics showing Donna to be a separate character from Daisy, various other Disney products, such as the book ''[[Disney Dossiers: Files of Characters From the Walt Disney Studios]]'' and the ''Walt Disney Cartoon Classics: Starring Donald and Daisy'' VHS, refer to Donna and Daisy as being one and the same.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nTumblr n6gzs5Lhho1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\nTumblr_n8kjv2eEAR1r3jmn6o1_1280.png\nTumblr_n8kk6xWDGW1r3jmn6o1_1280.png\nTumblr n8kk9a9hOR1r3jmn6o2 1280.png\nTumblr n8kk9a9hOR1r3jmn6o1 500.png\nTumblr_n8kkc3dUyF1r3jmn6o1_1280.png\nTumblr_n9efkmD9NX1r3jmn6o1_1280.png\nTumblr n9efiesZ2E1r3jmn6o1 500.png\nTumblr n9efiesZ2E1r3jmn6o2 1280.png\nTumblr n9efiesZ2E1r3jmn6o3 1280.png\nTumblr_n9efm9zuGL1r3jmn6o1_1280.png\nDonald-Duck-Don-Donald-donald-duck-9562780-720-480.jpg\nDonald-Duck-Don-Donald-donald-duck-9562709-720-480.jpg\nDDon 0.jpg\nCcf2d02.jpg\nTumblr nasn3t1Kvp1qhcrb0o2 1280.jpg\nTumblr nasn3t1Kvp1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\ndonna leaves.png|Donna gets mad and leaves.\ndonna.png\nd1.png\nd3.png\nd4.png\ndonnaa.png\ndonnab.png\ndonnac.png\ndonnad.png\ndonnae.png\ndonnaf.png\ndonnag.png\ndonnah.png\ndonnai.png\n</gallery>\n{{Mickey Mouse & Friends}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Duck, Donna}}\n[[es:Donna Duck]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Dancers]]\n[[Category:Alternate Forms]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]"
