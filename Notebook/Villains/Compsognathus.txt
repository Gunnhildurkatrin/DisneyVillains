They have very minute sizes, long tails, and long heads and mouths.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Fantasia]]''===\nThe Compsognathus appear briefly in\u00a0''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' segment of ''Fantasia'' during the \"extinction\" scene as one of the many species crossing the desert, before the impending extinction of the dinosaurs.\n\n===[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]===\nSeveral Composognathus appeared in the [[Dinosaur (Disney's Animal Kingdom attraction)|DINOSAUR]] attraction. They are the last dinosaur species introduced on the ride. After the Time Rover ducks down to avoid hitting a swooping [[Cearadactylus]], the Composognathus were seen leaping past the vehicle and its passengers before it lost traction and ran into the [[Carnotaurus]] again. Originally the Composognathus were suspended on a chain that shows them physically flying over the guests. After the refurbishment promoting the release of ''[[Dinosaur]]'', the dinosaurs remained in place and were illuminated on to show them leaping. Recent refurbishment in [[2016]] replaced them completely with animated screens showing them jumping from ledge to ledge, before scurrying off into the night.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nfantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-6083.jpg\nDinosaur_Compsognathus.jpg\n25 species concept art for Disney Dinosaur.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Fantasia}}\n[[Category:Dinosaurs]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric animals]]\n[[Category:Fantasia characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Gravity Falls characters]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric characters]]"
