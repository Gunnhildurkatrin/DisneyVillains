While he means well, he has a rather long tongue, often speaking out of the right moment. This leads to the other servants, particularly [[Lumiere]] and [[Cogsworth]], to dislike him greatly. During the first segment of ''Belle's Magical World'', he infuriates the Beast by giving unwanted synonyms to [[Belle]]'s insults during a row, leading the Beast to strike him. Wracked with guilt after Belle and the Beast stop speaking to each other, he forges a letter of apology from Belle with his two best friends, [[Crane]]\u00a0(a set of paper sheets) and [[Le Plume]] (a quill). He is exiled from the castle when the Beast finds out, but amends are made after Belle brings him back.\n\n==Gallery\ufeff==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nWebster on Stand.jpg\nBelle-magical-world-disneyscreencaps.com-269.jpg\nBelle-magical-world-disneyscreencaps.com-2010.jpg\nBelle-magical-world-disneyscreencaps.com-1978.jpg\nBelle-magical-world-disneyscreencaps.com-1991.jpg\nBelle-magical-world-disneyscreencaps.com-1967.jpg\nBelle-magical-world-disneyscreencaps.com-1958.jpg\nBelle-magical-world-disneyscreencaps.com-1955.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Beauty and the Beast}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Beauty and the Beast characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Servants]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Books (fictional)]]\n[[Category:Magical Objects]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:French characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Authors]]"
