He is played by Cory Buck.\n\n==Role in the film==\nJason first appeared with his mother driving on the freeway, where he first caught a glimpse of [[Mighty Joe Young (character)|Mighty Joe Young]] the Giant Gorilla, not knowing who he was. \n\nLater on, after [[Jill Young]] and Joe defeated [[Andrei Strasser]], Jason appeared again on a Ferris wheel, but he was alone at the top (due to people running away from Joe, also due to him being a giant gorilla). So Joe was the only one to save him. Whenthey came down, Jason was alive and Joe was thought to be gone, but he later woke up and was revealed to be alive. Everyone else offered to help Joe, and a national wildlife park was opened, where Joe was safe forever.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-4853.jpg\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-4864.jpg\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-4875.jpg\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-10928.jpg\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-11739.jpg\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-11740.jpg\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-11833.jpg\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-11837.jpg\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-11838.jpg\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-11916.jpg\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-11987.jpg\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-11995.jpg\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-12008.jpg\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-12025.jpg\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-12029.jpg\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-12090.jpg\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-12110.jpg\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-12165.jpg\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-12170.jpg\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-12186.jpg\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-12195.jpg\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-12200.jpg\nMighty-joe-young-disneyscreencaps.com-12478.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Mighty Joe Young}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jason}}\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Mighty Joe Young characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]"
