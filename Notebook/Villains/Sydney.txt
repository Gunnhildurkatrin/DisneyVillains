When they first meet, Sydney embarrasses Raven by constantly insulting her. However, when Raven learns that Sydney is a foster child, they quickly develop a friendship. Sydney is an aspiring comedian, and she even \"performed\" at [[Cory Baxter|Cory]]'s \"bro mitzvah\" in the episode \"[[Raven, Sydney and the Man]]\". Raven and Sydney are now very close friends, and even enter a Little Miss and Her Big Sis pageant. Raven and Sydney are often compared as sisters, although they are not actually related. In the episode \"[[Rae of Sunshine]]\", Sydney has trouble making friends so she embarrasses Raven again, but then at the end, she makes friends without embarrassing Raven.{{CharacterStub}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nThat's So Raven - Raven.
