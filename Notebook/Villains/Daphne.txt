She comes to the Russo Home during Family Game Night. The game goes well until halfway through the games, when Jerry and Theresa fight about Alex cheating, and Daphne is spooked by their aggressive behavior and odd personality causing her to tell Justin to \"never bring a girl home!\" and then leave.\n\n==Appearances==\n*\"Family Game night\" (only appearance)\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Wizards of Waverly Place}}\n[[Category:Wizards of Waverly Place Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Students]]"
