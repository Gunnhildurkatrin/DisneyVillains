Then there was a second story in development where Moana only had six older brothers, one brother who tormented her and another who was wise and supportive. In this version, Moana was the best sailor among her brothers, but still overlooked by their father, [[Chief Tui]].\n\nMinkyu Lee gave the nine brothers distinct personalities, and to have their personalities reflected in the way they wear their lavalavas (the garments around their waist):<ref>\n{{Cite web|website=Tumblr|title=Moana Visual Development, Part 2|url=http://minkyuanim.tumblr.com/post/153708298573/moana-visual-development-part-2-the-brothers|author=Lee, Minkyu|date=November 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\n*'''Bro No.1''': The leader, most like his father.\n*'''Bro No.2''': The warrior.\n*'''Bro No.3''': The artist and dreamer, and who Moana feels closest to.\n*'''Bro No.4''': The easygoing lovable big guy.\n*'''Bro No.5 & 6''': Twins who were amazing at rowing in synchronicity.\n*'''Bro No.7''': The lady's man who was a great dancer.\n*'''Bro No.8''': The annoying loud one.\n*'''Bro No.9''': The aloof weird one.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Moana}}\n[[Category:Deleted characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Moana]]\n[[Category:Moana characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Sailors]]\n[[Category:Warriors]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
