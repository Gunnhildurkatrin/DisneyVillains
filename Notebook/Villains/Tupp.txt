However, he can become rude and grouchy when he's disturbed from sleep.\n\n==Role in the series==\n===''[[Journey of Memories]]''===\nTupp first appears telling Bunga to keep the noise level down after hearing Bunga stomping to which he does not realize he is making noise near his home. He then explains to Ono that he is in fact a jerboa to which he explains that like any other desert animal, he is nocturnal. Kion accidentally scares him for being rude to the Lion Guard as the jerboa retreats to which he then regrets his actions. Kion later explains that the Lion Guard can't stay out in the sun much longer due to the extreme heat in which Ono remembers what Tupp explained to him that most desert animals do not come out during the day and are more active at night to which the Lion Guard decides to build a shelter just like what a jerboa does.\n\nTupp later appears hopping towards Kion to which Kion apologizes for scaring him and introduces him to the Lion Guard. He then accepts Kion's apology and he also apologizes to Kion for being rude and unkind to visitors. Tupp introduces himself and explains that he is a not really a diurnal animal telling the group that he saw them taking his advice of escaping the intense heat. Tupp takes the group to get water for them to stay hydrated. Upon arriving to a large desert plant, Tupp explains that he does not drink much water himself, but travelers arriving in the desert must always drink water to stay refreshed. He tells the Guard that the plant's leaves collect water to which the Guard feels hydrated after getting water from the plant. Anga is then curious about how Tupp found it to which he explains that animals in the desert do not look down at the ground to find their way but instead, they look up at the sky to find their way. Looking at the sky, Makini explains that the stars she saw at the sky are like a field of flowers, just like the flowers at the moja kwa moja stone leading to the next landmark the Guard saw earlier. Tupp explains that the stars in a form of a diamond always stay in the same place in the sky to which he explains that the stars lead to the path across the desert to the tall cliffs to which the Guard decides to follow the path to the cliff.\n\n==Relationships==\n\n===Friends===\n====[[Kion]]====\nTupp and Kion are on good terms. After Tupp wakes up from his nap, he blamed it on the Lion Guard for causing disturbance. Tupp rudely kicked sand in Kion's eyes to which he did get mad at him and even growled at the jerboa, to which he ran away after that. At night, Tupp apologized for his harshness towards Kion and showed the Lion Guard where to find water.\n\n====[[Bunga]], [[Fuli]], [[Beshte]], [[Ono]], and [[Anga]]====\nTupp is on good terms with all of the members of the Lion Guard. However, he didn't like it when they woke him up from his nap. This is due to the fact the jerboas like Tupp are nocturnal.\n\n====[[Makini]]====\nTupp and Makini are on good terms. He even helped the mandrill find water to wash the sand off of the Tuliza she has in her gourd because Kion dislikes consuming Tuliza with sand on it.\n\n==Trivia==\n*His name is Swedish for \"rooster\", even though he stated that he's not a morning person.\n\n{{The Lion King}}\n[[Category:The Lion Guard characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Mice]]\n[[Category:Asian characters]]"
