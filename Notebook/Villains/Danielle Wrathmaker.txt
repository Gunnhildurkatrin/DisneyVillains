"{{Infobox character\n|image=Danielle Wrathmaker.png|shows=[[Goof Troop]]|voice=[[April Winchell]]|occupation=News reporter|affiliations=Spoonerville News|home=[[Spoonerville]]|likes=Personal space|dislikes=Sexist men}}\n'''Danielle Wrathmaker''' is a news reporter for Spoonerville News from [[Disney Television Animation|Disney's]] 1992-1993 animated series, ''[[Goof Troop]].''\n==Background==\nShe gives news reports in various episodes as part of Spoonerville News. Danielle has reported on a number of different things, such as aliens in \"[[Close Encounters of the Weird Mime]]\", a monster in \"[[All the Goof That's Fit to Print]]\", an attempted mob hit thwarted by [[Goofy]] and [[Pete]] in \"[[Goof Fellas]]\", and a crime scene involving [[Pete]] in \"[[The Good, the Bad and the Goofy]]\".\n\n==Personality==\nDanielle appears to cherish her personal space, as seen in \"[[Close Encounters of the Weird Mime]]\", where she is seen knocking out a citizen trying to get a closer look at her. However, she is a very serious, yet calm, reporter who takes her job seriously.\n\n==Physical Appearance==\nDanielle is a slender, average height, anthropomorphic dog with orange hair and bangs, put up in a bun. She wears a formal red jacket and matching red pencil skirt, white collared shirt, and black high-heeled shoes.\n\n==Role in the series==\nShe makes her debut in \"''[[Close Encounters of the Weird Mime]]''\" where she gives a report on a supposed alien sighting (which was actually [[Goofy]]). She shows a photograph apparently taken by NASA. An unnamed citizen inches his way into the camera view, resulting in him getting bashed on the head by Danielle. \n\nHer next appearance is in \"''[[All the Goof That's Fit to Print]]''\". She makes a report based on a fake story created by [[Max Goof]] and [[P.J.]] that [[Pete]] is a mutant alien who sells used cars.\n\nShe also appears in \"''[[Goof Fellas]]''\" interviewing Goofy and Pete after they inadvertently stop a mob hit.\n\nHer final appearance is in \"''[[The Good, the Bad and the Goofy]]''\", where she does a report about a robber kidnapping, where Pete is the victim. However, the police mistake Pete for a criminal kingpin.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the episode \"[[E=MC Goof]]\" Danielle's animation model is recycled and recolored for a different TV news reporter named Sandee Seznee (voiced by Diane Pershing).  Sandee has dark brown hair, yellow-framed glasses with clear lenses, and a bright red suit, in contrast to Danielle's orange hair, black-framed glasses with pink-tinted lenses, and either a maroon or light pink suit.\n*In the episode \"[[Window Pains]]\", the Sandee Seznee version of Danielle's animation model is used for a news reporter also voiced by April Winchell (using the same voice she uses for Danielle), but is not identified by name as either Danielle or Sandee.\n\n{{Goof Troop}}\n[[Category:Goof Troop characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:News Reporters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]"
