He gets along very well with his fellow farm animals, though [[Jeb]]'s grumpy and pessimistic personality makes it rather difficult. He has a tendency to look worried, due to his facial expressions, but isn't one to throw in the towel when all seems lost. He also loves and cares for his [[piggies]], and allows them to play and have fun. Last of all, he has an unnamed wife who is the piggies' mother.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Home on the Range]]''===\nOllie is first seen during the \"[[Little Patch of Heaven]]\" music number helping [[Pearl Gesner|Pearl]] with her chores around the [[Little Patch of Heaven (farm)|farm]]. Ollie is later present when [[Maggie]] first arrives on the\u00a0farm and stares at her in awe and wonder, as do the other farm animals, before she is welcomed by [[Mrs. Calloway]].\n\nLater, when [[Pearl Gesner|Pearl]]'s livestock face losing their\u00a0farm due to a bank notice that she hasn't been able to pay yet, Ollie and the other farm animals become distraught. Meanwhile, Maggie, Mrs. Calloway, and [[Grace]] go on a quest to capture outlaw [[Alameda Slim]] and use the reward money to save Little Patch of Heaven.\n\nAfter some time passes, even Ollie starts to worry about the cows. When [[Audrey (Home on the Range)|Audrey]] thinks the cows abandoned them and will never return, Ollie manages to calm her and the other farm animals down by shouting to get their attention. He then tries to lighten things up by telling Audrey and Jeb how Grace and Mrs. Calloway helped them both out when they were in trouble. He concludes by stating that there's nothing those cows can't do.\n\nIn the film's climax, Ollie helps the three cows (who have returned from their journey) battle a disguised Alameda Slim after he attempts to kill the bovines and gets the three piggies to lend a helping hoof. Ollie and the farm animals succeed in defeating Slim, who is then arrested by [[Sheriff Sam Brown]]. After Pearl uses the reward money to pay the bank's debt for Little Patch of Heaven, a photographer takes a picture of Pearl and her livestock, with Ollie and\u00a0everyone else smiling save Jeb.\n\nOllie is last seen dancing with all the other farm animals as they celebrate Pearl's farm being saved and re-opened.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nOllie.png\nClippig21.gif\nClippiggy.gif|Ollie with [[Pearl Gesner|Pearl]]\nClipcows21.gif\npig.jpg\n23944-28214.gif\nchar_53706.jpg\nnormal DisneyEnchantedPDVD_105.jpg\nNormal DisneyEnchantedPDVD 114.jpg\nHome-on-the-range-disneyscreencaps com-1127.jpg\nNormal DisneyEnchantedPDVD 124.jpg\nHome-on-the-range-disneyscreencaps com-5142.jpg|Ollie and the others looking at the cows' empty stables.\nPearl's animals screaming upon seeing the off-rail train.jpg|Ollie the others screaming in horror upon seeing an off-rail train crashing towards the farm.\nHome-on-the-range-disneyscreencaps com-7998.jpg|Ollie and the farm animals cheering after Pearl's farm is saved.\nPearlandFarmAnimals.jpg\nHome-on-the-range-disneyscreencaps com-8312.jpg\nTlp01.jpg\nTlp02.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Home on the Range}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Home on the Range characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Pigs]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Farm animals]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]"
