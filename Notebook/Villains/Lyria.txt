She tells magical tales at Fairy Tale Theater, which she brings to life by creating moving illustrations out of pixie dust.\n\nWhenever a show happens, many gather around. [[Fairy Mary]] is especially a big fan - she never misses a performance.\n\nAfter a long show, Lyria drinks special tea to clear her voice. Even though she's brave on stage, she can be quite shy with her friends. Her greatest wish is to travel to the mainland and see a human play. Only her closest friends know this.\n\n==''Tinker Bell'' Movies==\nIn ''[[Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure]]'', she [[Fairy Tale Theatre|tells the story]] of the [[Mirror of Incanta]], which inspired [[Tinker Bell]] to go find it and make a wish.\n\nLyria later makes non-speaking cameo appearances in the television special\u00a0''[[Pixie Hollow Games]]'' and in ''[[The Pirate Fairy]]'', cheering in the crowd.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Out of all of the characters in the\u00a0Tinker Bell movie series, Lyria one of only two\u00a0fairies to sing a song onscreen. The other is [[Fawn]], who sings \"[[Fawn's Animal Group Song]]\" in the short film \"Tink'n About Animals\".\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\n01c66e4c12ca0a632f38addbe98511fc.jpg\nLyria2.png\ntinkerbell-lost-treasure-disneyscreencaps.com-3102.jpg\ntinkerbell-lost-treasure-disneyscreencaps.com-3131.jpg\ntinkerbell-lost-treasure-disneyscreencaps.com-3136.jpg\ntinkerbell-lost-treasure-disneyscreencaps.com-3157.jpg\ntinkerbell-lost-treasure-disneyscreencaps.com-3159.jpg\ntinkerbell-lost-treasure-disneyscreencaps.com-3170.jpg\ntinkerbell-lost-treasure-disneyscreencaps.com-3212.jpg\ntinkerbell-lost-treasure-disneyscreencaps.com-3245.jpg\ntinkerbell-lost-treasure-disneyscreencaps.com-3288.jpg\ntinkerbell-lost-treasure-disneyscreencaps.com-3329.jpg\ntinkerbell-lost-treasure-disneyscreencaps.com-3373.jpg\ntinkerbell-lost-treasure-disneyscreencaps.com-3433.jpg\ntinkerbell-lost-treasure-disneyscreencaps.com-3439.jpg\ntinkerbell-lost-treasure-disneyscreencaps.com-3449.jpg\nBobble, Ivy, Terence, Fairy Gary, Glimmer &amp; Lyria in The Pirate Fairy.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Disney Fairies}}\n\n[[ru:\u041b\u0438\u0440\u0438\u044f]]\n[[Category:Fairies]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Disney Fairies characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]"
