It's ''amazing'' what you can find in the woods! A marble. And a boot. And oh, my, that's a ''scary'' lookin' fella.|The Backson's introduction}}\n\nThe '''Backson''' is an imaginary creature created by A.A. Milne as a part of the Winnie the Pooh stories and the false main antagonist of Disney's\u00a0[[2011]] [[Winnie the Pooh (film)|''Winnie the Pooh'' film]].\n\n==Background==\nThe Backson was first introduced in ''The House at Pooh Corner''. In the original story \"In Which Rabbit has a Busy Day and We Learn What Christopher Robin Does in the Mornings,\" [[Rabbit]] finds a note from [[Christopher Robin]]\u00a0similar to what [[Winnie the Pooh|Pooh]]\u00a0finds in the film and asks the others if they have spotted a herbaceous or spotted Backson until another note from Christopher Robin is found with better spelling. In the film, it is turned into a hunt for the Backson and setting a hole trap for him inspired by \"In which Piglet Meets a Heffalump.\"\n\nThe Backson was animated by [[Eric Goldberg]] for the film, with the song going for a simplistic chalk drawing form.\n\n===Personality===\nAccording to [[Owl]], the Backson is described as a mean, vicious creature that tries to catch [[Winnie the Pooh|Pooh]] and his friends in Owl's thoughts and thrives in messiness and chaos, being responsible for all of their misfortunes.\n\nDespite this, the real Backson does not show any vicious personality as he is not seen throughout the film until the post-credits scene where he is getting\u00a0the bait supposed to lure him to his trap. He\u00a0is shown in a kind, folksy\u00a0personality that thrives in generosity and discovery.\n\nThough never stated, it is possible that the Backson desires to make friends and has never experienced friendship and love.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nThe Backson is a large purple bull-like monster with red stripes, a blue furry coat, and red hair covering his eyes.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Winnie the Pooh (film)|Winnie the Pooh]]''===\nOne day, [[Winnie the Pooh|Pooh]]\u00a0finds a note, but\u00a0he could not tell what it was. He visits\u00a0[[Owl]] to figure it out, to which\u00a0Owl claims [[Christopher Robin]] has been kidnapped by a creature called\u00a0the Backson. Pooh and his friends have no clue what it is,\u00a0so Owl informs them of their new enemy \u2013 the Backson\u00a0is supposedly a ferocious creature that enjoys torturing others and creating misfortune; he is responsible for scribbling in their books,\u00a0holes in socks, chipped teeth,\u00a0theft, catching colds, aging, etc.\u00a0Pooh and his friends set off on a mission to rescue Christopher Robin before it is too late.\n\nRabbit conducts a plan to defeat the Backson: Gather material that the Backson enjoys destroying, dig an enormous pit,\u00a0and make the items lead to it. The Backson will follow the items\u00a0and eventually fall into the pit himself,\u00a0saving Christopher and defeating the beast. While Pooh, [[Piglet]], [[Rabbit]], Owl, [[Kanga]],\u00a0and [[Roo]] gather the material and set the trap, [[Tigger]] and [[Eeyore]] train to battle the Backson if necessary.\n\nSoon enough,\u00a0Pooh and his friends get trapped in the pit,\u00a0but escape using the text. After getting\u00a0out,\u00a0they reunite with Christopher Robin and tell him about the Backson. However, he clarifies by saying that he meant to be \"back soon\". Finally,\u00a0everything is straightened out.\n\nAfter the credits roll,\u00a0the Backson comes out of the scary woods and proves to be real,\u00a0but instead of being a monstrous beast, he is actually very kind. Upon seeing the bait Pooh and the others\u00a0left for him,\u00a0he decides to pick them up to return them, stating he does not want them to get broken.\u00a0However, he ends up falling into the pit as originally planned. After realizing he is in a pit, the Backson calls out for help. However, he then decides to wait for someone to help him out and hopes he will be back soon.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n* The Backson has a recurring theme song, which is reminiscent of a horror film suspense cue.\n* Despite [[Owl]]'s thoughts on the Backson, it can be implied that Owl spotted him before and\u00a0assumed he was a villain, even though he was not for real.\n* Even though [[Rabbit]]\u00a0often had somewhat\u00a0antagonistic roles, the Backson is the first main solo villain in the franchise,\u00a0despite the post-credits scene revealing his true harmless colors. [[Heffalumps]] and [[Woozles]]\u00a0and [[The Bees|bees]]\u00a0are villains in a group.\n* The Backson may not know what he looks like. This is evident\u00a0by his comment on the chalkboard of his image that it is a \"scary lookin' fella.\" The reason for this is probably because he does not own a mirror in the woods to see his reflection.\n* The Backson's phrases and mannerisms are based on his original voice actor Huell Howser.\n* He was mentioned in ''[[Disney Magic Kingdoms]]''.\n* The Backson was Howser's first and only film role before his death in 2013.\n\n{{Winnie the Pooh}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Backson, The}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Winnie the Pooh characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
