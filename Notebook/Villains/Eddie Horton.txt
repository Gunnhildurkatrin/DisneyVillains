He is a 13-year-old earthling, deuteragonist of [[Lloyd in Space|the series]] and [[Lloyd Nebulon|Lloyd]]'s best friend.\n\n==Biography==\n===Childhood===\nEddie was born sometime in the year X14 to [[Frank Horton]] and [[Mrs. Horton]]. He attended Woxagon Elementary school in the year X21. During first grade, he was one of three kids who did not make fun of Lloyd after he made a fool of himself in front of everyone. Instead he offered Lloyd to sit beside him, starting their long time friendship. It was also where he met [[Douglas McNoggin|Douglas]] and [[Kurt Blobberts|Kurt]], his other two best friends.\n\nDuring his childhood Eddie was also intrigued about his father's police work and would often ask him about it, to which his father would always say \"Aw son, police work is serious work. It ain't for kids.\"\n\n===Personality===\nEddie has been known to be sarcastic, witty and by far the most charismatic of the group. He often causes peer pressure among his friends and is a bad influence on them. Eddie almost never learns from his mistakes and can be unapologetic or remorseless. Despite this, it has been shown that Lloyd develops Eddie's personality as, without him, Eddie is brought down to a loner and a dork, more so than before. Eddie also hates to be called Edward. Eddie is also the only one in the group who isn't afraid to stand up to the more popular kids, even when outnumbered or outmatched (though it doesn\u2019t end well for him).\n\n==Physical Appearance==\nEddie is a tall 13-year-old human with short, wavy orange hair with yellow streaks, and pale Caucasian skin. He wears a blue long sleeve shirt, black shoes, red pants, and a puffy vest.\n\n==Quotes==\n*(To Lloyd after being called Edward)?\u00a0''\"Edward? Why I oughta...\"''\n*(To Kurt and Lloyd)?\u00a0''\"You two are pathetic.\"''\n*(To Douglas)?\u00a0''\"No skullus but I see a few new wrinkles.\"''\n*(To Brittany and the girls) \"''Stop right there, you treacherous vixens.''\"\n\n==Trivia==\n\n* Even though Eddie does not like being called \"Edward\", he seems to be okay with Douglas calling him that.\u00a0\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink|Eddie Horton}}\n==References==\n<references />\n{{Lloyd in Space}}\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Lloyd in Space characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]"
