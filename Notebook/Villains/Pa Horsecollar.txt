Pa tells his son that he should stand up up for himself, but, although he can be boastful and have a big mouth, Pa is often quite easily intimidated himself and tries to avoid conflict, and, as such, he is usually \"all talk and no action\". He enjoys watching boxing matches on TV.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nCow family.JPG\nHorace father 2.GIF\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Horses]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
