"[[File:Winnie_from_Fish_Flakes.png|thumb]]'''Winnie Grouper''' is an orange-haired cheerleader at [[Freshwater High]] in the show ''[[Fish Hooks]]''. Winnie is credited as \"Girl in crowd\" in \"[[Milo's Big Idea]]\" and as \"Cheerleader\" in \"[[Fish Talent Show]]\". Later, her name was revealed in the opening credits of \"[[Fish Lips Sink Ships]]\". She is voiced by [[Chelsea Kane]] in \"[[Oscar Makes an Impression]]\" but usually, [[Kari Wahlgren]] voices her.\n\n==Personal life==\nWinnie was one of Randy's customers when he produced his version of the Fridge Hat. She bought a \"Better Fridge Hat\", and when the \"Better Fridge Hat Minis\" were introduced, she was very excited. She took off the Better Fridge Hat, but one of the consequences of leaving it on too long was that the hair stuck to the bottom of it. Winnie screamed when she realized her hair was stuck to the Fridge Hat. She bought an Emergency Rainbow Afro of Love to cover her bald head (\"[[Milo's Big Idea]]\"). She was dressed up as a peasant for the play (\"[[Fish School Musical]]\"). When the feud between [[Clamantha]] and [[Shellsea]] started, Winnie paid for a \"Team Clamantha\" shirt (\"[[Fish Talent Show]]\"). When the news about Mr. Baldwin's crush on Ms. Lips circulated, Winnie told her friends that she heard that Baldwin had been obsessed with Ms. Lips since 1986 (\"[[Fish Lips Sink Ships]]\"). She attended an emergency meeting with Tabitha to discuss who would be on that year's Freshwater Catch of the Month Dude Edition Calendar (\"[[Fish Flakes]]\").\n\n==Physical ppearance==\nWinnie is a yellow goldfish with orange fish lips, orange hair and a Freshwater High Cheerleader uniform.\n\n==Background information==\n*Winnie was only 16 years old, but as of 2012, she is 17.\n*She was voiced by [[Kari Wahlgren]] in her high-pitched voice, but when she's voiced by [[Chelsea Kane]], her voice is different.\n\n==Appearances==\n*\"[[Doris Flores Gorgeous]]\" (First appearance) (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Underwater Boy]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Queen Bea]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Milo Gets a Ninja]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Dollars and Fish]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Parasite Fright]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Milo's Big Idea]]\"\n*\"[[Diary of a Lost Fish]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[We've Got Fish Spirit]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Oscar Makes an Impression]]\"\n*\"[[Fish School Musical]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Fish Talent Show]]\"\n*\"[[Hairanoid]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Adventures in Fish-Sitting]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Banned Band]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Milo on the Lam]]\"\n*\"[[Just One of the Fish]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Oscar's Secret Admirer]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[So-fish-ticated]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Milo's Magical Shake]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Principal Bea]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Fish Lips Sink Ships]]\"\n*\"[[Fuddy Duddy Study Buddy]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Fish Flakes]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Grouper, Winnie}}\n[[Category:Fish Hooks characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Cheerleaders]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Fish]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
