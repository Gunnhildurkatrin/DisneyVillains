Somebody's got to stand tall.|John to [[Polly Henry|Polly]]}}\n'''John Henry''' is one of the legends in ''[[American Legends]]''. He is also the protagonist from the [[John Henry|short film of the same name]], which can be seen on Disney's American Legends (2001).\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[John Henry]]''===\nAccording to legend, he was born with a hammer in his hand. He and some other freed slaves are building the railroad until a man\u00a0with a machine comes along claiming\u00a0the machine\u00a0can drive more railroad spikes. When the driver burns up the contract in the machine's furnace, John stops the enraged workers from toppling the machine. Instead, he makes the driver a wager: if John beats the machine in constructing the railroad by sundown, the promised land would be given to the workers. He wields two sledgehammers to do double the work.\u00a0They end up tunneling through a mountain. John prevails the challenge, but suddenly collapses from experiencing too much pressure while racing the steam drill. As Polly rushes to husband, she hands John his sledgehammer just as he lets out his last breath. Thus John died with a hammer in his hand just like he vowed, but knew that his legacy should continue to live on.\n\n== Disney Parks ==\n\n=== [[Pecos Bill Tall Tale Inn & Cafe]] ===\nJohn Henry's hammer and nails are on display in this inn dedicated to American legendary characters.
