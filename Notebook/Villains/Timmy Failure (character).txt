He is a young 11 year old boy who lives with his single mother in [[Portland]], [[Oregon]]. Together with his imaginary polar bear sidekick Total and his two classmate friends Charles \"Rollo\" Tookus and Molly Moskins, Timmy travels around the City of Roses trying to outwit \"the Russians\" and solve cases that he feels are more complicated than what they actually are. His biggest concern is finding a better office and making sure that the city of Portland is safe from villainy.\n\n==Background==\n\n=== Personality ===\nTimmy is a rather precocious child. He is shown to be very much aware of adult matters. While observant, he is has a habit of missing obvious answers to some of his cases. It is unknown if his ideas are delusional or just play pretend, but he does seem smart enough to acknowledge when his plans have gone too far. While he believes that his cases are for the good of the people of Portland, how he goes about \"solving\" them shows that he wants to achieve \"greatness\". He sometimes puts aside other people's concerns for his own benefit, but by the end of the movie, is told that he must learn from his mistakes.\n\n=== Relationships ===\nThe only person Timmy has to truly look out for is his mother Patty. Because of the lack of father figures, Timmy believes it is his duty to look after her. He constantly tells her that she would not have to worry about money \"soon\" because his detective agency will take off one day.\n\nIt is heavily implied that Total, his imaginary polar bear friend, is the result of his father walking out on him and his mother as Total \"arrives\" almost as soon as his father leaves the house for good. He makes him a \"partner\" in his \"successful\" detective agency Total Failure Inc. which he admittedly regrets because, as it turns out, polar bears are unreliable.\n\nOutside his mother, Timmy interacts with his friend and former member of Total Failure Inc. Charles \"Rollo\" Tookus who acts almost as a straight man to Timmy's many outlandish schemes. He also occasionally hangs out with Molly Moskins, a girl who openly admires him. However, he views her as being \"problematic\" because she is always happy.\n\nTimmy considers his arch-nemesis to be a girl named Corrina Corrina who for a while he called \"The Nameless One\". The reason for his hatred of her is never directly stated, but it is implied to be a couple of things. For one thing, he seemed nervous when Flo the librarian asked if he liked her and secondly, he recognizes that she has a very good relationship with her father, something that he clearly envies. Contrary to his claim of Corrina being evil, she is shown to be a genuinely nice girl who is kind to Timmy.\n\n==Trivia==\n* In the original book, Timmy was much more vain and egotistical; going so far as to call Rollo an idiot for stating the obvious and believing that the only reason kids do not hang out with him despite being \"popular\" is because they are afraid of Total.\n* Timmy's hair in the book is illustrated as being unkempt, but in the movie his hair seems matted down.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Detectives]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Students]]"
