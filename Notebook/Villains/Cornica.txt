She appeared in the episode \"[[Izzy and the Sea-Unicorn]]\".\n\n== History ==\nCornica met up with [[Izzy]] while she was sitting at the water's edge. She quickly bonded with Izzy and gave her a seashell to summon her. In return, Izzy gave Cornica a seashell necklace as a token of their friendship.\n\nWhen [[Captain Hook]] captured Cornica, Izzy set off for\u00a0[[Mermaid Lagoon (Neverland)|Mermaid Lagoon]] to ask if anyone had seen the sea unicorn. However,\u00a0[[Queen Coralie]] and her subjects discounted it, since sea unicorns are but legends in mermaid lore. [[Stormy]] was the only one who believed Izzy's story and helped the young pirates find where Hook had taken Cornica.\n\nJake and his crew pursued Hook in their min-subs to Coral Tunnel, wherein lay the legendary treasure of the sea unicorns. Hook caused a cave-in to try and stop Jake from following, but Jake and friends managed to bypass the cave-in.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nIzzy&Cornica-Izzy and The Sea-Unicorn.jpg\nHook&amp;Cornica-'Izzy_and_The_Sea-Unicorn.png\n398484.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Jake and the Never Land Pirates}}\n[[Category:Jake and the Never Land Pirates characters]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Marine Animals]]\n[[Category:Seahorses]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Mystical animals]]\n[[Category:Females]]"
