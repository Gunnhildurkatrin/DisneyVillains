When a flock of blue-footed boobie birds flies over the island, a female named Crystal ends up gaining the ability to speak by the Tiki Room's magic. She is attracted to Pierre's plumage and falls in love with him, and Pierre ends up developing his own crush on her. But when she finds that her flock is frightened by her newfound ability to speak, Crystal asks for the enchantment to be undone. Taking part in a ritual with the Tiki Gods to remove the gift, Crystal has one last moment with Pierre as the magic wears off and he tries proposing to her, though she insists as a migrating bird that she cannot stay.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nRSCN7075.JPG|Pierre with [[Jos\u00e9]], [[Fritz]], and [[Michael]] in ''[[It's a Small World: The Animated Series]]''.\nTIKIROOM2016004-GrandtConnectingVariant.jpg|[[Disney Kingdoms: Enchanted Tiki Room]] variant cover.\nTiki birds Card.jpg|Pierre with Michael, Fritz, and Jos\u00e9 on a Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom Christmas promo card.\nPierre TETRUNM.jpg|Pierre in ''[[The Enchanted Tiki Room (Under New Management)]]''.\n</gallery>\n\n{{Enchanted Tiki Room}}\n{{Disney Kingdoms}}\n\n==See also==\nOther characters in Disney sharing this name include:\n*[[Pierre, the Waiter]]\n*Belle's pet pig in the story \"Bothered\" from ''[[The New Adventures of Beauty and the Beast]]''\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Parrots]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:French characters]]\n[[Category:Kinect Disneyland Adventures characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Enchanted Tiki Room characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Infinity characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Kingdoms characters]]\n[[Category:Tales from Adventureland characters]]\n[[Category:Spell Cards characters]]\n[[Category:Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom Characters]]"
