She came on a visit in \"Three's Not Company\". She brought [[Sonny Munroe|Sonny]] a meatball sandwich from her favorite sandwich shop ''Zidel's'' back in Wisconsin. After arriving at Hollywood, she met [[Tawni Hart]] and was starstruck. Lucy decided to hang out with both Tawni and Sonny instead of doing what Sonny's fun-genda had planned for the two of them. Sonny told Lucy that Tawni acts like a queen but Lucy firsts acts like Tawni is one.</p>\n\n<p style=\"line-height:21px;\">[[Chad Dylan Cooper|Chad]] told Lucy and Sonny to come to his party, and after Chad was gone, Lucy asked Sonny if they could go to Chad's party. However, Sonny lied just so she could spend more time with her. That same night Sonny and Lucy were doing blindfolded make-overs when Tawni came in looking all pretty and ready to go to Chad's party. When Lucy realized that Sonny lied, she got mad at Sonny and Sonny is left alone as Tawni takes Lucy to the party. Later, at the party, Sonny apologizes to her and explains that she missed her so much and she just wanted to have her all to herself. Lucy forgives Sonny for lying and hugs her, knocking over a cardboard cut-out of Chad. The knocking over the cardboard cut-out then causes a chain reaction which results in Chad falling into his birthday cake. At the end she forgives her, and three girls ate cake off Chad's face.</p>\n\n<p style=\"line-height:21px;\">Lucy is originally from Oakland, [[California]].</p>\n\n<p style=\"line-height:21px;\">She returned in the sequel \"Lucy Comes Back\".</p>\n[[Category:Sonny with a Chance Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
