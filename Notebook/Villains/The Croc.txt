The crocodile looks very similar to the American Crocs, [[Brutus and Nero the Crocodiles|Brutus and Nero]], from the film ''[[The Rescuers]]''.\n\n==Role in the series==\nThe Croc appears as a main threat to the cubs in the episode \"How the Panther Lost His Roar.\" After [[Baloo]] and the other cubs fail to get [[Bagheera]]'s voice back, they head to the river for a swim. Bagheera declines his friends' offer and stays behind. Sometime later, the Croc shows up in the river while [[Arthur and Cecil]] both plot to feast on the cubs, after the crocodile finishes them off. Just as the Croc is about to eat the cubs playing in the river, Bagheera saves them by grabbing the crocodile's tail, but the Croc breaks free and charges toward the cubs. The cubs dodge the crocodile who then crashes into\u00a0a tree and faints. Bagheera also gets his voice back after that.\n\nThe Croc reappears as a minor threat to both Bagheera and [[Kaa]] in the episode \"The Great Kaadini.\"\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\">\nJungle_Cubs croc.jpg|The Croc during Season One's intro\nThe Croc01.png\nThe Croc02.png\nThe Croc03.png\nThe Croc04.png\nThe Croc05.png\nThe Croc06.png\nThe Croc07.png\nThe Croc08.png\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*The Croc may have been inspired by Jacala the crocodile from [[Rudyard Kipling]] original Jungle Book stories.\n{{The Jungle Book}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Croc, The}}\n[[Category:The Jungle Book characters]]\n[[Category:Crocodiles]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
