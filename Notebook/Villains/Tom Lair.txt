"\n[[File:Tom_lair02.png|thumb]]'''Tom L\u200bair''' (voiced by Byrne Offutt) is a supporting character from the TV series ''[[W.I.T.C.H. (TV series)|W.I.T.C.H.]]''.\n\n==History==\nHe is [[Irma Lair|Irma]]'s overweight police officer father. He is a party animal and a sports fan who hates when the garage gets dirty and has little patience for fussy people. He can be nice and mean toward Irma at times. He is very strict and expects his children to be clean well-behaved and get good grades. Tom is an expert in interrogatories, as Irma puts it. He is a little more aware of Chris' bad behavior than his [[Anna Lair|wife]]. He is seen doing patrol duty in \"[[Z is for Zenith]]\" where he is almost killed by [[Lord Cedric|Cedric]].\n\n==Family==\n*[[Anna Lair]] (wife)\n*[[Irma Lair]] (daughter)\n*[[Chris Lair]] (son)\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nC is for Changes (3).jpg\nHappy Birthday Will (3).jpg\nHappy Birthday Will (6).jpg\nParent's Night (13).jpg\nG is for Garbage (1).jpg\nTom Lair.jpg\nTom.png\nWitchissue2-31.jpg\nAnna-002.PNG\nAnna-003.PNG\nAnna-004.PNG\nAnna-005.PNG\nAnna-006.PNG\n</gallery>\n\n{{W.I.T.C.H}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lair, Tom}}\n[[Category:W.I.T.C.H. characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Police officers]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Schoolteachers]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Coaches]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]"
