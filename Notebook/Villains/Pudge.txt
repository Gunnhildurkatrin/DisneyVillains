Every Thursday I give Pudge the fish a peanut butter sandwich...|[[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]]}}\n\n'''Pudge''' is an unknown species of tropical fish who was first seen in the opening of ''[[Lilo & Stitch]]''. He also appeared in ''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]'' in the episode \"[[Sinker (episode)|Sinker]]\", and was mentioned in \"[[Cannonball (episode)|Cannonball]]\" and \"[[Ploot (episode)|Ploot]]\". [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] feeds him a peanut butter sandwich every Thursday because she believes Pudge controls the weather.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In a non-canon [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxmT-zQc1GQ deleted scene] from the first film, [[Stitch]] inadvertently caused Pudge to be killed by seagulls, and his body was buried by Lilo beside [[Mr. and Mrs. Pelekai|her parents]]' graves.\n*Pudge also appears in ''[[Disney Friends]]''. If the DS system clock is set to a Thursday, it would be \"Sandwich Day\". Lilo will tell the player to give Stitch a peanut butter sandwich to throw. If Pudge catches it, the weather changes and the player is awarded a pin.\n*It is not wise to feed fish sandwiches, peanut butter or otherwise.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\">\nDLRP - Lilo Holding Pudge the Fish.jpeg\nDCL - Pin Trading Under The Sea - Lilo with Pudge - Pursuit Pin\n</gallery>\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Fish]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
