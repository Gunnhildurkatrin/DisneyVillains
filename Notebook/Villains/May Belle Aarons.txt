However, because she is six years and he is ten, she does not fit the mold of the ideal confidante to him, leaving him still desperate for companionship. She clearly worships him from the beginning, and like him feels that she does not have a place in the family. She is the first of his sisters to learn about Terabithia and becomes the new queen after [[Leslie Burke|Leslie]]'s death. She is the only one he allows to enter there and the only one who has any sort of empathy for, or acceptance of, him in his family.\n{{CharacterStub}}\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Bridge to Terabithia characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Students]]"
