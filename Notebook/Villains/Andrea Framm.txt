She becomes suspicious after repeatedly noticing\u00a0[[Buddy]]'s shadow passing by her window at night. She and Tammy follow him to the Putter home the night of\u00a0Emma's party, where they spot Buddy with\u00a0[[Molly (Air Bud)|Molly]]\u00a0(the Putters' female Golden Retriever) and realized that Buddy had been sneaking out at night because he is in love with Molly, eventually learning they're expecting puppies. Later, Andrea, Tammy, Emma, Josh, and Buddy rescue the puppies from\u00a0Snerbert\u00a0and\u00a0Webster.\n\n=== ''[[Air Bud: Seventh Inning Fetch]]'' ===\nAndrea is initially too sad to go to the bus stop to say goodbye to Josh before he left for college, but with Buddy's help, she manages to get to stop the bus in time to say goodbye.\n\nStarting her first year of middle school, Tammy and Andrea struggled to find an activity to join before both settles on trying out for the baseball team. Tammy was a natural but Andrea struggles at catching and hitting, running the risk of being cut altogether until Tammy, without Andrea's knowledge, convinced Coach Crenshaw that she and Andrea are best friends and if Andrea was cut, she wouldn't play either. Andrea became frustrated when she was benched for most of the season until Randy accidentally hit Tammy in the right elbow with a wild ball causing an injury and leaving her unable to play and Andrea replaced her. However, Andrea's first game in the season resulted in her running into Randy while trying to catch a pop-up fly, causing them to drop the ball and their opponent to win. Andrea came home and found that Josh's old room was being converted into a nursery for her baby half brother, [[Noah Framm|Noah]], and mentioned to Jackie that it felt like she and Josh were being replaced by him, but Jackie convinced her that it was not the case.\n\nAndrea continued to struggle on the team and overheard Tammy confessing to Randy the deal she made with Coach Crenshaw when Randy wondered why Andrea was on the team even though she was terrible. Andrea wanted to give up on baseball until Buddy persuaded her to keep practicing, where she became better at hitting and catching. Andrea became the Timberwolves' pitcher and Buddy played first base (where Buddy was also revealed to be a great baseball player as well). Andrea and Buddy managed to send the team on a winning streak, but the day of their championship game,\u00a0Carlton\u00a0and\u00a0Professor Siles\u00a0kidnapped Buddy, with Tammy and Andrea in pursuit, rescuing Buddy,\u00a0Zack,\u00a0Striker,\u00a0Shooter, and\u00a0Duke\u00a0before experiments could be conducted on them. The Timberwolves struggled without their three star players, but they managed to come back from behind to edge out their rivals, the Baboons, in an 8-7 game, when Andrea scored a double hit.\n\n=== ''[[Air Bud: Spikes Back]]'' ===\n\n=== ''[[Air Buddies]]'' ===\nWhen\u00a0Noah\u00a0was sad about the\u00a0Buddies\u00a0having to go live with new owners,\u00a0Patrick\u00a0told him it was their time to leave, just like when it was\u00a0Josh\u00a0and Andrea's time to go away to college.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\n\nAir-bud-disneyscreencaps.com-716.jpg\nAir-bud2-disneyscreencaps.com-1716.jpg\nAir-bud-world-pup-disneyscreencaps.com-340.jpg\nAir-bud-7th-disneyscreencaps.com-474.jpg\nAir-bud-7th-disneyscreencaps.com-10413.jpg\nAir-bud-spikes-disneyscreencaps.com-2082.jpg\nAndrea Framm.png\nAir-bud-7th-disneyscreencaps.com-8114.jpg|Andrea hugging Buddy after reuniting with him \nAir-bud-7th-disneyscreencaps.com-8116.jpg|Andrea hugging Buddy after reuniting with him \nAir-bud-7th-disneyscreencaps.com-6077.jpg|Andrea hugging Buddy after he helped her practice baseball\n\n</gallery>\n\n{{Air Bud}}\n[[Category:Air Bud characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Toddlers]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Kids]]"
