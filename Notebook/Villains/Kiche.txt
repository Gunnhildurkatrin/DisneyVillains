Kiche infiltrates the dogs while they are being fed and escapes with a fish, which she feeds to her cub. As the expedition resumes the next day, the sled falls over an embankment, spilling Dutch\u2019s corpse onto a frozen lake. Despite warnings from Alex, Jack ventures onto the lake to retrieve a box of ammunition and falls through the ice. Dutch\u2019s corpse falls in as well, supplying Jack with a buoy to help him reach the surface. By nightfall, the wolves surround the prospectors\u2019 camp and Kiche approaches, attracting Digger, the lead sled dog. Skunker realizes she is a \u201cpart dog\u201d decoy luring his animals to the wolf pack. He shoots Kiche and runs to Digger\u2019s rescue, but is overwhelmed by the pack. Jack and Alex survive the night, using fire to keep the animals at a distance. The injured wolf hobbles back to her den, and her cub remains by her side until she dies.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In the book, she never died.\n[[Category:Wolves]]\n[[Category:Hybrids]]\n[[Category:White Fang]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:White Fang characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]"
