Her real name is unknown. She knows how Penny feels about [[Bolt (character)|Bolt]] and tries to stand up for her when her daughter's [[Agent]] pushes the two apart. When Bolt went missing, she comforts her daughter by saying that Bolt loves her and that he isn't scared in the world outside the studio and helps her to make \"Lost Dog\" flyers. When the studio caught fire, she was the only one that noticed her daughter missing and tried to find her.\n\nAfter Bolt saved Penny and the two were placed in the ambulance, her worries were not helped when the agent believes they could use the incident for publicity. Disgusted with the agent's complete lack of care for Penny's well-being (and fed up with everything the studio's put her daughter and Bolt through), she angrily throws him out, telling him the three of them quit and slams the door in the callous jerk's face.\n\nShe and her daughter adopt [[Mittens]] and [[Rhino]] when they discovered the two at the hospital. After Penny and Bolt recover, they move to a rural home, where she grows very close to their new cat and hamster, and became close like a family with the pets.\n\n==Trivia==\n* Since [[Penny (Bolt)|Penny]]'s real father is not seen in the film, it is unknown if Penny's mother is divorced or widowed.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\">\nPenny-her-mom.jpg|Penny with her mother\nBolt-disneyscreencaps com-1695.jpg|Penny asking her mother if she can take [[Bolt (character)|Bolt]] home\nBolt-disneyscreencaps com-1720.jpg\nBolt-disneyscreencaps com-4160.jpg\nBolt-disneyscreencaps com-9225.jpg|Penny being consoled by her mother, saying she misses Bolt so much\nBolt-disneyscreencaps com-10156.jpg|Penny's mother comforting Penny after succumbing from the smoke\nBolt-disneyscreencaps.com-10223.jpg|Mom finally has had enough with the Agent.\nBolt-disneyscreencaps.com-10229.jpg|Penny's mom furiously tosses the Agent out of the ambulance and onto the pavement.\nbolt-disneyscreencaps.com-10235.jpg|\"We quit!\"\nBolt-disneyscreencaps com-10462.jpg|Penny and her mother enjoying their new life with their pets\n</gallery>\n\n{{Bolt}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Bolt characters]]\n[[Category:Bolt]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]"
