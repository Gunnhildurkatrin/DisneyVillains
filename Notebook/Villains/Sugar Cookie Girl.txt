She explained to him that she wanted to go to the parade of cookies, but cannot because she doesn't have a pretty dress to wear. The Hobo cookie immediately decides to help her and convinces her into giving her a makeover assuring that she will be the sweetest one of all.\n\nThe transformation started with dying her short brown hair to blonde by using golden taffy and transformed it into a long updo. Then he created a dress with a cupcake mold, decorating it with blue, purple and white creams adding heart-shaped candies into the blue part of the dress and finishing it with a lovely big purple ribbon. He ended the makeover by adding some makeup on her with power on her cheeks and a red heart-shaped to color her lips.\n\nWith the makeover finished, she immediately loves the results and decides to join the carnival's parade alongside the hobo cookie by sneaking at the end of it. The Judges, disappointed in the other entries, quickly declare her the Cookie Queen and carry her to the throne, separating her with the hobo cookie who helped her.\n\nSuddenly she must choose a king but she refuses each and every one of the candidates with a giggle and a shake of her head. The judges, with no other suitors to present, make their own proposals but are interrupted by the hobo cookie and the guards who are trying to stop him. Seeing her beloved attacked, she announces to her guards to not harm their king, deciding at that moment to choose him as her king. At the end of the cartoon, both attempt to have an intimate kiss in their thrones but their love is so warm it melted the lollypop they used to cover it.\n\n==='''''Cookieland - A Romance of the Cake and Candy World!'''''===\nIn a comic adaptation of the cartoon, she was the princess of the candy town instead of a poor lady. Here she is forced to choose a husband by the land and that husband is chosen by competition. To prove the will of their suitors, she secretly switches places with a servant and felt in love with a hobo cookie who defended her for a Devil foodcake who was harassing her. At the games, he animates the hobo cookie to win the games and defeat the devil food cake. At the end of the games, Hobo won against the devil foodcake because unlike him, he was playing fair and is chosen for the suitor of the princess, but he first refuses because he felt in love with the servant girl he previously defended. In the end, the misunderstanding is cleared up and they live happily ever after.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Concept Art===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nCookie girl concept art.jpeg|Concept art of the cookie girl\n44-4-.jpg|Concept art of her crowning as cookie queen\ncookiecarnival7.jpg\nCookie carnival girl exporeel.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===''[[The Cookie Carnival]]''===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\ntumblr_mgrkk7sVw11r3jmn6o1_1280.png\ntumblr_mgrku2GPHu1r3jmn6o1_1280.png\ntumblr_mgrmvgLGtU1r3jmn6o1_1280.png\ntumblr_mzeqcpIeo01r3jmn6o1_1280.png\ntumblr_mzeqnqJDAL1r3jmn6o1_1280.png\ntumblr_mgrkopEt3O1r3jmn6o1_500.png\ntumblr_mgrkopEt3O1r3jmn6o2_1280.png\ntumblr_matbzgmbe31r3jmn6o1_1280.png\ntumblr_matbvpjh3o1r3jmn6o1_1280.png\ntumblr_matbti7Rzl1r3jmn6o1_1280.png\ntumblr_m5io1m6ZlP1r3jmn6o1_1280.png\ntumblr_m3idp43PhG1r3jmn6o1_1280.png\ntumblr_m2qot6ZP2y1r3jmn6o1_1280.png\ntumblr_m193l6bOrs1r3jmn6o1_1280.png\ntumblr_m192nlpKmg1r3jmn6o1_1280.png\ntumblr_lz76qmuRlZ1r3jmn6o1_1280.png\ntumblr_lyvxof0y021r3jmn6o1_1280.png\ntumblr_lxyjtjALtj1r3jmn6o1_1280.png\ntumblr_lxyjpseVlI1r3jmn6o1_1280.png\ntumblr_lxyj3l7aGs1r3jmn6o1_1280.png\ntumblr_lxyfrd9jZ71r3jmn6o1_1280.png\ntumblr_lxyel9rlG11r3jmn6o1_1280.png\ntumblr_lxyeirAD5J1r3jmn6o1_1280.png\ntumblr_lxye9zrgWv1r3jmn6o1_1280.png\ntumblr_lxye6lO6PA1r3jmn6o1_1280.png\ntumblr_lxydwiq2lO1r3jmn6o1_1280.png\ntumblr_lxyd9rGUqb1r3jmn6o1_1280.png\ntumblr_lxyd3rD3l81r3jmn6o1_1280.png\nTumblr_nj4g95qm1y1r3jmn6o3_1280.png\nTumblr_nj4gw4BXQw1r3jmn6o1_1280.png\n</gallery>\n\n===Printed Media===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nus_zzms350505a_001.jpeg|Her appears below\nus_zzms350428a_001.jpeg|At the beginning of the comic (up right)\nCookie_Carnival_Poster_A.jpg\n1935_COOKIE_CARNIVAL.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nSilly Symphonies VHS Cover .jpg\ni320.jpg|Dreams come true\nSSTCC BOFMPH.jpg\nVHS cover 2.jpg\n15.jpg|A figure of her exhibited in Disney Tokio expo: dreams come true\n</gallery>\n[[es:Cookie (The Cookie Carnival)]][[es:Cookie (The Cookie Carnival)]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Foods]]\n[[Category:Silly Symphonies characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Queens]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]"
