When they see Tilly and Miranda coming in their direction, Sofia encourages Bartleby to go to her and just as he\u2019s about to a gust of wind catches his poem and flies away from him. Riding a shield and with Sofia following they sled down the grassy hill after the poem where it lands in Roland\u2019s hands and accidentally uses it as a tissue to sneeze on. Bartleby sadly walks to the hedges feeling hopeless. Sofia still feels he could still tell her but still he feels to embarrassed by his high pitch voice. When they hear Sir Maxwell singing this gives Bartleby an idea. He will pretend to sing while Maxwell sings from behind a bush. Sofia feeling uneasy secretly doesn't think it\u2019s a good idea but still she went with it.\n\nSofia shows up and escorts Tilly to the garden where Sir Bartleby is waiting for her. She tells her he will sing for her. Tilly is surprised by this and takes a seat on the porch. Once sat down Sir Maxwell begins to sing Bartleby\u2019s poem while Bartleby lip sings to her. Tilly is flattered by his song and really falls for him. However just before the two can share a kiss Bartleby slips and accidentally reveals Maxwell singing from behind a bush. Realising that it was not Bartleby singing Tilly feels a little insulted and quietly walks away after Bartleby fails to give her an explanation. Down in the dumps, Maxwell decides to take Bartleby to do some fencing practice to take his mind off things.\n\nAs Sofia watches Bartleby and Maxwell battle each other she notices that some of Bartleby\u2019s fighting skills look quite like dancing which gives her an idea. At the ceremony, he is shocked to learn that Bartleby really can talk.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nThe-Silent-Knight-51.png|Cover blown\nThe-Silent-Knight-48.png\n</gallery>\n{{Sofia the First}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Maxwell}}\n[[Category:Knights]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Sofia the First characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Horsemen]]"
