He is the father of [[Boy (The Reluctant Dragon)|the boy]].\n\n==Role in the short==\nThe Father is first seen running away scared with his flock of sheep. When passing by his [[Boy (The Reluctant Dragon)|son]], who is sitting next to a tree while reading a book about knights and dragons, he stops. When his son asks what's the matter, the father tells him that he and his sheep saw a monster, which caused him and his sheep to run away scared in the first place, and through the description of the beast, his son deduces that he only saw [[The Reluctant Dragon (character)|a dragon]]. Shocked and terrified by the news, the father runs to town to warn the people about the dragon. He isn't seen throughout the rest of the short after this.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nFather-TheReluctantDragon1.jpg|The Father running scared with his flock of sheep\nFather-TheReluctantDragon2.jpg|The Father panting\nFather-TheReluctantDragon3.jpg|The Father telling his son what he experienced\nFather-TheReluctantDragon4.jpg|The Father showing his son which way he saw whatever frightened him and his sheep\nFather-TheReluctantDragon5.jpg|The Father describing the monster to his son\nFather-TheReluctantDragon6.jpg|The Father relieved when his son assures him it was only a dragon he saw\nFather-TheReluctantDragon7.jpg|\"Only a dragon?!\"\nFather-TheReluctantDragon8.jpg|The Father running scared to warn the townspeople about the dragon\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:The Reluctant Dragon characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Males]]"
