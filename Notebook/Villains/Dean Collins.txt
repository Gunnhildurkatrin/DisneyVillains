(TV series)|W.I.T.C.H.]]''. Collins is a\u00a0history teacher at school who dates Will's mother, [[Susan Vandom-Collins|Susan]]. He was believed to be a monster from Meridian and was attacked by the Guardians. He is also the head of the school newspaper and owns a lizard called Mr. Scales. In the second season, he once again has a relationship with Susan, which really makes Will mad but when Collins saves Susan from death due to Shagon, Will gains trust in him and welcomes him to the family. In the comics, his relationship with Susan is much more serious, they actually getting married in the later part of the series. Susan also confronts him about Matt, wanting to know his \"criminal record\", as she puts it.\n\n==Chronology: Comics==\n===Life as a Musician===\nDean was the lead singer of a famous band called Greensuit. While singing for the band, he used a stage name, \"Cole Dennis\". The group released several records before splitting up.\n\n==Chronology: TV Series==\nMr. Collins was first introduced in the episode \"A Service to the Community.\" The guardians think he is the beast from Meridian, and attack him. It turns out that he isn't the beast. Will says,\" I can't believe we zapped our history teacher!\" They return him home and hopes that he thinks it was all a dream.\n\nIn season 2, Will finds out that Mr. Collins and her mother are dating in \"H is for Hunted.\" She is very upset about this. She stays upset about this until \"M is for Mercy,\" when she sees Mr. Collins saving her mother's life while in her guardian form. She forgives him and invites him over for dinner.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Mr. Collins' name is actually a pun. A ''\"[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_%28education%29 Dean]\"'' is a person with authority in a specific academic field, or an area of concern, or both. So, Professor Collins would be the ''Dean of History''.\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nDean Collins.jpg\nWillanddean.png\nJ is for Jewel (12).jpg\n</gallery>\n{{W.I.T.C.H}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Collins, Dean}}\n[[Category:W.I.T.C.H. characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Schoolteachers]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]"
