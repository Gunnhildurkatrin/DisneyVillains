He was the principal of [[George Washington Carver Community School]] in Season 1, and makes his first appearance in \"[[Baxter's Back!]]\". He is portrayed by Leslie David Baker. In Season 2, he is replaced as Principal by former George Washington Carver alumnus, Octavia Kwan.\n\n==History==\nWhile [[Raven Baxter|Raven]] worries about the declining relationship of her twins, she has a vision of Principal Wentworth suspending someone, due to family drama. Principal Wentworth notes Raven's presence in the gym, and see's her hitting tennis balls, which in turn leads to a teacher being injured and a punching bag being damaged. After berating her, [[Nia Baxter-Carter|Nia]] and [[Booker Baxter-Carter|Booker]] both assure him that nothing of the sorts this will happen again. To make his point clear, Wentworth then suspends Raven from the school for three weeks, preventing her from picking up her children.\n\nWhile walking down the hallway, Wentworth catches Booker dancing, and tells him to wait until the dance tomorrow, warning him from even thinking about it. When the school day ends, he happily greets [[Chelsea Daniels|Chelsea]], who arrives to pick up the kids along with Raven. He acts more formally to her and thanks Chelsea for volunteering for the school dance. This prompts Raven to volunteer too, and Principal Wentworth assigns her to making five-hundered cupcakes.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nRaven's Home - 1x01 - Baxters Back! - In Trouble.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n*\"[[Baxter's Back!]]\" {{Small|(First Appearance)}}\n*\"[[Dancing Tween]]\" {{Small|(Last Appearance)}}\n*\"[[The Missteps]]\" {{Small|(mentioned)}}\n*\"[[The Trouble with Levi]]\" {{Small|(mentioned)}}\n\n{{That's So Raven}}\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Raven's Home characters]]\n[[Category:Principals]]\n[[Category:Schoolteachers]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
