She is voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]].\n\n==Background==\nFang is a very rambunctious, uncivilized tomboyish girl who loves to smash things. She has long orange hair tied in a ponytail. She resembles a cross between both Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm of ''The Flintstones''. She is the butt of a running joke in which she is often mistaken for a monkey, hence her catchphrase, \"Not a monkey!\" However, she frequently acts and appears to look like a monkey and during one episode she finds a tribe of monkeys that exactly resemble her. She is too small to fight most of the time and resents Dave (who is very strong) because of his cowardice. Although she aspires to be a tough barbarian princess (similar to Xena), she secretly likes to play with dolls. Fang wields a spear in combat.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the show, Fang has only worn shoes 3 times.\n*She seems to have no problem with murder, as in the episode \"[[That Darn Ghost!]]\", Dave wondered how to get Candy a ghost, only for her to reply that \"you make one\".\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n{{Dave the Barbarian}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Barbarian, Fang}}\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Dave the Barbarian characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Princesses]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric characters]]\n[[Category:Nieces]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
