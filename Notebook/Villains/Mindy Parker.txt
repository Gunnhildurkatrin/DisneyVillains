She is a member of the network, analyzing the ratings of the ''Bolt ''TV show.\n\n==Role in the film==\nOne day after a take of a ''Bolt'' episode, Mindy arrives at the Sovereign Entertainment studio, catching the\u00a0[[The Director|show's director]] ranting about a visible boom mic in one shot. After she introduces herself, he describes his vision of the show, mainly on Bolt's \"method acting.\" Mindy is unfazed and pressures him to make the show less \"predictable\" by threatening to fire the entire crew, starting with him, if the show loses its ratings. As a consequence of her warnings, the Director makes the cliffhanger episode that causes [[Bolt (character)|Bolt]] to run away from his trailer.\n\nWhen [[Penny (Bolt)|Penny]] and her\u00a0[[Penny's Mother|mother]] are trying to find Bolt, Mindy tells Penny that she understands what she is feeling and that she needs to let Bolt go, so a lot of people will not lose their jobs with the uncompleted episode. Her ultimate fate after the [[Sovereign Entertainment|studio]] catches fire and Bolt and Penny\u00a0start to live an normal life is unknown.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"185\">\nBolt-disneyscreencaps com-1245.jpg\nBolt-disneyscreencaps com-1254.jpg\nBolt-disneyscreencaps com-1441.jpg\nBolt-disneyscreencaps com-1474.jpg|\"How's that for real?\"\nBolt-disneyscreencaps com-2451.jpg\nBolt-disneyscreencaps com-6190.jpg\nBolt-disneyscreencaps com-6213.jpg\nBolt-disneyscreencaps com-9202.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Bolt}}\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Bolt characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
