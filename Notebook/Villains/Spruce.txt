He's the [[Aunt Tilly|Duchess Matilda]]'s butler.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nSpruce loves keeping everything neat and tidy, as shown when he cleans everything he finds dirty. He's also shown to love Tilly's eccentricities as shown when he says \"Your Aunt Tilly has a lot of strange things.\" He's also shown to have a resourceful attitude, as shown when he reminds Sofia of what her Aunt told her.\n\n==Role in the Series==\nAs [[Aunt Tilly|Tilly]]'s butler, his job is to make sure Tilly's manor is in tip-top shape at all times. As such, he is a complete neat freak.\n\nSpruce first appears after Tilly accidentally spills some fish food on the floor, which he cleans up. After Tilly leaves, he helps Sofia get the manor ready for Tilly's garden party. After Sofia accidentally brings the manor's gargoyles to life, he helps her stop them and turn them back to stone. When Tilly gets back, they reveal to Sofia that the whole thing was a test. They then head to the garden party.\n\n==Trivia==\n*While Spruce says he's a hobgoblin, his manner of dress and personality, is more that of a brownie.\n*Spruce is the first character to call Sofia Sophie. This may signify his mistress's familial bond with the princess.\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Sofia the First}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Servants]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Goblins]]\n[[Category:Sofia the First characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
