At the beginning of the series, she is seen as being part of the popular, and perhaps, snooty crowd, yet she proves to have a sweet personality throughout the course of the series.\n\nShe says that she wants to be a cat psychologist when she grows up, yet she secretly dreams of becoming a singer.\u00a0Stage fright prevents her from pursuing this dream until Phil offers the support and encouragement she needs to gain confidence. Later, she becomes interested in journalism and hopes to become a reporter.\n\u00a0\n==Relationships==\n===Phil Diffy===\nWhen they first meet in the pilot of the series, Keely sees him as just a nerd, someone a popular person like her would avoid. Their friendship begins when she goes to him for help with her algebra homework. A few episodes later, she is shocked to find out he's from the future, yet she proves to be trustworthy, much to the relief of the Diffys. Throughout the series, she shares awkward and affectionate moments with Phil, yet it's not until the last episode that they decide to become a couple.\u00a0\n===[[Tia Deanna Fedichelli]]===\nTia is also part of the popular crowd and Keely's girl best friend. The two of them love shopping and often shop together. Keely misses her when Tia moves away at the end of Season 1.\n\n==Episode Appearances==\n===Season One===\n*You Say Toe-Mato\n*Meet the Curtis\n*Unification Day\n*Phillin' In\n*Tanner\n*Raging Bull\n*My Way\n*Daddy Dearest\n*Pheromonally Yours\n*Future Jock\n*Future Tutor\n*Your Cheatin' Heart\n*Doggie Day-Care\n*We'll Fix It in Editing\n*Halloween\n*Age Before Beauty\n*Neander-Phil\n*Double Trouble\n*Milkin' It\n*Corner Pocket\n===Season Two===\n*Versa Day\n*Virtu-Date\n*The Giggle\n*Dinner Time\n*Tia, Via, or Me...
