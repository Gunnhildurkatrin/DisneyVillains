The Endicott family made their fortune in steel mines, gold mines and railroads resulting in Endicott having been sent overseas to attend Snoddington Academy.\n\nWhile at school in 1847, Cornelius met the then 12-year-old [[Harrison Hightower III]]. While the two's families had been feuding for generations, Cornelius had no intention in continuing it, but Hightower's relentless bullying ultimately lead to Cornelius developing an intense hatred towards Hightower, which began a rivalry between the two that would last into their adult lives. Hightower would later be expelled in disgrace for a prank, allegedly involving a goat and a lot of glue. Hightower would blame Endicott for his expulsion, while Cornelius never forgave Hightower for the unbelievable cruelty of the prank.\n\nAs the head of the Endicott family, Cornelius established several new businesses from his home in [[New York City]]. In 1865, Cornelius established the ''U.S. Steamship Company'', prior to 1883 he established the New York Globe Telegraph newspaper, and in 1887 he became highly invested in global shipping. Cornelius had seven daughters with the most notable having been [[Beatrice Rose Endicott]], born in 1883.\n\nWhile Cornelius used his newspaper to expose Hightower's corrupt business dealings, Hightower would often use his wealth to undermine Cornelius at every turn. These would involve Hightower refusing to invite Cornelius to the opening of his hotel (making him the only influential New Yorker not in attendance), and denying him membership to the Pharaoh's Explorers Club, which Hightower controlled.\n\nMuch to Cornelius' dismay, Beatrice Rose was highly interested in the stories of Harrison Hightower III who at this point was an established adventurer. On [[December 31]], 1899, Hightower went missing within the [[Hotel Hightower]] after having returned from Africa with the idol [[Shiriki Utundu]]. While Cornelius was initially suspected to be behind Hightower's disappearance, he was delighted at the subsequent closure of Hotel Hightower, which Cornelius quickly made plans to demolish.\n\nCornelius began to develop his plans for destroying the Hotel Hightower in 1908 but the plan took many years to come into effect.  Amidst this in 1909, Cornelius constructed a new steamship for the U.S. Steamship Company called the ''[[S.S. Columbia]]''. The interior of the steamship was designed by Beatrice Rose Endicott who was also working against her father's plans to destroy the Hotel Hightower after having been unknowingly manipulated by Hightower's manservant [[Archibald Smelding]].\n\nBeatrice Rose suggested to her father that since the SS Columbia would bring tourists to New York, the family should get into the hotel business too. Cornelius, with some advice from Beatrice Rose, began purchasing the land deeds up in secret until he ultimately owned the disputed land which Hotel Hightower sat upon, making him the official owner of the hotel. As thanks for her guidance, Cornelius offered Beatrice Rose any job she liked in the hotel, and she chose to be the manager. However, much to his daughter's shock, rather than reopen Hotel Hightower, Cornelius planned to tear it down and build a new hotel where it once stood.\n\nThe SS Columbia was christened by Beatrice Rose the April 11 of 1911 and made its maiden voyage the March 20th of 1912. Endicott departed on this voyage to Liverpool, [[England]] along with V.I.P. guests [[Theodore Roosevelt|Theodore \"Teddy\" Roosevelt]] and William Howard Taft. This very year, however, Beatrice Rose went behind her father's back and founded the New York City Preservation Society which deemed the Hotel Hightower a historic landmark. This angered Cornelius because, if his daughter was successful, not only would Hotel Hightower be spared, but he'd be required to restore it to its former glory, which Cornelius felt would be \"Hightower's final victory\" against him.\n\nIn the 1920s, Cornelius had an undersea observatory constructed aboard the SS Columbia. Circa [[1925]], the observatory equipped a \"Hydrophone\" and \"Hydrophone Translation Apparatus\" patented by Cornelius that allowed for cross-species communication with marine life. Most notably, Endicott and the sailors of the Columbia would make contact with a green sea-turtle named [[Crush]].\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n=== American Waterfront ===\nSeveral plaques from the New York City Preservation Society reference Cornelius Endicott II's history in New York City.
