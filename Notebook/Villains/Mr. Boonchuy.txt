Later, they had a daughter, Anne.\n\nWhen he and his wife immigrated to the US, they opened Thai Go near their house.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nMr. Boonchuy bears few resemblance to Anne, though mostly the dark brown hair. He has a big chin, dark thick brown eyebrows above his eyes, light wrinkles underneath his eyes and a big yet a bit flat nose. He wears a yellow polo shirt with red stripes having a blue shield like symbol at the heart area as well as a 3 at the back of his shirt, a pair of blue jeans and a pair of white socks in home. He's the tallest in the family.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Mr. Boonchuy was supposed to make his first appearance in \"[[Anne Vs. Wild]]\", via flashback when Anne comments on her history with camping. The artwork depicted him looking much more stocky than his final design.\n*Mr Boonchuy can drive a mini van as shown in the \"[[The New Normal]]\" and \"[[Mr. X]]\" alongside \na motor scooter as shown in \"[[Adventures in Catsitting]]\".\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\">\nAmphibia season 3 poster.jpg\nFam Reunion (Amphibia Season 3- Anne is back!).png\nThe New Normal Mr. Boonchuy Concept art by Cat Sukiman & Andy Garner Flexner.jpg|Jeff Boonchuy Model Sheet\nAnne's Dad.png|Jeff Boonchuy's deleted first appearance\nThe-New-Normal Anne's parants blissfuly unaware.png\nFixing-Frobo Mr. Boonchuy playing online game.png|Mr. Boonchuy playing an online game\nAnne-sterminator (40).png\nAnne-sterminator (42).png\nAnne-sterminator (14).jpg\nMr. X (1).jpg\nMr. X (6).jpg\nMr. X (10).jpg\nMr. X (11).jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*[https://amphibia.fandom.com/wiki/Mr._Boonchuy Mr. Boonchuy] at the [[w:c:amphibiapedia|Amphibia Wiki]]\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Amphibia}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Amphibia characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Asian characters]]"
