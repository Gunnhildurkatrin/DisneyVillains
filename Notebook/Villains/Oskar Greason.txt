He is a student at [[Echo Creek Academy]] and [[Star Butterfly]]'s crush.\n\n==Role in the series==\nOskar makes his debut appearance in \"[[Cheer Up Star]]\", where he is seen making some irritating music. When Star first sees him, she falls over the top in love with him and secretly gives him her number. Star spends the rest of the day waiting for him to call, but he does not until she is in the middle of a fight against [[Ludo]] and his minions.\n\nIn \"[[Girls' Day Out]]\", Oskar reveals he has several keytars in the trunk of his car in case of emergency. However, he doesn't usually remember which of his keytars have batteries in them. In \"[[Star on Wheels]]\", he reveals he pretty much lives in his car and keeps junk, food, and clothes in the car. In \"[[Starcrushed]]\", he reveals to Star he dropped out of school to pursue his music. He was not aware until this episode that Star had magical powers and a wand.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"medium\" widths=\"180\">\nCheer Up Star 6.jpg\nStar talking to Oskar.png\nMewberty-53.png\nStar-On-Wheels-16.png\nStar-On-Wheels-25.png\nOskar Greason Concept 1.jpg\nOskar Greason Concept 2.jpg\nStar on Wheels poster.jpg\nStudents of Echo Creek Academy.png\n</gallery>\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Star vs. the Forces of Evil}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Greason, Oskar}}\n[[Category:Star vs. the Forces of Evil characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
