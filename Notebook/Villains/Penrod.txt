His left arm was a lobster claw and he also had lobster antennae to resemble a mustache. He had three legs unlike other crewmen who had two legs.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|Dead Man's Chest]]''===\nOn board the scuttled ship, Penrod and the rest of the crew confront [[Will Turner]] in combat while [[Davy Jones]] took control of the ship, with Will noticing [[Jack Sparrow]] was nearby on the ''[[Black Pearl]]''. Onboard it, Penrod and the other crew went on it and during this sequence, he prepared to attack [[Marty (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Marty]].\n\nPenrod and the rest of the crew later heave together to get the cannons ready on the ship. During a game of [[Liar's Dice]], Penrod plays the game with the other crew members just as Will Turner offers to challenge against Davy Jones. Jones, however, calls Will's father [[Bootstrap Bill Turner|Bootstrap Bill]] a liar, punishing him to stay on the ship forever while telling Will to feel free to go ashore due to Will's father helping his son not lose the game.\n\nThe next day, Penrod and the crew of the ''Flying Dutchman'' raise the mast while Davy Jones prepares to summon the [[Kraken]] in order to kill Jack Sparrow, Will Turner, and the rest of the crew, because Will took the key from him while he was sleeping. Later at [[Isla Cruces]] when the crew spies on Jack and his crew surviving on Isla Cruces, Penrod and the rest of the crew plan to go after the crew who are seeking [[Dead Man's Chest]].\n\nJust as Penrod and the crew approach the chest Jack and his crew found, the crew stops and continues searching for the chest. Penrod and the rest of the crew then arrive towards [[Elizabeth Swann|Elizabeth]] and [[Pintel and Ragetti]]. Successfully opening the chest containing the Heart of Davy Jones, Penrod and the crew fight against Jack's crew just as Jack and his crew plan to escape from the crew and return to the ''Black Pearl''. Just as the ''Pearl'' faces against the ''Dutchman'', Davy Jones orders his crew to destroy the ''Black Pearl'' just as the ''Dutchman'' fires its cannons to destroy it. As the ''Dutchman'' fails to defeat Jack Sparrow, the crew of the ''Pearl'' celebrates as the moment is interrupted when the Kraken prepares to attack; it turns out that the Kraken is only searching for Jack.\n\nAfter Jack sacrifices himself to save the crew, Penrod and the other crew members only find out that Jack took Davy Jones' heart with him just as Davy Jones plans to take revenge against Jack.\n\n===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|At World's End]]''===\nPenrod returns in this film where Davy Jones and his crew have a conversation with [[Cutler Beckett|Lord Cutler Beckett]] of the [[East India Trading Company]] just as Davy Jones is forced to kill the Kraken. Later, by order of the EITC, Penrod and the rest of the crew attacked [[Sao Feng]]'s crew, the ''Empress'', and executed most of the crew of the ''Empress''. With [[James Norrington]] dead, Penrod and the other crew react in shock just as [[Maccus]] gives orders to escape the cabin just as Davy Jones manages to take command of the ''Dutchman'' under [[Ian Mercer|Mercer]]'s duty.\n\nDuring battle at the maelstrom, Penrod and the other crew of the Flying Dutchman and the EITC soldiers fight against Jack's crew and [[Tai Huang]]'s men while Jack Sparrow fights against Davy Jones. Penrod, however, survived the battle at the maelstrom.\n\nAfter the battle stops when Davy Jones falls to his death, Penrod and the remaining crew members of the ''Flying Dutchman'' revert back to their human forms with Will Turner as the new captain of the ''Dutchman''. Afterwards, both the ''Dutchman'' and the ''Black Pearl'' destroy the HMS ''Endeavor'', defeating Cutler Beckett for good.\n\n==Video game appearances==\n===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (video game)|At World's End]]''===\nPenrod appears as a mini-boss in the game, amongst Davy Jones' crewmen multiple times in the game. To defeat him, the player must defeat regular enemies and then use a special ability to defeat him.\n\n==External links==\n*[https://pirates.fandom.com/wiki/Penrod Penrod] on [https://pirates.fandom.com/wiki/ Pirates of the Caribbean Wiki].\n\n{{Pirates of the Caribbean}}\n[[Category:Pirates of the Caribbean characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
