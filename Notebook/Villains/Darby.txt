She is a red headed 6-year-old\u00a0girl who is the leader of the Super Sleuths and is Christopher Robin's younger best friend. She has a little dog named [[Buster (Winnie the Pooh)|Buster]] and is good friends with [[Winnie the Pooh|Pooh]] and [[Tigger]].\n\n\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nDarby is tomboyish, smart, friendly, and is the leader of the Super Sleuths and the younger sister and best friend of [[Christopher Robin]]. She also likes to solve problems, play, and have fun with her friends in the Hundred Acre Wood while her older best friend and brother goes to college.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nShe is small, slender, and fair-skinned with short red hair, blue eyes, freckles on her face, pink lips, and wears a blue baseball cap with a question mark on it, white shirt, purple vest, purple headband, teal pants, and white and orange sneakers.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[My Friends Tigger & Pooh]]''===\nWhile [[Christopher Robin]] is away at college, Darby is a major character in ''My Friends Tigger & Pooh'', and one of only four to have appeared in every one of the stories, along with [[Winnie the Pooh|Pooh]], [[Tigger]] and her dog [[Buster (Winnie the Pooh)|Buster]], replacing Christopher Robin after he left for college. She is a bright, imaginative young redheaded girl, who along with those three has formed a group of [[Hundred Acre Wood]] problem-solvers known as the Super Sleuths, which she leads. When called to a Super Sleuth case, Darby always \"slaps her cap,\" a bright blue cap featuring a yellow triangle containing a green question mark. Her usual outfit is a white shirt with a purple jumper and blue jeans.\n\nDarby considers Pooh, Tigger, and everyone in the Hundred Acre Wood to be very good friends and will always try her best to help them and make them feel wanted. She is also known for being able to keep a cool head and approach a problem with logic and smart thinking when others may become frustrated. Darby is known to enjoy reading, often fantasy stories. They allow her to imagine other possibilities, though she notes that just because she likes reading about something doesn't mean it's necessarily something that she would want to try herself. Darby is generally aware of the presence of the viewers of the show and will often break the fourth wall to speak to viewers. Darby has a stuffed monkey named Billy Boo.\n\n==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==\nDuring the time of the initial run of ''My Friends Tigger & Pooh'', Darby appeared in many of the Disney Parks. In recent years, Darby has not made any appearances at any Disney Park and has retired since.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n{{Winnie the Pooh}}\n[[es:Darby]]\n[[pt-br:Darby]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Winnie the Pooh characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Detectives]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Playhouse Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Live! characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:My Friends Tigger and Pooh characters]]"
