The Collie leads them to the farm where he brings food for Pongo and [[Perdita]] while the dairy cows feed the puppies. He informs them that they should head to Dinsford next where there is a [[Labrador]] whose owner is a grocer. He then goes outside to guard the door in case [[Cruella De Vil]], Horace, and Jasper appear.\n\nHe is not seen or even heard of for the rest of the film, but it can be assumed that he heard about the Dalmatians successfully returning home.\n\n===''[[101 Dalmatians: The Series]]''===\nThe Collie apparently makes another appearance in ''101 Dalmatians: The Series'' in the episode \"[[Lucky to be Alone]]\". Here, he assures Perdita that he shall keep an eye on [[Lucky (101 Dalmatians)|Lucky]] as he travels to his Aunt Coco and Uncle Beamer Vandercream. When they arrive at the Vandercreams, he cautions Lucky to be careful.\n\nIn this episode, his human seems to be a grocer van driver, though he claims the Labrador to have the grocer human in the animated film. However, it is possible he contacted the Labrador to arrange something.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nLucky WCollieOTDL.jpg\n76d94fb36c58572cf0a84f9e01f352f7.jpg|Pongo and Collie\nTheCollie.jpg\nCollieConceptArt.jpg|Concept Art\n</gallery>\n\n{{101 Dalmatians}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:101 Dalmatians characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]"
