She is a student and cheerleader at [[Middleton High School]].\n\n\n\n\n==Relationships==\nTara is generally nice and easy-going. Although she does hang out with [[Bonnie Rockwaller]], she is also nice to Bonnie's rival [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim Possible]].\n\nIn the show's first season, Tara had a crush on [[Ron Stoppable]].\n\nAt the start of the episode ''[[Emotion Sickness]]'', Tara is shown to be dating [[Josh Mankey]]<ref>[[Emotion Sickness]]</ref>\n\nBy the time of ''So The Drama'', Bonnie updates Kim that Tara is going out with [[Jason Morgan]], the Middleton High School basketball team's star forward<ref>[[Kim Possible Movie: So the Drama]]</ref>.\n\n===Friends===\nShe is mostly seen in the company of\u00a0[[Hope]], both of whom are often beside\u00a0Bonnie Rockwaller's right and left shoulders. She is also\u00a0shown to be friends\u00a0with Kim Possible.\n\n===Love Interests===\nIn the show's first season, Tara had a crush on\u00a0Ron Stoppable. Tara has been seen dating an unnamed boy, [[Josh Mankey]] and went to prom with Jason Morgan, the Middleton High School basketball team's star forward.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Two of Tara's love interests have the same initials, \"J.M.\" \u2013 Josh Mankey and Jason Morgan.\n*Before the fourth season aired on TV, there were rumors that Tara was going to have a bigger role on the show in that season than she did in the first three seasons.\n*Her last name was never revealed on the show, but many fans speculate that King is her last name--an allusion to John Steed's\u00a0third partner Tara King from the British adventure series \"The Avengers\"\u00a0(''not''\u00a0the Marvel Comics superhero group), while others believe that Tara could be named after her voice actress Tara Strong, since they look alike. There has never been any canon proof to back up\u00a0'''''any'''''\u00a0of these theories.\n*According to artwork on [[w:c:kimpossible:Talk:Middleton_High_School#From_a_Very_Early_commercial|an early television commercial]] prior to the debut of ''Kim Possible'', Tara's pre-production name was \"Cindy\".\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nFull Monkey.jpg\nFull Monkey (1).jpg\nSink or Swim (5).jpg\nGraduation Part 1 (35).jpg\nFull Monkey (19).jpg\nFull Monkey (20).jpg\nCrush (8).jpg\nSo The Drama (13).jpg\nSo The Drama (23).jpg\nAll in the News (1).jpg\nReturn to Camp Wannaweep (1).jpg\nReturn to Camp Wannaweep (2).jpg\nReturn to Camp Wannaweep (4).jpg\nReturn to Camp Wannaweep (6).jpg\nSink or Swim (8).jpg\nSink or Swim (9).jpg\nSink or Swim (12).jpg\nSink or Swim (13).jpg\nSink or Swim (14).jpg\nSink or Swim (16).jpg\nSink or Swim (17).jpg\nSink or Swim (18).jpg\nSink or Swim (19).jpg\nSink or Swim (20).jpg\nSink or Swim (24).jpg\nSink or Swim (25).jpg\nSink or Swim (27).jpg\nGo Team Go (1).jpg\nBad Boy (2).jpg\nGraduation Part 1 (43).jpg\nFull Monkey (24).jpg\nFull Monkey (23).jpg\nTara and Josh Mankey.png\nOh Boyz (5).jpg\nOh Boyz (4).png\nSink or Swim (6).jpg|Tara on the bus\nKim and Tara.png\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Kim Possible}}\n[[Category:Kim Possible characters]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Cheerleaders]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
