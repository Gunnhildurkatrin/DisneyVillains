Much like Shanti, she is introverted, sweet and in the song \"My Own Home\" it is implied that she values work ethics and therefore has raised Shanti to be hard-working and patient. According to Shanti, her mother has grounded her multiple times. Since Shanti herself is generally obedient and respectful of authority, this statement may imply that her mother is somewhat of a disciplinarian.\n\nShe is a close friend to Messua and is frequently seen with her and the village leader. She also accompanied her to search for her sons in the jungle, as well as to search for her own daughter.\n\nAs with Messua and Ranjan's father, Shanti's mother is aware of Shanti and Mowgli's romantic feelings and is fully supportive of them both.\n\n=== Physical appearance ===\nShanti's mother bears much physical resemblance to her daughter. She is a beautiful slender woman with olive skin, brown eyes, red bindi on her forehead, golden earrings, thick black eyebrows, and a long black hair covered by a pink headscarf.\n\nIn addition to that she wears a traditional Indian sari, colored in pink and with a purple drape wrapped around her waist and shoulder.\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early life ===\nNothing is known about Shanti's mother beside that she very deeply cares for [[Shanti|her daughter]] and wants her to be safe from any harm, namely [[Shere Khan]]. She also has a husband, who is the father of Shanti and was mentioned by the latter in ''The Jungle Book''.\n\n=== ''[[The Jungle Book]]'' ===\nWhile Shanti's mother does not appear in the film, she is briefly mentioned by her daughter, Shanti, when the latter was fetching the water while singing the song \"[[My Own Home]]\" near the end of the film.\n\n=== ''[[The Jungle Book 2]]'' ===\nShanti's mother appears in the sequel alongside her daughter. She seems to be friends with the Village Leader, Messua, Mowgli, and Ranjan.\n\nUnlike the many other characters, she did not play a very big part in the movie and wasn't seen much in the film either. It is unknown who voiced her in the movie, as she is not mentioned as one of the main characters in the film's credits.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\njungle-book2-disneyscreencaps.com-242.jpg\njungle-book2-disneyscreencaps.com-289.jpg\njungle-book2-disneyscreencaps.com-294.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Jungle Book}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Jungle Book characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Indian characters]]"
