He is stoic and sensible, wanting to think things through. He loves his family and supports them. However, Surak shows he is not completely made of stone, as he was deeply saddened by his mother's passing.\n\n==Role in the series==\n===\"[[The Tree of Life (The Lion Guard)|The Tree of Life]]\"===\nWhen [[Bunga]] causes a rockslide in the mountain pass (due to his obsession of honey), [[Rani (The Lion Guard)|Rani]], Surak, and the rest of the [[Night Pride]] thought that they were a threat. After Kion uses the [[Roar of the Elders]]  on [[Baliyo]], Rani forbids him and his friends from entering the [[Tree of Life (The Lion Guard)|Tree of Life]]. But after speaking with Queen [[Janna]] and the spirits of her parents, Rani agrees to welcome the [[Lion Guard]] to the Tree of Life. After finding the Guard, the Night Pride notices that they cleared the path. Kion apologizes for using the Roar and about the rockslide and humbly asks for [[Ono]] to be healed. Rani accepts Kion's apology and leads them to the Tree of Life just as Kion keeps his promise not to attack Baliyo anymore. Afterwards, Rani soon welcomes them to the Tree of Life.\n\n===\"[[The River of Patience]]\"===\nSurak is seen along the rest of the Night Pride just as Rani brings the Lion Guard inside the Tree of Life to speak with her grandmother Janna to which she asks [[Nirmala]] to help heal Kion's scar. While Kion is getting healed, Janna asks Rani to show the rest of the Guard around the Tree of Life. Later, Surak and the rest of the Night Pride soon fight against [[Makucha]], [[Chuluun]] and [[Ora]]. The Lion Guard comes to help, to which Rani didn't want their help and asks them to leave as soon as possible. Later, Makucha and the others come back again and the Night Pride fights them. During the battle, Baliyo gets bitten by Ora, making him unable to fight. Surak, Rani, and the rest of the Pride were able to drive off the predators away from the Tree just as Baliyo is getting healed due to Nirmala saying the venom from the Komodo dragon that attacked Baliyo will wear off eventually.\n\n===\"[[Little Old Ginterbong]]\"===\nWhen [[Mama Binturong (character)|Mama Binturong]] pretends to be \"attacked\" by [[Makucha's Army]], Surak and the rest of the Night Pride stop them and welcomes her into the Tree of Life. Later, Mama Binturong tells Makucha and his henchmen the Night Pride to overthrow Janna in an attempt to eat the rare animals just as the villains sneak into the Tree. Afterwards, Mama Binturong attacks Bunga and [[Binga]] just as Surak and the Night Pride notice the ambush. Ullu then warns that Mama Binturong has tricked the Night Pride to which Bunga and Binga were able to use their stench ability to defeat her.\n\n===\"[[Poa the Destroyer]]\"===\nSurak is gathered at the Tree of Life with the Night Pride and the Lion Guard to discuss about [[Beshte]]'s bad reputation with the tundra animals to which [[Pinguino]], the lead penguin, then apologizes to Beshte for being rude to him along with the other tundra animals.\n\n===\"[[Long Live the Queen]]\"===\nSurak, the Lion Guard and the rest of the Night Pride fight against Makucha's Army and saving a [[Varya|tigress]] and her [[Feliks, Pasha, and Polina|three cubs]] to which they are able to drive them away. [[Ullu]] soon comes and says that Queen Janna asks to see Kion and the Night Pride. As the Night Pride and Kion arrive at the Tree of Life, Nirmala explains that Queen Janna's time has come. Soon, as Queen Janna dies of old age after telling Rani that the Night Pride will help Rani protect the Tree in the future, Surak, Kion, the Night Pride, and the rest of the animals mourn for her death. Surak does his best to remain strong as he and his family mourn the death of their matriarch, but soon begins crying himself as Baliyo collapses on his shoulder in heartbreak. Surak and the other animals then attend Janna's funeral at the Willows where they give their condolences. Afterwards, Rani becomes the new queen of the Tree just as Surak cheers for his niece as the new ruler; afterwards, Rani walks to Janna's grave telling her she is ready to be queen.\n\n===\"[[The Lake of Reflection]]\"===\nMakcuha's Army comes back to the Tree of Life, which an exhausted Night Pride prepares to fight. The Guard then arrives to help to which Kion and Rani's leadership caused confusion to the Pride. The groups eventually fend off the villains. Afterwards, Kion offers to have the Lion Guard patrol the Tree of Life during the day so the Night Pride can rest. Mama Binturong, unbeknownst to the group, spies on the conversation.\n\nWhen Ullu warns the Lion Guard and the Night Pride about Makucha's Army ambushing the Tree, the two groups fend off the villains thanks to Kion's leadership.\n\n===\"[[Triumph of the Roar]]\"===\nWhen Makucha's Army arrives at the Tree of Life with Ullu asleep (due to her being a nocturnal owl), Surak and the Night Pride plan to confront them only for the Lion Guard to help them defeat them.\n\nWhen Ullu warns the Night Pride about the ambush, they rush to the Tree of Life to warn Rani about this only for them to be trapped by a giant rock blocking the Tree (caused by Ora and the Komodo dragons) just as the army attacks the animals of the Tree of Life. After mastering the roar, Kion, Bunga, and Rani arrive to stop them. Kion uses the Roar to defeat Makucha and the rest of his army and destroy the rock blocking the Tree to rescue the Night Pride.\n\n===\"[[Return to the Pride Lands]]\"===\nAfter letting go of the Roar and handing it over to the new Lion Guard's leader [[Vitani]], (which grants him full mastery of the Roar in the process) Kion asks the Guard if they would like to switch to being protectors of the Tree of Life. They all agree and head back to the tree. With all of Kion's family and friends watching him, Kion becomes Rani's new king.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Family===\n====[[Janna]]====\n\nSurak is Janna's youngest son. He was very saddened when his mother ended her journey in the Circle of Life.\n\n====[[Rani (The Lion Guard)|Rani]]====\n\nRani is Surak's niece, leader, and eventually his queen after the passing of Janna. He follows her lead without question and always offers sound counsel and support.\n\n====[[Baliyo]]====\n\nBaliyo is Surak's nephew and tries to keep Baliyo from acting rash. They are close and fight well together in their duty to protect the Tree of Life. Upon the passing of Janna, Surak comforted his nephew as they shared in their mourning.\n\n====[[Kion]]====\nInitially, Surak thought Kion and his Lion Guard were hostile animals attacking the Tree of Life, though Surak was intrigued by Kion's Roar, correctly suspecting it to be the Roar of the Elders. After Janna requested Rani to bring the visitors to her, Surak was surprised by how the Lion Guard cleared the mountain passage but didn't venture any closer.\n\nSurak came to respect Kion and see him as a fierce warrior and a worthy leader, especially after Kion banished  Makucha's Army from the Tree of Life using his newfound mastery over the Roar. It wasn't long after that Kion would join Surak's family as his nephew-in-law by Kion's marriage to Rani, making him Surak's king.\n\n===Friends===\n====[[Nirmala]]====\n\nNirmala and Surak are often seen together and fight side by side in their duty to protect the Tree of Life.\n\n====[[Ullu]]====\n\nSurak and Uluu are good friends. Ullu works together with the Night Pride.\n\n====[[Bunga]], [[Fuli]], [[Beshte]], [[Ono]], and [[Anga]]====\n\nSurak becomes good friends with all of the members of the Lion Guard. They soon all join the Night Pride when Kion becomes his nieces mate.\n\n====[[Makini]]====\n\nMakini and Surak are good friends.\n\n===Enemies===\n====[[Makucha's Army]]====\nSurak hates Makucha's Army since they tried to eat the animals in the Tree of Life.\n\n==Trivia==\n* It's possible that [[Nirmala]] and Surak could be mates, but unconfirmed.\n* Though Surak is the uncle of Baliyo and Rani, they never call him \"Uncle Surak.\"\n* Surak is a foil to [[Scar]]. Unlike him, Surak is a loving and supportive uncle to Rani and Baliyo (and quite possibly had a healthy sibling relationship with his older sibling). He harbors no hateful envy towards Rani for her role as the next ruler of the Tree of Life as well as no desire for the title himself, content with his role in the Circle of Life.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\">\nThe Lion Guard The Tree of Life WatchTLG snapshot 0.07.25.967 1080p.png\nThe Lion Guard The Tree of Life WatchTLG snapshot 0.07.29.316 1080p.png\nThe Lion Guard The Tree of Life WatchTLG snapshot 0.18.16.674 1080p.png\nThe Lion Guard The River of Patience WatchTLG snapshot 0.08.56.451 1080p.png\nThe Lion Guard Long Live the Queen WatchTLG snapshot 0.08.03.339 1080p.png|Surak and Baliyo crying after noticing that Queen Janna has passed away\nThe Lion Guard Long Live the Queen WatchTLG snapshot 0.09.42.897 1080p.png|Surak, Baliyo, and Nirmala at Janna's funeral mourning the loss of the queen of the Tree of Life\nLong Live the Queen 011.jpg\nLong Live the Queen 012.jpg\nLong Live the Queen 013.jpg\nLong Live the Queen 014.jpg\nLake of Refection 01.jpg\nLake of Refection 02.jpg\nLake of Refection 04.jpg\nTriumph of the Roar 01.jpg\nTriumph of the Roar 02.jpg\nTriumph of the Roar 03.jpg\nNight Pride 03.jpg\nTriumph of the Roar 05.jpg\nTriumph of the Roar 06-0.jpg\nTriumph of the Roar 065.jpg\nTriumph of the Roar 067.jpg\nTriumph of the Roar 078.jpg\nLG Return.0101\nLG Return.0102\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Lion King}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:The Lion Guard characters]]\n[[Category:Lions]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Princes]]\n[[Category:Uncles]]"
