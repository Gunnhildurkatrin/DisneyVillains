She is a star, whom others wish upon in hopes of having their dreams come true. [[Ray]], a Cajun firefly, is deeply in love with Evangeline. Their relationship and the nature of fireflies heavily implies that Evangeline was once, herself, a firefly who assumed the form of a star upon her death.\n\n==Role in the film==\nEvangeline is seen from the start of the film - however, she is referred to only as the \"Evening Star\" at first. She is first wished upon by a young [[Tiana]] for a restaurant she dreams of opening, and years later by Charlotte when [[Prince Naveen]] doesn't show up for the masquerade ball on time. Though disbelieving in the supposed magic of wishing on stars, Tiana, desperate to get her restaurant after being outbid, makes one more request to her, and in the process is introduced to a frog that turns out to be Naveen.\n\nEvangeline is first referred to by name by [[Ray]], who is in love with her - Tiana, Naveen, and [[Louis (The Princess and the Frog)|Louis]] are surprised when they discover her true identity, but go along with it for his sake; as such, they refer to her by name as well throughout the rest of the movie and frequently consult her when facing problems.\n\nAt one point, Naveen reveals to Evangeline his feelings for Tiana and expresses his inability to tell her, and Ray humorously mistakes his words as being directed toward Evangeline herself - however, he is quickly brought to light by Naveen. When Tiana becomes upset by Naveen supposedly leaving her for Charlotte, she angrily tells Ray that Evangeline is only a star - Ray, although upset, claims for it to be nothing more than her 'speaking out a broken heart' and makes a resolve to discover the truth of the matter. During Ray's last conversation with Tiana and Naveen (who have supposedly become permanent frogs), he asks them why they're still frogs and they reply that they're staying that way and staying together to which Ray claims that he and Evangeline like very much. When Ray dies, a rainstorm immediately occurs, which may have been Evangeline expressing her own sadness.\n\nEvangeline is last seen at the end of the film, where after Ray's funeral, a second star appears next to her, symbolizing Ray and the fact that he is finally together with Evangeline. They are later seen together again shining down on Tiana and Naveen as they dance together on the roof of her [[Tiana's Palace|new restaurant]].\n\n==Trivia==\n*The star Ray calls \"Evangeline\" is, in fact, the planet Venus. Venus is known as the Roman goddess of love.\n*Evangeline and her relationship with Ray is inspired by the Cajun poem ''Evangeline'' about a pair of lovers separated from each other when the Acadians were forced out of Nova Scotia, only years later do they finally meet again, only for Evangeline's lover to die in her arms from disease in the midst of a large epidemic.\n*Evangeline\u2019s connection to fireflies harkens back to a gag in ''[[The Lion King]]'', in which [[Timon]] calls stars \"fireflies in the big bluish black thing.\"\n\n{{The Princess and the Frog}}\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:The Princess and the Frog characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]"
