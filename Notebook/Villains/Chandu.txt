The tiger cub sidekick to [[Sindbad]], he has become a mascot for the ride and the [[Arabian Coast]] land in general.\n\n==Background==\nChandu was introduced to the Sindbad attraction in [[2007]] as part of its transformation from \"Seven Voyages\" to \"Storybook Voyage\", due to the original attraction being unpopular with guests at the time of its opening. As Sindbad's human crew was recast as pirates or other figures, Chandu became Sindbad's sole recurring companion as the two voyaged out on adventures, helping people along the way and learning that friendship is the greatest treasure of all.\n\nChandu is very popular in merchandising and one of Tokyo DisneySea's most popular snacks is the \"Chandu Tail\" sold at the Sultan's Oasis snack stand.\n\n==Role in the attraction==\nWhen the guests arrive at the village of Baghdad, they see [[Sindbad]] greeting guests about him going on an adventure to find treasure with his animal companion Chandu where he growls where he carries a map in his mouth. In Mermaid Rocks, Chandu can be seen on top of the sail as Sindbad thanks the mermaids for saving him during a storm. In Rukh Island when Sindbad and Chandu are protecting the rocs from a crew of pirates, Chandu can be seen pouncing on one of the pirates on his head while Sindbad tells Chandu to help protect the rocs from the pirates.\n\nIn the Cave of the Giant, Chandu is seen tying up another pirate with a necklace of pearls. When Sindbad and Chandu rescue the giant and he and the giant sing together, Chandu (only his tail is shown) appears hiding in a treasure chest with a tiger engraved on it. In the Palace of the Sultan, Chandu appears standing on a drum carried by a group of citizens. In the Land of the Monkeys, Chandu peeks in Sindbad's boat filled with bananas before the guests arrive at the Living Straits. In the Living Straits, Chandu can be seen on said creature's water spout. When Sindbad arrives back home, Chandu is last seen sleeping on top of a rope as Sindbad thanks the guests for joining him on his voyage.\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Tigers]]\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
