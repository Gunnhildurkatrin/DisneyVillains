Who gives it light and color as the seasons come and go? Who helps all creatures Great and small to walk? To swim? To fly? Who crafts such tiny details? You might see them if you try. For it's all the work of fairies, but they stay well out of sight. For the first time that baby laughs, a fairy's life takes flight.|The Narrator}}\n\n'''Never fairies''' are magical creatures whose main function is to bring the seasons to the Mainland. They are the main characters in the [[Disney Fairies]] franchise, and they're primary residents of [[Pixie Hollow]].\n\nPixie Hollow's warm seasons are under the rule of [[Queen Clarion]], and all warm fairies recognize her as their ruler. Alternatively, the Winter Woods are under the leadership of [[Lord Milori]].\n\n==Biology==\n===Birth===\nWhen a baby laughs for the first time, a fairy is born. The laugh blows away and he or she is carried by the winds to [[Pixie Hollow]]. Once the laugh makes its way to the Pixie Dust Tree, a dust-keeper sprinkles [[Pixie Dust]] over the laugh, resulting in his or her birth. This is an event called \"The Arrival\". Winter fairies are born when the laugh travels across the border, into the Winter Woods.\n\nAfter a Warm fairy is birthed, [[Queen Clarion]] welcomes them and commences the ceremony to discover what type of talent he or she has. She summons a circle of mushroom pedestals and fairies of each of the talent guilds bring objects to represent their talents; a flower from the garden fairies, an orb of light from the light fairies, a drop of water from the water fairies, a small whirlwind from the fast-flying fairies, a hammer from the tinker fairies, and so on. The artifacts float above the pedestals and the new born fairy is allowed to approach each one. If the fairy tries to take the wrong artifact, then it will fall/dissipate. Once the fairy finds the artifact corresponding to their own talent, it will start to glow. The brighter the artifact glows, the more naturally gifted the fairy is with their talent. We did not see how Winter fairies discover their talents, but it likely resembles the method used by their warm counterparts.\n\nAfter the fairy discovers their talent, Queen Clarion asks to other fairies of the same talent guild to introduce themselves and gives the newborn a name.\n\nFairies can have siblings if the laugh blows away into more than one fairy. They have wings are exactly the same in their design and pattern. When they approach each other, their wings sparkle.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nThe average Never fairy stands at five inches tall (12.7&nbsp;cm). They have pointed ears and four insect-like wings, the upper pair being larger than the lower pair. Each fairy's wing design is unique, there are no two that are exactly the same, with the exception of twins, two fairies born of the same laugh.\n\nFairies can appear to be of any ethnicity, although they usually have button noses and slanted eyes. In the films, however, it appears that some features and talents may be more likely to go together: for example, all Winter fairies tend to have either white or black hair, and many Light fairies have dark hair and skin.\n\nFairies clothes' are made out of nature materials, such as leaves and flower petals. Fairies wear clothing colored to the talent he or she belongs. Green for tinker fairies, red-pink for garden fairies, blue for water fairies, and so on. [[Zarina]], as The Pirate Fairy, is the only fairy seen wearing non-natural clothing.\n\n==Talents==\nEach fairy or sparrowman is naturally gifted with a single, special talent. It reflects his or her most inner qualities and personality.\n\nWhile all fairies have a talent, only those fairies who are the \"Architects of nature\" were allowed visit the Mainland while other fairies stayed in Pixie Hollow their whole lives. However, after the events of Tinker Bell, they were allowed to go the Mainland with the others.\n\nFairies can even grow their own Pixie Dust Tree, altgouht it requires a regular tree with the infusion of Blue Pixie Dust within it. Once done, the now special tree will produce regular golden [[Pixie Dust]] as soon the Blue Pixie Dust is dropping inside it.\n\nPixie Dust Alchemy was created by an incredible gifted and powerful dust-keeper named [[Zarina]], that can change the natural properties of the regular [[Pixie Dust]], giving it another colors and powerful special properties associated with the talents, and can even change the natural talent that a fairy possess if sprinkled on them. When a fairy changes his/her talent, the only way to reverts back to their original is to be sprinkled with the dust related to it.\n\nFairy talents include, but are not limited to:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 100%; \" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\"\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:green; border-color:orange; color:Pink\" |Talent\n! style=\"background-color:green; border-color:orange; color:pink\" |Powers\n! style=\"background-color:green; border-color:orange; color:pink\" |Responsibilities \n! width=\"20%\" style=\"background-color:green; border-color:orange; color:pink\" |Image\n|-\n|'''Tinker-talent'''\n|Tinker-talent fairies are skilled at using various tools to invent and fix things.\n|Tinker-talent fairies build things to help other fairies accomplish their own responsibilities more easily.\n|[[File:Tinker-bell-kinopress-info.jpg|200px]]\n|-\n|'''Water-talent'''\n|Water-talent fairies can manipulate water.
