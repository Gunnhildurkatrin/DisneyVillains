They are [[Di Amara]]'s pet electric eels.\n\n==Background==\nAC and DC originally belonged to the [[San Fransokyo]] aquatic center, but were stolen by Di and placed in a giant tank inside the head office of [[Sycorax]]. They were used as part of her bioengineering experiment to turn [[High Voltage]] into eel-like monsters, an experiment that ended successfully.\n\n==Role in the [[Big Hero 6: The Series|series]]==\nAC and DC first appear in \"[[Something's Fishy (Big Hero 6)|Something's Fishy]], during Di's meeting with Barb and Juniper. AC and DC swim about their tank as the villains negotiate, but pose sinisterly beside Liv as she foreshadows High Voltage's fate. Later on, AC and DC appear in a news report in which Bluff Dunder notes that the whereabouts of the eels following their disappearance from the aquatic center is still unknown. The mention of eels leads [[Fred (Big Hero 6)|Fred]] to believe that electric eels have some connection to High Voltage's ability to control electricity without their energy orb.\n\n==Trivia==\n*They are named after the electrical terms \"alternating current\" and \"direct current\", fitting for their species.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Big Hero 6}}\n[[Category:Big Hero 6 characters]]\n[[Category:Marine Animals]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Fish]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
