"[[File:Char_61135.jpg|thumb]]'''Shelly Klutzberry''' (voiced by [[Candi Milo]]) is Shelton's older sister who has\u00a0fewer appearances than her brother. She resembles her brother, but doesn't change appearance when her glasses are taken off. In \"[[Late Night with Todd & Riley]]\", she is first mentioned as Shelton's sister and also we learn she loves [[Dustin Dreamlake]]. Though never mentioned, she has presumably already had her bar mitzvah.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\">\nLate Night with Todd and Riley.jpg\nLate Night with Todd and Riley (2).jpg\nLate Night with Todd and Riley (16).jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Replacements}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Klutzberry, Shelly}}\n[[Category:The Replacements characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Jewish characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
