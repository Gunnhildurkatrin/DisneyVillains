"[[File:Japan.jpg|thumb]]\nThe '''Dragon of Japan'''<ref>http://www.jeffgoode.com/tv/americandragon/dragons/japan.htm</ref>\u00a0is a minor character who only appeared in the ''[[American Dragon: Jake Long]]'' episode \"[[The Hong Kong Longs]]\". He is one of [[the Dragon Council]] members. He is the first dragon who saved [[Japan]] and wields two swords.\n\nAfter [[the Dark Dragon]], [[Councilor Chang]], and [[Bananas B.]] arrived, the Japanese Dragon turned into his dragon form and realized that [[Jake Long]] slipped something into their drinks. The Dark Dragon, thinking the council members drank his mind control spell, commanded [[Sun Park]] to destroy and kill [[Councilor Andam]], but she suddenly grew long ears, while the Japanese Dragon turned into a codfish, [[Councilor Andam]] tuned into a hippo, [[Councilor Omina]] turned into a sheep, Councilor Kulde turned into a horse, [[Councilor Kukulkhan]] turned into an eagle, and the rest of the dragons turned into different animals.\n\nHe turned back into his dragon form to fight the Dark Dragon.\n\n==Dragon Anatomy==\nDragon of Japan's dragon form resembles a large green dragon. He wields two samurai swords and brown wrist plates. His mane is brown and his short hair is black. His underbelly is a yellowish green. His wings are similar to most dragons, having an arm-and-fingers bone structure. The outside of his wings match the green of her scales, but the inside of his wings are a darker green than his scales.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nJapan1.jpg\nThe Hong Kong Longs (9).jpg\nThe Hong Kong Longs (5).jpg\nThe Hong Kong Longs (4).jpg\nThe Hong Kong Longs (10).jpg\nThe Hong Kong Longs (14).jpg\nThe Hong Kong Longs (16).jpg\nThe Hong Kong Longs (19).jpg\nThe Hong Kong Longs (17).jpg\nThe Hong Kong Longs (20).jpg\nThe Hong Kong Longs (21).jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n{{American Dragon: Jake Long}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dragon, Japanese (Season 2)}}\n[[Category:American Dragon: Jake Long characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Japanese characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Dragons]]\n[[Category:Shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
