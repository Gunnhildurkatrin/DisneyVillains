He would come in contact with their kids: [[Amy Szalinski|Amy]] and [[Nick Szalinski|Nick]] and their two neighbors: [[Russ Thompson, Jr.|Russ]] and [[Ron Thompson]], when they were shrunk by [[Wayne Szalinski|Wayne]]'s [[Szalinzki's Shrinking Machine|shrinking machine]]. They, who were eating from a cookie, were initially frightened off by him. However, they realized that he was not much more than a baby, and chose to befriend him after realizing that he could be used as a mode of transportation. Given the nickname Antie, he was \"driven\" by Ron, using a cookie chunk as motivation. When night fell, Ron attempted to let him go free, but by this time, he had grown attached to the kids and refused to leave.\n\nLater that night, the kids were attacked by a [[The Scorpion|scorpion]]. Antie came to their rescue despite the odds, allowing them to escape. However, he got stung by the scorpion and was poisoned as a result. Though the kids were able to wound and drive off the scorpion, Antie died of his injuries, leaving the kids, especially Ron, to mourn his sacrifice.\n\n{{Honey, I Shrunk the Kids}}\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Honey, I Shrunk the Kids characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Ants]]\n[[Category:Infants]]\n[[Category:Males]]"
