He is the sheriff of Big Butte in Dinosaur Cowboy World. [[Beau Bridges]] voices him.\n\n==Roles==\nIn the episode \"[[The Old Old West]]\", Scaley Briggs first happens upon Penn and company thinking they have committed \"grand theft dino\". He lassoes them and throws them in prison. After one of the townsfolk shouts to him what has actually happened, he accompanies Penn and company to stop [[Rippen]] and [[Principal Larry]], who have trampled the bank and made off with the loot. Scaley tells them he was fired from his job due to his aging, and he seeks to prove that deep inside, he's still the hero he was once.\n\nIn the episode \"[[Amber (Penn Zero episode)|Amber]]\", Scaley has found it hard to concentrate ever since his daughter [[Amber Briggs|Amber]] left him since he didn't consider her worthy of being his deputy.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Ever since black hats started selling out to the general public, Sheriff Briggs finds it difficult to distinguish the good citizens from the criminals.\n*Sheriff Briggs doesn't understand basic mathematics.\n*He sleeps in a casket, since it was the cheapest bed he could afford. Because of this, some might mistake him for being dead.\n\n{{Penn Zero: Part-Time Hero}}\n[[Category:Penn Zero: Part-Time Hero characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Cowboys & cowgirls]]\n[[Category:Sheriffs]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
