'''Experiment 360''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]].\u00a0He is designed to cause populations\u00a0to fall into a near-permanent sleep by simply bleating; only spraying water in the victim's face will awaken them, and other experiments are less vulnerable to his bleatings. His one true place is putting insomniacs to sleep.\n\n\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment 360 was the 360th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to use his sleep-inducing bleat to cause his victims to instantly enter a near-permanent sleep. 360 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch |Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.\n\n360's pod was one of the\u00a0twelve experiment pods recovered by [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Stitch]] in \"[[Drowsy (episode)|Drowsy]]\". His was one of the final four experiment pods (among [[Stopgo|102]], 274 and [[Nosox|204]]) that [[Pleakley]], with some assistance from Stitch, cataloged after being convinced to do so by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]].\n\nSince Lilo had become quite restless lately, [[Nani Pelekai|Nani]] threatened to forbid her from doing any future experiment hunting if she was unable to fulfill her duties or be attentive, so Stitch attempted to get Lilo to fall asleep that night.\n\nEventually, Stitch activated 360 and used the latter's bleat to put Lilo to sleep. However, Stitch had no idea how to wake her up the next morning when Nani called for her. To try and solve the problem, Stitch tried to make Lilo seem awake by putting sunglasses on her, mimicking her voice, and moving her around like a puppet all over [[Kokaua Town|town]].\n\nMeanwhile, 360 escaped and was chased throughout Kauai\u00a0by Jumba and Pleakley, while 360 put everyone he encountered to sleep by bleating. Pleakley initially caught 360 in his purse, but then opened it to put [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] to sleep when the latter was looking for the experiment. At that point, however, 360 jumped out as Gantu fell heavily on Pleakley. Jumba then scolded Pleakley for letting 360 escape.\n\nGantu was later woken up by a bunch of people on [[Lahui Beach|the beach]],\u00a0who thought he was a beached whale and dumped water on him. He then received a call from [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]], who demanded 360.\n\nStitch was unable to wake Lilo up all day until Jumba revealed that the cure to 360's powers was to spray water in the victim's face.\u00a0After Lilo was awakened, Stitch told her that she had to meet someone at the [[Kauai Airport|airport]]. Because she'd been asleep at the time, Lilo started to worry, but Jumba reassured her that Stitch had taken care of all her appointments.\n\nLater, after a long chase, Gantu and [[Reuben|Experiment 625]]\u00a0captured 360 in a duffel bag and guarded the [[Birds of Paradise Hotel]]. However, when they tried to use 360 to kidnap [[Regis Philbin]] (the man from the airport) while posing as bellboys, Lilo and Stitch were there for Regis since he disembarked\u00a0and protected him in every way they could.\n\nLilo eventually recaptured 360, named him Drowsy, and let Regis stay at the [[Lilo's House|Pelekai residence]]\u00a0for the night. In the end, Drowsy used his sleep-inducing powers to send Regis and everyone in Lilo's ''\u02bbohana''\u00a0to sleep.\n\nIn \"[[PJ (episode)|PJ]]\",\u00a0Lilo used Drowsy to put Stitch to sleep after she claimed that Stitch had trouble sleeping lately, allowing Lilo to release [[PJ (Lilo & Stitch)|PJ]] so she could avenge her strict substitute teacher. Strangely, however, Stitch woke up on his own.\n\nIn \"[[Ploot (episode)|Ploot]]\", Drowsy was one of the second team of experiments (along with [[Finder ]] and [[Babyfier]]) formed to try and stop [[Ploot]]. However, Ploot was easily able to defeat them, forcing the three experiments to retreat.\n\nIn \"[[Remmy (episode)|Remmy]]\", Drowsy was one of the experiments in Lilo's dream.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nThe first 624 experiments, including Drowsy, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]] and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nIt is unknown whether or not Drowsy participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]].\n\nThe Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Drowsy's sleep-inducing bleat and sheep-like appearance\u00a0are most likely derived from the mental exercise of counting sheep in an attempt to fall asleep.\n*Drowsy's [[Experiment Pods|pod]]\u00a0color is yellow.\n*The [[Experiment Pod Container]] describes Drowsy as: \"Experiment 360. Primary function: Sleep inducer.\"\n*A recurring irony has occurred with Drowsy. Stitch originally used him to get Lilo to fall asleep, and in his [[PJ (episode)|second appearance]], Lilo used him to put Stitch to sleep.\n**Stitch\u00a0wasn't initially affected when Drowsy put\u00a0Lilo to sleep, though when Stitch was\u00a0put to sleep by Drowsy, he somehow managed to wake up on his own while under Drowsy's effects, possibly indicating that other experiments are not affected as much.\n*Oddly, when Drowsy's image is reflected off of Stitch's eyes in ''[[The Origin of Stitch]]'', he is not yawning for some reason. It is possible that Drowsy's yawning image was taken from ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''.\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Sheep]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
