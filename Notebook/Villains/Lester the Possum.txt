However, he is persistent to get certain other people's attention, such as with [[Max Goof|Max]] when he turned away.\n\nIt is unknown how long Lester has worked as a mascot in the [[Lester's Possum Park|park]], though possibly a very long time.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[A Goofy Movie]]''===\nLester first appears in the movie\u00a0where he walks up to Max and says hello to him. Max ignores\u00a0him (due to being so annoyed about [[Goofy|his dad]] taking him to the park, and because of\u00a0Lester thinking he's a kid), but Lester attempts\u00a0to get his attention by asking him who's his favorite possum. Max then tells\u00a0him not to touch him, and Lester asks\u00a0him what's wrong. He\u00a0starts\u00a0to think that Max is\u00a0sad\u00a0and gives Max a big hug (much to his anger). He then tells Max\u00a0that\u00a0he feels all good and fine, but\u00a0Max angrily slaps him in the face (flipping his costume head backwards)\u00a0and tells him to beat it. The dizzy Lester then staggers slowly away, and\u00a0a group of children tackle\u00a0him and drag\u00a0him away to Max's delight. Lester isn't\u00a0seen again for the rest of the movie, although it is possible he remains in the park.\n\n===[[DuckTales (2017 series)|''DuckTales'' (2017)]]===\nLester makes a cameo in the second season of the ''DuckTales'' reboot, appearing in a digital photo with [[Mark Beaks]] and [[B.O.Y.D.]] who are wearing possum hats.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nLester with Max.png|\"Who's your favorite possum?\"\nLester Hugging Max.png|Lester hugging Max\nMark Beaks at Lester's Possum Park.jpg|Lester's cameo in ''[[DuckTales (2017 series)|DuckTales]]''\n</gallery>\n\n{{Goof Troop}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Goofy Movie Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Opossums]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
