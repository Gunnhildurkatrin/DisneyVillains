He makes his debut in the episode, \"[[The Lost Gorillas]]\".\n\n\n\n== Role in the Series ==\nKing Sokwe sends his two sons,\u00a0[[Majinuni\u00a0and\u00a0Hafifu|Majinuni&nbsp;and&nbsp;Hafifu]]\u00a0out to the\u00a0[[Pride Lands]], to deliver a message to King\u00a0[[Simba]]\u00a0as to whether or not he still agrees to a peace treaty between them. However, they forget his message, and the\u00a0[[Lion Guard]]\u00a0have to escort them home.\n\nWhen they arrive back home in\u00a0Theluji Mountains, Sokwe is seemingly furious with his children for forgetting the message, forgetting their way home from the Pride Lands and for needing the Lion Guard's help in getting back home. He asks his children if they know what it means in a stern voice, and they respond that they do. With a look of austerity, King Sokwe turns around and grabs two small piles of snow with each hand. He turns to his children, exclaims 'Kuishi Ni Kucheka' and dumps each mound of snow on their heads, laughing. Hafifu and Majinuni are relieved, and start to laugh with him.\n\nKing Sokwe explains to them that\u00a0[[Kion]]\u00a0has told him how he was saved by them, and that he is proud of them both. He goes on to say that they are true gorilla princes. Kion then reminds him that they still need to give a message to his father, and King Sokwe laughs. He notices that\u00a0[[Bunga]]\u00a0has a souvenir, a snowball. Kion asks if it's going to be a problem, and King Sokwe states that it isn't. In fact, he claims it to be 'perfect'.\n\nWhen Kion arrives home, he explains what happened to his father. He hesitates to give him the message at first but, when he does, Bunga throws the snowball onto Simba's head. Simba begins to laugh, stating that nobody delivers a peace message quite like King Sokwe.\n\n== Relationships ==\n\n=== Family ===\n[[Majinuni and Hafifu]]\n\nHafifu and Majinuni are the sons of Sowke, he sent them to give a message to Simba. However, they forget the message, and the Lion Guard is tasked with bringing them back to Sokwe to receive the message.\n\nKion told Sokwe of a heroic act made by them, and Sokwe warmly expresses his pride for them, showing that he is proud of his boys.\n\n=== Friends ===\n[[Shujaa]]\n\nKing Sokwe told Shujaa to help the Lion Guard with their cause in the Pride Lands. He appears to be on good terms with his troop member. However, he has slight disconfidence in him on account of him not thinking before he acts.\n\n[[Simba]]\n\nSimba and Sokwe are good friends they have a peace treaty together. Every wet season, he sends a message to confirm whether or not he still agrees to the peace. He always agrees with it every year.\n\n[[Kion]], [[Bunga]], [[Fuli]], [[Beshte]] And [[Ono]]\n\nWhen The Lion Guard brought Majinuni and Hafifu home from the Pridelands he becomes friends with all of the members in the guard.
