You are so great. Look, I make a DNA enhancement for my finest creation! Oooh, I am sick of it! I am sick of it! Well, everything's about to change. We'll see how Jumba feels about you now that I have used the DNA on myself!|621}}\n'''Chopsuey''', A.K.A. '''Experiment 621''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]], and the main antagonist of the video game ''[[Disney's Stitch: Experiment 626]]''. He has all of [[Stitch]]'s powers but is less capable. He is jealous of all the attention that Stitch gets.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nExperiment 621 is shown to be sadistic, prone to jealous hatred and possesses a superiority complex, shown when he became obsessed with proving he was \"superior\" to 626 which included trying to kill him. However, this attitude can be somewhat justified, since Jumba harshly criticized and completely neglected 621 when 626 proved to be a more effective experiment.\n\n621 may be mentally unstable due to his unusual tendency to burst into random laughter and because of his merciless rage. Despite this, he appears to be more intelligent than most experiments, including his ability to speak fluent English.\n\n621 does not appear to be a very capable fighter, only fighting his battles with sheer strength rather than skill. He can also be quite reckless and clumsy in such circumstances.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nIn his regular form (not counting his extra limbs), 621 resembles a slim, dark green koala standing on two, very slim legs. The fur on his belly, bottom jaws, and around his eyes, however, are a dull yellow color. On his rather large-in-proportion head are a pair of bugging black eyes, a large black-green round nose, and a wide underbite with two jutting fangs. His ears are quite long and slim, almost like a bat's own ears, and has creamy yellow insides. He is quite short, standing at three feet, including his dark yellow spiky Mohawk.\n\nHe wears a dark brown sleeveless space suit with a circle consisting of a darker brown border and yellow center on his chest and patches consisting of a brown border and yellow center on each of his legs, black belt with a yellow square buckle and collar, which sprouts into very thin arms ending with long black claws and creamy yellow inner hand/paw pads. His slim, short legs all end with round feet dotted with black toes.\n\nWhen in his mutated form, there is a major difference in his appearance. 621 is now standing at around 6 feet. His eyes are much bigger and bug out a lot more, while his ears are notably shorter than they were before mutation. His chest is quite thick and large now. Sprouting from his chest are some very slim arms that grow into large, muscular forearms ending with elongated black claws. His lower torso is quite small compared to his huge chest, but these sprout into skinny legs with huge monstrous feet. On his back, his spikes have become much sharper and are 1 foot long.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\n621 has similar powers to Stitch but is not as effective at using them. He is both very physical and well-equipped. He is able to use a jetpack and a grapple gun.\n\n*'''Basic experiment attributes:''' 621 has all of the most basic abilities that many other experiments possess. His green hands and feet can produce a sticky substance that allows him to scale walls and ceilings without falling, much like a bug. He has the ability to see very well in the dark (as seen whenever his eyes turn green), lift people/objects that are many times his own weight (he isn't the strongest experiment, but is strong; one can compare his strength to that of an average human weight lifter), and his skeletal structure is so flexible that he can roll around as a ball, curled up while biting onto his legs.\n*'''Retractable limbs:''' 621 can retract and extract extra limbs at any time he wishes. He has an extra pair of arms that have already torn holes on the sides of his brown space suit, sharp black claws at the tip of his fingers, three porcupine-like spikes tipped with whitish-blue and black that sprout from his back, and two bug-like antennae with no real use.\n*'''DNA mutation:''' An ability received after he was genetically altered by Dr. Jumba's mutator machine. His innards, thanks to the special cases of DNA he placed in the machine before mutation, have formed in a way that could boost his strength and adrenaline to alarming rates. Such change occurs upon consumption of fresh genetic material from strong, fast, very well-adaptive creatures (the very well abundant non-magical humans, unfortunately, are out of this category, as they are physically too weak for such use).\n\n::Such material comes in the form of hair, blood, or even nails. The mutation changed 621's body enough for him to handle such consumption (although, most experiments could already handle such a diet). When enough DNA is absorbed, he takes on this stronger, faster form for five posts. Afterwards, he reverts back to normal and will have to search for more material to consume for another mutation.\n*'''Speech:''' Unlike most other experiments, who usually speak [[Tantalog language|Tantalog]] or in no language at all, 621 can also speak fluent English with a vaguely Russian accent, not unlike his creator Jumba Jookiba.\n\nHis weapons are two plasma cannons that he normally keeps hidden with his retracted extra arms. He has a secondary gun, used more for self-defense. This gun fires a beam of green energy at targets, and can teleport them short distances no more than fifteen feet. Where the target reappears is random.\n\n621 was able to mutate himself into a much larger and stronger creature by collecting DNA strands. In this form he is physically more powerful than Stitch but less skilled.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Disney's Stitch: Experiment 626]]''===\n[[File:621 game model.png|right|250px]] \nExperiment 621 was the 621st genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was presumably designed either as a prototype of [[Stitch]] and [[Reuben]], or for Stitch/Reuben's purpose. His original purpose was to collect strands of DNA around the galaxy to help Jumba create more experiments.\n\n621 had been sent around the galaxy to collect DNA strands to help Jumba create more experiments; however, Jumba had been disappointed with his results.\n\nJumba later gave this mission to 626 and was more satisfied with 626's achievements. Jealous of Experiment 626 because of all the attention Jumba was giving him, 621 secretly collected his own DNA and used it to mutate himself into a bigger, stronger form. 621 then battled 626, but was defeated when 626 tricked him into electrocuting himself. The unconscious Experiment 621 was apprehended by [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] along with Jumba and 626 shortly after.\n\n=== [[Stitch! The Movie|''Stitch! The Movie'']] ===\n621 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.\n\n=== [[Lilo and Stitch: The Series|''Lilo and Stitch: The Series'']] ===\nAt an unknown point after this, Experiment 621 was presumably captured and named Chopsuey.\n\n=== ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]'' ===\nAll 624 experiments, including Chopsuey, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, Lilo, Stitch, Jumba, Pleakley, Reuben, and Gantu arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nIt is unknown whether or not Chopsuey participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]].\n\nThe Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.\n==Trivia==\n*''[[Disney's Stitch: Experiment 626|Stitch: Experiment 626]]'', the only media where 621 makes an appearance, had its events retconned from canon in media following the game's release, though 621 could still have the same physical appearance, abilities, and personality.\n**Jumba and Stitch were apprehended in ''[[Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch]]'' moments after Stitch's creation, contradicting the events chronicled in ''Stitch: Experiment 626''. However, Jumba stated in \"[[Kixx (episode)|Kixx]]\" that he trained Stitch between his creation and arrest, which also contradicts ''Lilo & Stitch 2''. This would suggest that ''Lilo & Stitch 2'' is actually non-canon or this episode is partially non-canonic.\n**Even though 621 never made a physical appearance outside of ''Stitch: Experiment 626'', his name is listed in the credits of ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]'', suggesting in the game that 621's canon name is Chopsuey.\n**If this version of Chopsuey is canon, then he is the only experiment to debut in a video game. Since the game was released on [[June 19]], [[2002]], two days before ''[[Lilo & Stitch]]'' was released, he is also the one of the earliest experiments to debut.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nChopsuey in game.png\nChopsuey feeling unappreciated.png\nChopsuey giving DNA to Jumba.png\nChopsuey enters storage room.png\nChopsuey in storage room.png\nChopsuey takes blowtorch.png\nChopsuey using blowtorch.png\nChopsuey steals grapple gun.png|\"Who's superior now?\" - 621 finds the grapple gun\nChopsuey turns away.png\nChopsuey using grapple gun.png\nChopsuey swinging.png|Goof: the tip of 621's highest spine clips through his head \nChopsuey collecting DNA.png\nChopsuey being impatient.png\nChopsuey mocking Jumba.png\nChopsuey still mocks Jumba.png\nChopsuey screams.png\nChopsuey flexes lower arms.png\nChopsuey laughing.png\nChopsuey notices the jet pack.png\nChopsuey reaches for the jet pack.png\nChopsuey steals jet pack.png|621 finds the jet pack\nChopsuey flying.png\nChopsuey collecting DNA in flight.png\nChopsuey on screen.png|\"He's putting DNA in the mutator!\"\nChopsuey explaining his plan.png\nChopsuey cackling before transformation.png\nChopsuey sticks his tongue out.png\nChopsuey dizzy from mutation.png|621 somewhat dizzy after his mutation\nChopsuey says Now we settle this!.png|\"Now we settle this!\"\nChopsuey's mutant form.png\nChopsuey during gameplay.png\nChopsuey during gameplay 2.png\nChopsuey during gameplay 3.png\nChopsuey during gameplay 4.png\nChopsuey during gameplay 5.png\nChopsuey during gameplay 6.png\nChopsuey during gameplay 7.png\nChopsuey during gameplay 8.png\nChopsuey's defeat.png|621's defeat\n</gallery>\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n\n[[ru:\u0425\u043e\u043f\u0437\u0430\u0439]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in video games]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]"
