He is a versatile guy, smart and a little full of himself, he is also a bit dense and stubborn to a fault. But beware the trouble doer when he becomes focused on a case...|''Epic Mickey'' Facebook page}}\n'''Horace Horsecollar''' is an anthropomorphic horse created by [[Ub Iwerks]] and [[Walt Disney]]. Named after the giant plow collar around his neck, Horace first appeared in [[1929]]\u2019s ''[[The Plowboy]]'' as [[Mickey Mouse]]'s cocky steed with a penchant for showboating. Horace has an uncanny ability to morph between a normal and anthropomorphic horse. He rarely speaks, and most often vocalizes through neighs. Mirroring Mickey\u2019s relationship with [[Minnie Mouse]], Horace has traditionally been depicted as the boyfriend of [[Clarabelle Cow]].\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nHorace was introduced as an overweening ham whom adored attention. In ''[[The Beach Party]]'', for example, Horace called for Mickey and Minnie to be his audience as he dived into the sea water. In ''[[Mickey's Gala Premier]]'', Horace lingered on the red carpet of Mickey\u2019s screening, so that he may indulge in the paparazzi.\n\nHorace\u2019s towering height and considerable physical strength (which Horace tended to show off by puffing his chest) contrasted the diminutive Mickey. As Mickey\u2019s steed, he was loyal and diligent. When he and his friends were attacked by mosquitoes in ''[[Camping Out]]'', Horace was quick to protect Mickey, Clarabelle, and Minnie. He even helped defeat [[Pete]] on several occasions, such as ''[[The Cactus Kid]]''. Horace\u2019s reliance on strength leaves little room for brains. While Mickey supplies the plans, Horace supplies the muscle. This is seen in ''[[Get a Horse!]]'', where Mickey used Horace as a tool to rescue Minnie from Pete (in such ways as turning Horace into a fighter jet. Occasionally, Horace can devise cunning plans of his own and has shown mild leadership potential. In ''Camping Out'', Horace led the charge against the swarm of hostile mosquitoes, and found clever ways to use camping equipment to protect himself. In ''[[The Fire Fighters]]'', he used his body to contain and export water in place of a hose during a massive apartment fire.\n\nIn ''[[House of Mouse]]'', Horace retains his brutish ways when working as a technician\u2014particularly in the way he manhandles his anthropomorphic equipment. Behind the scenes, however, he is easygoing to the point of being heedless. When asked for a status update, Horace would instead list off world issues or his own personal ambitions, rather than a status report of the club. He has also broken the fourth wall on occasion; in \u201c[[House of Scrooge]]\u201d, he quipped that the show\u2019s writing had gotten cheaper as a result of Scrooge McDuck\u2019s frugality (in response to a corny joke that Mickey made).\n\n===Physical appearance===\nIn his earliest incarnation, Horace was presented as Mickey's four-legged plow horse. He could walk upright on his hind legs, at which time his forelegs became gloved hands; at other times, he got back down on all fours and reverted to form. Like [[Goofy]] in his early ''Dippy Dawg'' appearances, Horace's body seemed to be formed of rubber tubing. He and Clarabelle Cow had an uncanny ability to change from somewhat normal farmyard animals into anthropomorphized beings as necessary.\n\n===Voice===\nFor most of his career, Horace hadn\u2019t a consistent voice. He would occasionally have speaking roles in such cartoons as ''[[Mickey's Mellerdrammer]]'', but for the majority of his roles, Horace would vocalize through neighs and whinnies like an actual horse. When production began on ''[[The Prince and the Pauper]]'', [[Bill Farmer]] (who at the time had recently assumed the role of [[Goofy]]), was approached to supply Horace with an actual voice. As there had been no actors associated with Horace before, Farmer had to make up an original voice for the character. He was told that Horace\u2019s depiction in ''The Prince and the Pauper'' was that of a snooty, yet droll upper-crust. That inspired Farmer to base the voice on actor Jim Backus, and writer Ben Stein.<ref>[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uXk3knzgWko Cartoon Voices | Comic-Con@Home 2020]</ref> This would remain the basis for Horace\u2019s voice for decades to follow, with Farmer reprising the role as Horace\u2019s official voice actor. In ''[[Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures|Mickey and the Roadster Racers]]'', Farmer deviates from the Backus/Stein interpretation for a more aggressive, high-pitched tone.\n\n==History==\n===1930-1940===\n[[File:Horacehorsecollar.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Horace in his first appearance, ''[[The Plowboy]]'']]\nAfter being removed from Universal Pictures\u2019 [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]] cartoon series, [[Walt Disney]] worked with [[Ub Iwerks]] and a few other loyalists to develop a new character for the studio. One of the concepts that Iwerks had conceived was a horse character, though this was put to the wayside in favor of a mouse named Mickey.<ref>''The Hand Behind the Mouse''</ref> Several months after Mickey\u2019s debut in ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'', Iwerks\u2019s horse would be revived in the form of Mickey\u2019s half-anthropomorphic steed in [[1929]]\u2019s ''[[The Plowboy]]''. Though some of his personality was developed, Horace was not named in this cartoon. In [[1931]]\u2019s ''The Adventures of Mickey Mouse: Book I'', Mickey\u2019s bowler hat-donning steed was referred to as '''Henry Horse'''. His bovine girlfriend, meanwhile, was referred to as Carolyn Cow.\n\nHorace first appeared in ''[[The Plowboy]]'' as Mickey Mouse's non-speaking, domesticated horse pet. He would later go on to gain a recurring spot in Mickey's shorts, living out his role as Mickey's sassy and somewhat bumbling companion. As time would go on, Horace would become more and more humanized, eventually becoming just as anthropomorphic as Mickey and Minnie. He appeared frequently in cartoons from [[1930]] to [[1932]]. The name of Horace's official voice actor in the original run of shorts era is unknown, though Horace rarely spoke in the classic cartoons, especially the black-and-white shorts, where he made realistic horse vocalizations on account of, at the time, how he constantly transitioned himself between being an anthropomorphic horse and a normal four-legged horse.\n\nHis role would become larger in the [[1930]]s, his biggest role being in ''[[Camping Out]]'' where, after harming a young mosquito, an army of mosquitos attack him, Mickey, Minnie, and Clarabelle. Horace, however, notably steals the spotlight throughout the short, acting as the gang's primary muscle. In the end, he's able to send the mosquitos running, saving the day.\n\n===1940-present===\nLater in the 1930s, and into the early [[1940]]s, the frequency of Horace's appearances would greatly decline, with the character becoming more and more obscure every year, until he made his final classic era appearance in ''[[Symphony Hour]]'', after which he was never seen properly in animation again until decades later.\n\nHe was given a small cameo in the [[1983]] featurette ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]''. He is seen dancing with Clarabelle at Fezziewig's Christmas Party in Scrooge's past.\n\n[[File:Pandphorace.png|thumb|250px|left|Horace in ''The Prince and the Pauper''.]]\nHorace later had a larger role as Mickey's pompous tutor in the [[1990]] featurette ''[[The Prince and the Pauper]]''. When Mickey and the prince trade places, Horace never notices the switch and continues to give the \"prince\" the daily lessons.\n\nIn the 1990s, Horace was intended to star in a new TV series to be created for [[The Disney Afternoon]] programming block, titled ''[[Maximum Horsepower]]'', intended to explain his disappearance from cartoons after the 1930s ended. The concept would be that, in [[1939]], Horace had gotten tired of playing bit parts and, after learning that Mickey was going to star in a segment of ''[[Fantasia]]'', was going to demand that [[Walt Disney|Walt]] give him a big role in that movie as well. On his way to Walt's office, however, he gets abducted by aliens who bring him halfway across the galaxy because they are in desperate need of the hero that they believe Horace is, despite his dreams of returning to Earth and resuming his acting career. ''Maximum Horsepower'', however, never came to be.<ref name=\"JimHill\">Jim Hill's Blog: [http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/jim_hill/archive/2007/08/16/tube-thursday-the-disney-afternoon-shows-that-you-didn-t-get-to-see.aspx The Disney Afternoon Shows You Didn't Get to See]. Retrieved on January 11, 2009.</ref>\n\nTwo decades after ''The Prince and the Pauper'', Horace returned to the screen as a major character in [[2013]] short ''[[Get A Horse!]]'', where he, Mickey, Minnie, Clarabelle, and [[Hay Wagon Band|a few other friends]] enjoy a day on the road before Pete arrives and kidnaps Minnie, resulting in Horace and Mickey having to rescue her.\n\n==Films and television==\n===''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]''===\n[[File:4756922938_e3031f767a.jpg|thumb|250px|Horace in ''Mickey Mouse Works''. ]]\nHorace makes several appearances (most of them in brief cameos) in ''Mickey Mouse Works''.\n\nHorace's most notable appearance is in \"[[Mickey's Big Break]]\", where [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] and [[Donald Duck|Donald]] disguise themselves as [[Minnie Mouse|Minnie]] and [[Daisy Duck|Daisy]] in order to retake a picture they broke while playing football. Horace spots Mickey and Donald (dressed as Minnie and Daisy) in the dressing room. Embarrassed, Horace claims that he did not see anything and runs away.\n\nOther ''Mouse Works'' shorts that Horace made cameo appearances in include \"[[Locksmiths]]\" and \"[[Donald's Pool]]\".\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\n[[File:Love my Job.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Horace in ''House of Mouse''.]]\nHorace appears in ''House of Mouse'' as the club's technician, often starting up the cartoons and TV reports shown on the club's big screen; he often did this by attacking the DVD player with a mallet or a boxing glove. As a running gag, Mickey often asks him what is wrong, causing him to list things that are wrong in the world (i.e. \"The Internet's too dang slow!\"), prompting Mickey to rephrase, \"No, what's wrong in here?\"\n\nOne of his most notable appearances is in the premiere episode \"[[The Stolen Cartoons]]\", when [[Pete the Cat|Pete]] breaks into the control room and steals all of the club's cartoons.\n\nIn the episode \"[[House of Scrooge]]\", Horace revealed his big idea to open a barn-themed amusement park called Horaceland.\n\n===''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]''===\n[[File:Horace_Mickey_Mouse.jpg|thumb|250px|Horace in ''Mickey Mouse''.]]\nHorace, along with most of the gang, returns in this animated series. Horace first appears in the background in his traditional [[1920]]s/30s form in \"[[Third Wheel]]\" and also makes a cameo appearance in \"[[The Adorable Couple]]\" as part of a band conducted by [[Goofy]].\n\nHe also appears in \"[[\u00a1Feliz Cumplea\u00f1os!]]\", where he is amongst the cast of characters celebrating Mickey's birthday. In \"[[Three-Legged Race]]\", he partners up with Clarabelle to compete in the titular race. He and Clarabelle are eliminated due to [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]]'s cheating (though Horace and Clarabelle cheated as well).\n\nIn ''[[The Scariest Story Ever: A Mickey Mouse Halloween Spooktacular]]'', Horace briefly appears during the opening credits, where Huey, Dewey, Louie, [[Morty and Ferdie Fieldmouse|Morty, and Ferdie]] visit his house for Halloween.\n\n===''[[Mickey and the Roadster Racers]]''===\n[[File:Horace_MATRR.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Horace in ''Mickey and the Roadster Racers''. ]]\nHorace makes his big return in the ''Mickey and the Roadster Racers'' episodes \"Mickey's Perfecto Day\" and \"Running with the Roadsters\" as a popular Spanish personality named El Horace Horsecollar. He was an arrogant show-off, known for his dancing and superb racing skills. When Horace meets Goofy, he discovers that the latter's talents eclipse his own, and this developed into a one-sided rivalry. In \"Running with the Roadsters\", however, Goofy saved Horace from being run over by a bull, and the two became good friends afterward.\n\nHorace would continue to make appearances sporadically throughout the series. He visited Hot Dog Hills in \"[[Daredevil Goofy!]]\" to participate in the town's race against [[Mortimer Mouse]] and later appeared in \"Garage Alone\" as an actor portraying a villain in a television show that Goofy and Pluto enjoy.\n\n===Other appearances===\n[[File:HoraceMMC.jpeg|thumb|250px|<span>Horace's cameo in the opening sequence of ''The Mickey Mouse Club''.</span>]]\nHorace appears in the [[Mickey Mouse March]] opening sequence along with many other characters in [[The Mickey Mouse Club|''The Mickey Mouse Club'']].\n\nHorace appeared in another small cameo with all the other Toons at the end of the [[1988]] film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''. Here, he takes on the role of a non-speaking police officer.\n\nHorace makes a cameo appearance with Clarabelle in the ''[[Bonkers]]'' episode \"[[CasaBonkers]]\".\n\nIn ''[[Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas]]'', Horace makes a cameo appearance in Mickey's segment \"The Gift of the Magi\", when Mickey is performing for Christmas donations. In this film, Horace's color scheme is gray in contrast to his normal black tone.\n\nIn ''[[The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse]]'', Horace appears as one of the [[Big Bad Wolf]]\u2019s victims in \u201c[[The Big Good Wolf (The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse)|The Big Good Wolf]]\u201d.\n\n==Printed material==\n[[File:Mickey Mouse - Blaggard Castle.png|thumb|250px|left|Horace with Mickey in the ''Mickey Mouse'' comic strip arc ''[[Blaggard Castle (comic)|Blaggard Castle]]''.]]\nHorace has never really been more than a supporting character, though he has starred in numerous European comic book stories of his own. In these, he plays a much bigger role than elsewhere, accompanying Mickey on his adventures or acting as Clarabelle Cow's paramour and fiance. Clarabelle and Horace were engaged in the comics according to some 1931 and 1932 continuities, but neither ever followed through.\n\nFor a brief time, during the late 1960s, Clarabelle Cow began dating [[Goofy]], perhaps in an attempt to give Goofy a girlfriend. The reasons for Clarabelle and Horace apparently breaking up were not given. In 1969, the character [[Glory-Bee]] was introduced as a new love interest for Goofy. In later comics, Clarabelle and Horace were a couple again. Horace is often shown being a boastful slacker, but always managing to land on his feet. One comic had a wealthy man offering to make a large donation to an orphanage in the name of anyone who can duplicate a high dive he had done many years ago. Horace's idle chat of he could easily accomplish that is overheard, and the attention is on him. While Clarabelle Cow said she would like nothing more than to see Horace choke on his own words because of his boastfulness, she prepares him for the high dive on the basis the orphanage badly needs money. When the big day comes, Horace gets cold feet and runs away, but manages to collide with two crooks who were taking advantage of everyone watching the high dive to rob a bank by helicopter. Horace unlatches the sack of cash and lands right in the tank of water, which is what he was fearful of all along! The combination of thwarting the bank robbers and falling from a great height is perceived that Horace was not running away, but putting on an even tougher act, which gets him hailed as the man of the hour and the wealthy benefactor agrees to make an even larger donation for Horace. Although Clarabelle Cow was annoyed that Horace bumbled his way to greatness yet again, she is glad his efforts benefited the orphans.\n\nIn the European comics, especially Italy, Horace is an affirmed repairman in Mouseton to whom Mickey and his friends go when they need something to be repaired or crafted, filling the same spot Gyro occupies in Duckburg (with the difference that Horace does not invent new technology, he just crafts high-quality items). He is often paired with Clarabelle, but their relationship is not fully established, with some stories describing them as boyfriend and girlfriend and others as no more than good friends.\n\n==Video games==\n===[[Kingdom Hearts (series)|''Kingdom Hearts'' series]]===\n[[File:Horace Horsecollar BBS.png|right|250px|Horace as he appears in the ''Kingdom Hearts'' series.]]\nHorace makes a cameo in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', residing in [[Timeless River]], a variant of the [[Disney Castle]] in its early days when it was populated by the classic versions of Disney's iconic characters. He does not play an essential role in this appearance other than walking around the Cornerstone Hill with Clarabelle Cow and [[Clara Cluck]]. \n\nHis role is greatly expanded in ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep]]'', however, as he interacts with Terra, Aqua, and Ventus in [[Disney Town]]. It is assumed that he is still present in either Disney Town or [[Disney Castle]] during ''Kingdom Hearts II'', but Sora never encounters him. In addition to his minor appearance in ''Kingdom Hearts II'', one of the bonsai figures in the Courtyard of the Disney Castle bears a striking resemblance to Horace Horsecollar, in a percussionist's guise. It could very well be him, as he was the percussionist in ''[[The Band Concert]]''.\n\nIn ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]'', Horace made a cameo appearance in the Classic Kingdom minigame \u201cBeach Party\u201d, in which [[Sora]] must protect Horace, Clarabelle, and Minnie from an octopus.\n\n===''[[Epic Mickey]]''===\n[[File:444px-4660Horace Horse Collar 07.png|thumb|left|250px|Horace as he appears in ''Epic Mickey''.]]\nThe classic black and white version of Horace lives in Wasteland, has become a private detective and good friends with [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]] during his time down there before the thinner disaster. Horace's black and white version appears being the forgotten version of Horace from some of the older Disney cartoons while the current version of Horace lives in the real world of Disney.\n\nIn the first game, Horace is found alone in his detective agency in Mean Street. He'll give you some cases to find some missing items or thieves. Should you accomplish Horace\u2019s side missions, the epilogue will feature Horace being surrounded by fans and supporters. Should you ignore Horace\u2019s side missions, he will wallow in his loneliness as his business goes under.\n\nHorace reappears in the sequel, ''[[Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two]]'', with the same role as the first game, but with a new assistant--a [[Lonesome Ghosts (characters)|Lonesome Ghost]] named Tedworth.\n\n===Other games===\nHorace makes appearances in ''[[Land of Illusion starring Mickey Mouse]]'' and ''[[World of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck]]''.\n\nHe is also a playable character in ''[[Disney TH!NK Fast]]''. This is currently Horace's only playable appearance in a video game.\n\n==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==\n[[File:Horace_Character_Central.jpeg|thumb|250px|Horace, posing for a photo at one of the Disney parks.]]\nHorace appears at the [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]] as a meetable character and also appears in select parades. He is typically paired with Clarabelle Cow.\n\nFor a while, Horace donned his outfit from ''The Band Concert''. In November [[2017]], Horace was given a complete redesign, including a new face, sculpt and clothes that more closely resemble his animated counterpart.\n\n===[[Disneyland Resort]]===\nIn [[Mickey's Toontown]], a gym owned by Horace can be seen between several buildings.\n\nHorace was seen in a mural during the [[Disney California Adventure]] expansion as a construction worker and can also be spotted in ''[[Silly Symphony Swings]]''. Horace also appeared during Mickey's segment of ''[[World of Color|World of Color: Celebrate!]]'' at Disney's California Adventure.\n\n===[[Walt Disney World]]===\nHe and Clarabelle often attend the [[Frontierland (Magic Kingdom)|Frontierland Hoedown]] at the [[Magic Kingdom]].\n\nDuring the Christmas season, Horace is found on his float in ''[[Mickey's Once Upon a Christmastime Parade]]''.\n\nNear [[Pete's Silly Sideshow]] at the Storybook Circus, a poster featuring Horace as one of the circus attractions appears.\n\nHorace can be seen in [[Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway]] operating a popcorn stand in the carnival scene. When the tornado from the wooden roller coaster\u2019s logo comes to life, Horace scurries away to safety before he can be consumed by its winds.\n\n==Filmography==\n{{Filmographylink}}\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*''[[The Jazz Fool]]'' and ''[[The Fire Fighters]]'' reveal that Horace wears false teeth.\n*Prior to ''The Plowboy'', a horse similar to Horace in appearance and personality would appear as Mickey\u2019s steed in 1928\u2019s ''[[The Barn Dance]]''.\n*\u201c[[House of Scrooge]]\u201d reveals that Horace dreams of opening his own barn-themed amusement park called \u201cHorace Land\u201d.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n==External links==\n* {{Inducks character|HO}}\n\n{{Mickey Mouse & Friends}}\n{{House of Mouse}}\n{{Mickey Mouse Works}}\n{{Kingdom Hearts}}\n{{Mickey and the Roadster Racers}}\n{{DisneyTsumTsum}}\n{{Disney Crossy Road}}\n{{Mickey Mouse (TV series)}}\n{{Mickey Mouse Funhouse}}\n[[es:Horacio]]\n[[pt-br:Hor\u00e1cio]]\n[[sr-el:Horacije]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Horsecollar, Horace}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Who Framed Roger Rabbit cameos]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Horses]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Epic Mickey characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Police officers]]\n[[Category:Chefs]]\n[[Category:Cowboys & cowgirls]]\n[[Category:Bonkers characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey's Christmas Carol characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse Works characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters in live-action films]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Dancers|Horace Horsecollar]]\n[[Category:Wonderful World of Color]]\n[[Category:Disney Crossy Road characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey and the Roadster Racers characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse (TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Detectives]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse Funhouse]]"
