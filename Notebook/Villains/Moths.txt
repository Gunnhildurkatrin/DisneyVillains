They are the only friends Luna Girl has.\n\nThey also serve as the secondary villain sidekicks.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nThey follow all of Luna Girl's orders and attempt to complete them to the best of their ability. The moths love her, despite her often mean and verbally-abusive treatment to them.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nThe moths are small and white in appearance. They are each about the size of Luna Girl's fingers but can be large when flying in groups.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Even though Luna Girl often treats them quite poorly in some episodes, they still appear to care for her.\n*They almost left her in \"[[Catboy and the Butterfly Brigade]]\" after a large amount of criticism and mistreatment, but went back to Luna Girl when she became sad about it.\n*They may be able to partly speak in English, as they sang the \"We can't think of a rhyme!\" portion of the PJ Masks' theme song in \"[[Catboy's Tricky Ticket]]\".\n*They are shown to be great painters in \"[[Catboy's Flying Fiasco]]\".\n*They made noise for the first time when Catboy used his Super Cat Ears in \"[[Owlette and the Giving Owl]]\".\n*One of them gains a new appearance and a name: Motsuki.\n**She is also the first moth to transform into a humanoid in \"[[Moth on the Moon]].\"\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nLuna Girl rides the giant moth.jpg\nMoths stopping Owlette.jpg\nPainting moths.jpeg\nTwo moths hiding behind a tree.jpeg\n</gallery>\n\n{{PJ Masks}}\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:PJ Masks characters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
