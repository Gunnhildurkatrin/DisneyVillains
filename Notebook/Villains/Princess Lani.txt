Contrary to the image of a pampered little Princess, Lani is very self-sufficient, likes snails, and is very outgoing. She has the virtues of Royalty: She's responsible, kind, brave, and polite. These traits helped Sofia see that she is the Real Princess of Hakalo. However, Lani is also impatient and has a bad temper.\n\n==Role in the Series==\nWhile heading home on a stormy sea, an evil sorceress known as [[Mamanu]] tried to steal the [[Emerald Key]]. She tried to stop her, but the two fell overboard and Lani washed up on the shores of [[Enchancia]]. She showed up at the castle, claiming that she was the owner of the Key when Mamanu, disguised as a princess claiming to be the owner, showed up as well. In order to determine who the real princess was, both girls were challenged to a series of tests.\n\nAs Lani was not a typical type of princess, she did things a lot differently than a graceful and elegant princess that is commonly seen. She does native dancing and has a fondness for all animals and she offered to help Violet clean up a mess.\n\nMamanu succeeded in claiming the Emerald Key only because she cheated by making Lani sleepless the night before. When the Royal Family found this out, they went after her. With help from Sofia's animal friends, they were able to corner Mamanu and Lani was able to get the Key back moments before she disappeared. Lani was soon reunited with her parents and bid her new friends farewell before heading home.\n\nIn \"[[Stormy Lani]]\" it's revealed that Lani and her whole family have the ability to manipulate the weather around the island. Unfortunately, Lani hasn't learned to control her temper and can cause dangerous storms with her powers. The next day, she and Sofia set out on a quest for the fire pearl, a ritual test to prove Lani is ready to enter the Circle of Leadership. Throughout the quest, Lani's temper and frustrations, due to Mamanu interference, cause several incidences of bad weather that threaten the island. Sofia helps her learn to control her temper and calm down by singing about happy, sunny thoughts. Using this technique Lani is able to retrieve the fire pearl that Mamanu dropped in the volcano and send her flying into the ocean. Once she is accepted into the Circle of Leadership, Lani states that she could never have succeeded without her good friend Sofia.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nThe-Emerald-Key-5.png\nleilani.jpg\nemerald key 5.png\nemerald key 6.png\nThe-Emerald-Key-7.png\nThe-Emerald-Key-10.png \nThe-Emerald-Key-11.png|Feeding Clover\nThe-Emerald-Key-12.png\nThe-Emerald-Key-14.png\nThe-Emerald-Key-15.png|Trouble sleeping\nScreen Shot 2014-10-13 at 4.34.57 PM.png|Lani Exhausted\nThe-Emerald-Key-17.png\nSofia and Lani.png|Lani is happy Sofia helped her get the key back.\nThe-Emerald-Key-22.png|Lani reunited with her parents\nStormy Lani 005.jpg\nStormy Lani 014.jpg\nStormy Lani 023.jpg\nStormy Lani 026.jpg\nStormy Lani 028.jpg\nStormy Lani 032.jpg\nStormy Lani 034.jpg\nStormy Lani 037.jpg\nSofia the first - Sunny Thoughts.jpg\nStormy Lani 051.jpg\nStormy Lani 058.jpg\nStormy Lani 060.jpg\nStormy Lani 062.jpg\nStormy Lani 064.jpg\nStormy Lani 066.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Sofia the First}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lani, Princess}}\n[[pt-br:Princesa Lani]]\n[[Category:Sofia the First characters]]\n[[Category:Princesses]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Polynesian characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]"
