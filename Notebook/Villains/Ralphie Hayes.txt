He was a teen actor on a commercial that was selling dog food. Many people have mistaken [[Austin Moon]] for him, because they look alike, except the dog food guy has an afro. For this reason Austin became concerned that he would be regarded as a has-been and rushed [[Ally Dawson|Ally]] into writing a new song for him. He is portrayed by [[Ross Lynch]].\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hayes, Ralphie}}\n[[Category:Austin & Ally characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]"
