They are two griffins who live in the castle jewel room along with their son [[Jasper]].\n\n==Role in the series==\nThey first appear with their son in \"[[The Amulet of Avalor]]\", when [[King Roland II|Roland]] takes [[Sofia the First (character)|Sofia]] and [[Princess Amber|Amber]] to the castle jewel room. Roland tells Sofia that they guard the treasure because griffins love shiny things. They take their job of guarding the jewels very seriously.\n\nThey reappear in \"[[Minimus is Missing]]\" to help Sofia, James and Amber recover the missing flying horses. It is revealed that despite their fierce appearance, they are actually very gentle creatures, who are happy to help Sofia, whenever she asks. Opal is very tolerant with Amber, who did not know how to fly, and would accidentally interfere with her flying. Onyx tries to be a good example for his son, such as trying to teach him to sit still and learn what the task at hand is. Both love Jasper very much, though they both agreed they never would get him back into the jewel room after this adventure.\u00a0\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"180\">\nSofia the first S03E02 (8).jpg\nSofia the first S03E02 (31).jpg\nSofia the first S03E02 (11).jpg\nSofia the first S03E02 (33).jpg\nSofia the first S03E02 (12).jpg\nSofia the first S03E02 (38).png\nSofia the first S03E02 (30).jpg\nSofia the first S03E02 (17).jpg\n</gallery>\n{{Sofia the First}}\n[[Category:Sofia the First characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Griffins]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:Mystical animals]]\n[[Category:Hybrids]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]"
