She and [[Trudy Proud]] are best friends just like their husbands. Like Trudy, Sunset does not like when her husband does something irresponsible. She is also a cop. Sunset, and her daughter LaCienega, both share their names with actual streets in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. In the first episode, [[Oscar Proud|Oscar]] is seen checking out Sunset upon seeing her and her family move in across the street, but for the rest of the series, Oscar and Sunset rarely interact and when they do, it\u2019s usually when he and Felix get caught by their wives doing something dumb. Due to Trudy and Sunset's friendship, Sunset has taken the role of [[Penny Proud|Penny]], [[BeBe & CeCe Proud|BeBe and CeCe]]'s aunt.\n\nSunset looks great for her age as she stays physically active and practices women's self-defense classes which she once invited Trudy to attend with her to \"keep Oscar in check.\" Like her daughter, she too takes good looks very seriously, but to a lesser degree. She also teaches her daughter to be polite to elders and respect authority.\n\n==Physical Appearance==\nSunset is relatively tall and has brown hair and brown eyes. She wears golden triangular earrings with matching bracelets on her left wrist, a red sewater, tight maroon pants and red high heels. While on police duty, she is usually seen on a motorcycle wearing a blue and gold helmet with a badge in the middle as well as sunglasses, a tan jacket, burnt tan pants with a brown belt and black boots. In [[Tiger Whisperer]], her daughter is seen wearing this same uniform as Sunset takes her for a ride-along for 'Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day'.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Sunset and her daughter, LaCienega are named after {{WikipediaLink|Sunset Boulevard}} and {{WikipediaLink|La Cienega Boulevard}}, two Los Angeles area arterial roads that meet in West Hollywood, California. Also, [[Sunset Boulevard]] is the name of one of the themed lands at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]].\n\n{{The Proud Family}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Boulevardez, Sunset}}\n[[Category:The Proud Family characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]\n[[Category:Police officers]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
