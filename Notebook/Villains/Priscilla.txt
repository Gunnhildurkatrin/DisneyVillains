This is because when casting director [[Jamie Sparer Roberts]] watched an interview with Kristen, she explained her love of sloths and how she had a meltdown of joy about getting to meet a sloth for her birthday. They asked her if she would do two words of dialogue if it was a sloth, and she answered in two to three minutes, \"Yes.\" Roberts jokes, \"It was the quickest deal ever made in [[Hollywood]].\"\n\nAt one point during development, she was married to [[Flash]].<ref name=\"Jared tweet\"/>\n\n==Role in the film==\nDuring [[Judy Hopps]] and [[Nick Wilde]]'s visit to the Zootopia DMV, they enlist Flash's help in tracking down a vehicle. However, while Flash is inputting the vehicle's license plate, Nick distracts Flash with a joke, much to Judy's dismay. Flash then retells the joke to Priscilla, angering Judy even further.\n\nDuring the time of [[Gazelle]]'s performance, Priscilla and Flash are seen ''literally'' slow dancing as they hold paws.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nYes...
