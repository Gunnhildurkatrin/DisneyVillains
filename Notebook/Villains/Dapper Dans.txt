They only currently play in the [[Magic Kingdom]] and [[Disneyland]], doing so since both parks' opening days. They formerly played at [[Disneyland Park (Paris)|Disneyland Paris]] and [[Hong Kong Disneyland]].\n\n== Summary ==\nThey are a \"streetmosphere\" show that occasionally play every day in [[Main Street, U.S.A.]] They can be easily differentiated by the color of their outfits (red, blue, purple, and yellow, with one of them sometimes, but not often, dressing in green) and always come in a quartet. Despite four actually coming out, about twelve are actually hired to do the performances. On occasion, they are seen with organ chimes, a musical instrument that resembles a pipe organ, but it is hand held and doesn't sound like an organ at all, it makes more of an exotic sound rather than that of an actual organ.\n\nIn the [[Magic Kingdom]], they perform nine sets a day, seven days a week. There is also a working barbershop where your hair can be done by them while they are serenading. In the morning, they can be seen riding a horse drawn trolley and all over Main Street in the afternoon. At 5pm, they join the Main Street Philharmonic. They also join the Flag Retreat Ceremony.\n\nThe songs sung by them are traditional and classic songs such as \"''[[Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah]]''\" or \"''[[The Mickey Mouse Club|The Mickey Mouse Club March]]''\" with comical acts and jokes.\n\n=== Seasonal Variants ===\nDuring the Fourth of July, their outfits would be the colors of the American flag.  During Halloween events, their attires change to a white and orange color scheme with black bands around their elbows and armpits, being called the, \"'''Cadaver Dans'''\". At this time of year, they sing numerous songs about or sung by villains, and sometimes other songs such as \"''[[This is Halloween]]''\" or ''\"[[Grim Grinning Ghosts]]''\". During Christmas they sing more Christmas oriented songs.\n\n==Rides==\n===''[[Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway]]''===\n[[File:Dapper Dans .jpg|thumb|250px]]The Dapper Dans make a cameo appearance in Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway as dogs.\n\n==Other Appearances==\n===''[[The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse]]''===\nThe Dapper Dans make a cameo in \"[[I Heart Mickey]].\"\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The Dapper Dans are some of the few\u00a0Disney Parks\u00a0characters featured in Main Street, U.S.A.
