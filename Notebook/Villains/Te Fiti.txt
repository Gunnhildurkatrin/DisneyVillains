She is able to create life\u2014an ability used to create the islands of Polynesia. After [[Heart of Te Fiti|her heart]] had been stolen by [[Maui]], she became '''Te K\u0101''', a demon of earth and fire. With Te K\u0101 in her place, the islands that Te Fiti created are slowly consumed by a life-killing darkness.\n\n==Background==\nTe Fiti was the first entity to appear in the world inhabited only by the [[ocean]]. Te Fiti used her life-giving [[Heart of Te Fiti|heart]] to spread the gift of life across the world, creating multiple islands that would be inhabited by flora, fauna, and humans. Following her vast creation, Te Fiti laid herself to rest and formed her body into an island. Over the time, Te Fiti's heart became a much-desired treasure. Villainous thieves such as the giant crab [[Tamatoa]] and bloodthirsty [[Kakamora]] pirates all sought the heart for their own nefarious purposes and self-interests. Only the mischievous and highly-regarded [[Maui]] was daring enough to invade Te Fiti's shores in hopes of giving her heart to mortals as a gift. Using his shapeshifting abilities, Maui found Te Fiti's spiral and stole the heart. As a result of its removal, the island fell into darkness, and the physical entity of Te Fiti morphed into a negative shell of her former self: Te K\u0101.\n\nAs Maui made a hasty escape on his boat, a vengeful Te K\u0101 rose from her slumber and confronted him. Their battle resulted in the loss of the heart, and as punishment for his crimes, Te K\u0101 banished Maui to a [[Maui's Island|desolate spit of land]] in the middle of the open ocean, where he would be doomed to remain stranded for eternity. Meanwhile, with Te Fiti now a dark entity, a devastating curse would slowly begin to spread across the world, destroying flora and fauna, making it impossible for humanity to survive. According to legend, only the restoration of Te Fiti's heart can end the blight.\n\n===Personality===\nTe Fiti's sole purpose is to spread life across the ocean. She values nature and the beauty that comes alongside it. Moving with gentle grace, often seen with a tranquil expression to match her radiant features, Te Fiti is selflessness and purity incarnate. Though she will not hide her displeasure in those who wrong her, she is forgiving should the individual in question look to redeem themselves.\n\nWhile Te Fiti is a largely compassionate entity, Te K\u0101 is - quite literally - a heartless creature with a fiery disposition. The theft of her heart has stripped her of Te Fiti's benevolence, replacing it with malice aimed at both Maui and the world at large. Te K\u0101 and Te Fiti are polar opposites, with differing goals and ideals; while Te Fiti wishes to spread life and beauty, Te K\u0101 seeks to bring death and corruption. As she guards Te Fiti's fallen shores with a spiteful scowl, Te K\u0101 looks to destroy anyone who dares cross her path, and will relentlessly pursue her target until they either depart, or face a bitter end.\n\nDespite this, Te Fiti's purity lies deep within Te K\u0101. Should someone call to it, as Moana did during the climax, she will slowly ease her tension and succumb to her inner, gentle nature.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nTe Fiti, as well as her Te K\u0101 aspect, is an enormous embodiment of the earth, but her appearance differs between the two forms.\n\nThe colossal Te Fiti takes the form of a feminine figure with a human face not unlike Moana's. Her body is covered in lush flora and trees; clusters of flowers adorn her grassy hair similar to a headdress. Her entire body appears to be made of the land itself, with a flowing \"dress\" made of plants and flora. She can also assume an island form when dormant; when this happens, she assumes a resting position.\n\nMassive in size, Te K\u0101 towers above all who encounter her, and is usually depicted with a hollow scowl and an expressionless, skull-like face. She is comprised completely out of lava, with molten skin and flames as her hair. Always surrounding her slender form is a dense pyrocumulus cloud, coupled with bolts of lightning and volcanic ash. She has no legs, her lower half made of a shapeless mass of lava, and she moves about by crawling with her hands. On her chest is a spiral carving of where her heart once was; should it be reattached, Te K\u0101 will return to her true form.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nTe Fiti's power lies in her ability to generate life around her and her control over it as a goddess of life. As a living island, she can grow plants of all sizes and can manipulate the terrain around her body, as well as change size seen just before she returns to a dormant state near the end of the film. With her heart, she can create other islands teeming with flora and fauna, and affect these elements from afar, as shown by Te K\u0101's curse. However, she could also rejuvenate the life in the islands Te K\u0101's curse had once affected. Because of her godly status, she was also able to create and recreate items previously destroyed, such as Moana's boat and Maui's fish hook (which itself was a weapon forged by the gods).\n\nAs Te K\u0101, most of her abilities are derived from her elemental control over fire, lava, and magma. With these assets, she can create fireballs and turn matter into molten rock. Aside from water, which can temporarily solidify her lava form, Te K\u0101 does not appear to have any true weaknesses. She can even regenerate her hands when severed within seconds. The only way to truly \"defeat\" her is to subdue her long enough to return Te Fiti's heart to its rightful place. This will inevitably obliterate the being known as Te K\u0101, and revive her true identity.\n\nShe is also extremely powerful in her strength\u2014so much so that she overpowers the capacity of a demigod, though one can pose as a decent adversary for a period of time.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Moana (film)|Moana]]''===\nTe Fiti is first seen in traditional animation during [[Gramma Tala]]'s opening story. She tells the surrounding children about the day in which Maui stole Te Fiti's heart, and warns that it must be restored before humanity faces a slow and painful death at the hands of the lava demon Te K\u0101. Shortly afterward, the [[Ocean]] selects Tala's granddaughter, [[Moana (character)|Moana]], as the heroine capable of saving the world.\n\nYears later, Moana journeys with Maui to Te Fiti's island, which has been covered entirely by molten rock. Te K\u0101 acts as a demonic guardian and prevents anyone from approaching Te Fiti's shores. Fortunately, Moana manages to do so, but she finds that Te Fiti is nowhere to be found. She looks to Te K\u0101 and notices a spiral on the lava goddess' chest, indicating that she is actually Te Fiti. Moana sings \"[[Know Who You Are]]\" to Te K\u0101, which in turn reforms the beast as she at long last finds a measure of peace in Moana's words. Moana gently rests her forehead on the bridge of Te K\u0101's face before placing the heart back into her chest.\n\n[[File:moana-disneyscreencaps com-10662.jpg|thumb|250px|Te K\u0101 transforming back into Te Fiti.]]\nTe K\u0101's lava skin turns to molten rock and crumbles away, releasing Te Fiti from her age-long torment. Te Fiti silently restores her island and undoes the damage caused by Te K\u0101 across the world, as well as Moana's boat. Maui bashfully tries to joke with Te Fiti, but the goddess is not amused. He then apologizes in a formal manner, confessing that he has no excuse, which earns Te Fiti's forgiveness. As a reward for helping Moana restore the heart, Te Fiti recreates Maui's fishhook, which had been previously destroyed by Te K\u0101. She then bids farewell to Moana and lays herself down to rest as the heroine returns home.\n\n===Other appearances===\nTe Fiti and her alternate forms (herself, an island, and Te K\u0101) appear in the ''[[As Told by Emoji]]'' retelling of ''Moana''. Notably, the battle between Moana, Maui and Te K\u0101 parodied the popular app game ''Pok\u00e9mon Go'' \u2014 here called \"''TeK\u0101mon Go''\". In the game, Pok\u00e9mon evolve into different Pok\u00e9mon, and as such, Te K\u0101 evolved into Te Fiti at the end of the game.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*In earlier versions of the movie, the lava antagonist of the film was named \"Te Po\", and was described as a brutal and villainous land spirit.<ref>\"Unstoppable\", ''Moana'' outtake demo</ref>\n*The way Te K\u0101 crawls toward Moana as she parts the sea is very reminiscent of [[Ursula]] from ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' as she reclaims [[Ariel]].\n*Both Te Fiti and Te K\u0101 are goddesses of the earth, albeit in differing ways. Te Fiti is a more obvious representation, being manifested by lush greens and plant life, symbolizing earth's nature. On the opposite side, Te K\u0101 is manifested by lava and magma which, when combined with water, creates land. Despite their differing ideals, both elements add to the planet.\n*\"Te K\u0101\" means \"the burning one\" in Maori. The development name for Te K\u0101/Te Fiti, \"Te Po\", means \"the dark one\" in the same language. \"K\u0101\" is also a possessive particle in most Polynesian languages, which fits the character's loss of identity.\n*Although an original character, Te Fiti draws parallels with similar goddesses in Polynesian lore:\n**Te K\u0101 bears similarities to the religious Hawaiian figure [[Pele]], the goddess of fire, lightning, wind and volcanoes.\n**Te Fiti's story role and the \"Te Po\" name initially given to Te K\u0101 resemble \"{{WikipediaLink|Hine-nui-te-p\u014d}}\", the Goddess of the Night that was central to Maui's failed quest for immortality in Maori mythology.\n*Te K\u0101 is depicted as one of Maui's tattoos, as the aftermath of their battle for the heart of Te Fiti is illustrated on the latter's back.\n*Te K\u0101 is made up almost entirely of effects animation. Art director of characters Bill Schwab described her as \"the most challenging character to design in the film\".<ref name=\"art\">{{cite book|author=Julius, J., Lasseter, J., Malone, M.|date=2016|title=The Art of Moana|publisher=Chronicle Books|pages=113}}</ref>\n*In earlier designs, Te K\u0101's facial appearance was slightly more human. She appears as a more demonic figure in the final film.\n*Like Moana and Maui, Te Fiti is connected to the film's overarching theme of identity. After losing her heart, Te Fiti is blinded by anger and rage as she smites the world in an act of vengeance. She forgets her initial purpose - forgets who she is - which causes the film's central conflict until Moana steps in and reminds Te Fiti that she is not identified by anger and hate, but by love and compassion.\n*Te K\u0101 is unique in that she is the only villain in the Disney animated feature canon to face a peaceful demise, rather than a gruesome one. Also significant is that she was not a villain that needed to be defeated; rather, she needed to be liberated from her torment and be brought to peace in order for the damage she had caused to be undone.\n*According to the audio commentary on the ''Moana'' Blu-ray release, Te K\u0101 was originally going to be a speaking character, but this was later scrapped.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Moana}}\n{{Disney Emoji Blitz}}\n[[fr:Te Fiti]]\n[[pt-br:Te Fiti]]\n[[Category:Moana characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Goddesses]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Demons]]\n[[Category:Locations]]\n[[Category:Polynesian characters]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Moana locations]]\n[[Category:Islands]]\n[[Category:Polynesian Mythology]]"
