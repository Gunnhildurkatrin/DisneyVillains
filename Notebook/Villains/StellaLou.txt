Columbia]]. When she stumbled, Duffy called out to her in concern. StellaLou told Duffy that she dreamed of becoming a dancer. Duffy thought that a dream was just something you had when sleeping, but StellaLou explained that a dream is also seeing what you want to be when you grow up. StellaLou was practicing so hard, Duffy was sure her dream would come true.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nFile:StellaLou pic promo.jpg|StellaLou promo\nStellaLou toy plush.jpg|StellaLou plush\nSteps to Shine climax.jpg|[[Gelatoni]], [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]], StellaLou, [[Duffy the Disney Bear|Duffy]], [[Minnie Mouse|Minnie]], and [[ShellieMay the Disney Bear|ShellieMay]] in ''Steps to Shine''\nStellaLou Steps to Shine.jpg|StellaLou in ''Steps to Shine''\nStellaLou's Greeting Drive.jpg|[[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]], [[Duffy the Disney Bear|Duffy]], and StellaLou in ''StellaLou's Greeting Drive''\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.tokyodisneyresort.jp/treasure/duffy/ The official Tokyo DisneySea website for Duffy and Friends] ('''Japanese \u65e5\u672c''')\n* [http://www.tokyodisneyresort.jp/treasure/duffy/stellalou/ The official Tokyo DisneySea page for Duffy and Friends: StellaLou] ('''Japanese \u65e5\u672c''')\n{{DisneyTsumTsum}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Tokyo Disney Resort]]\n[[Category:Tokyo DisneySea]]\n[[Category:Hong Kong Disneyland]]\n[[Category:Rabbits]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Shanghai Disneyland]]\n[[Category:Tsum Tsum characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Dancers]]\n[[Category:Duffy and Friends]]\n[[Category:Aulani]]\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Toys]]"
