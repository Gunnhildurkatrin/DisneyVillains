"[[File:Holly_Doll.jpg|thumb]]'''Holly''' is a [[Disney Attractionistas]] doll centered around [[The Hollywood Tower Hotel|the Hollywood Tower Hotel]]. The doll was sold exclusively at the [[Disney California Adventure]] [[The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror|Twilight Zone Tower of Terror]] gift shop. She was discontinued following the announcement of the closing of the [[California]] attraction.\n\n==Background==\n\"Holly is a night owl - and so is her pet owl, Terra. Her parents run an old hotel with endless staircases and mysterious hallways just waiting to be explored. Late at night, Holly roams through the maze-like halls. She also stays up until dawn watching vintage black-and-white movies through the blurry, static-filled screen of her old television set. (All of these movies seem to have a sense of glamour to them - even the scary ones, which are Holly's favorites.) It is fitting that her favorite Disney Parks attraction is at the ''Hollywood Tower Hotel''.\"\n\n{{Tower of Terror}}\n[[Category:The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror]]\n[[Category:Dolls]]\n[[Category:Attractionistas]]\n[[Category:Tower of Terror Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Toys]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
