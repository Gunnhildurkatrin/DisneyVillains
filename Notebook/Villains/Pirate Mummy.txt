While Hook sets his sneaky plan into motion, the Pirate Mummy overhears them entering the tomb. Later, the pirates enter the chamber of the ankh, and Hook and Smee were revealed as the mummies that chased the heroes earlier. Captain Hook grows so impatient with the ankh nowhere in sight that he begins throwing various levers, sealing everyone within the chamber, and revealing the real Pirate Mummy, much to the fright of the other pirates. Much to their surprise, the Mummy was more afraid of them and was no threat to the pirates. Jake asks if they could borrow the ankh to assist Captain Flynn, but Captain Hook demands the ankh for himself and tried pulling another lever, believing it would grant him the treasure, but instead forces sand to fill the chamber. Thinking, Jake asks for the ankh, which the Pirate Mummy reveals, and informs him how to use the power of the ankh to rescue everyone from the sand. But even after the ordeal, greedy Captain Hook was still determined to have the golden ankh, much to the annoyance of the Pirate Mummy, who pulls another pirate booby-trap, sending Hook and Mr. Smee flying out of the Pirate Mummy's tomb.\n\nThe Pirate Mummy is last seen lending Jake and his crew the golden ankh's power to free Captain Flynn's ship and allows the young pirates to visit his tomb anytime they like.\n\n==List of Appearances==\n* ''[[Treasure of the Pirate Mummy's Tomb]]'' (first appearance)\n*\"[[Jake's Awesome Surprise]]\"\n*\"[[Happy 1,000th Birthday!]]\"\n\n==Trivia==\n*[[Jack McBrayer]] also voices [[Wander]] from ''[[Wander Over Yonder]]'', [[Fix-It Felix Jr.]] from ''[[Wreck-It Ralph (film)|Wreck-It Ralph]]'', and [[Irving Du Bois]] from ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\">\nPirate Mummy02.png\nPirate Mummy03.png\nPirate Mummy04.png\nJake-mummy.jpg\nJake Season3\nPirate Mummy-Treasure of the Pirate Mummy's Tomb01.jpg\nPirate Mummy-Treasure of the Pirate Mummy's Tomb02.jpg\nPirate Mummy-Treasure of the Pirate Mummy's Tomb03.jpg\nJake's Awesome Surprise04.jpg\nJake's Awesome Surprise03.jpg\nJake's Awesome Surprise01.jpg\nGroupshot-Jake's Awesome Surprise.jpg\nJake&crew-Happy 1000th Birthday!.jpg\nPirate Mummy-Happy 1000th Birthday!.png\nPirate Mummy-Treasure of the Pirate Mummy's Tomb04.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Jake and the Neverland Pirates}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Jake and the Never Land Pirates characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Captains]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]"
