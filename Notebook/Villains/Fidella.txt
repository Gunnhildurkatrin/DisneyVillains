She has a tan muzzle, tan fur above her hooves, and blue eyes. She wears a distinct saddle with the sun symbol of the Kingdom.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nLike other horses, Fidella is incredibly fast, outrunning humans easily. She is also shown to be able to walk over and avoid tripping over obstacles, as she got past a group of rabbits that were blocking her and [[Rapunzel]]'s path.\n\n===Weapons===\nAs a horse, Fidella lacks the means to wield weapons properly and relies on her hooves and teeth.\n\n== Appearances ==\n=== ''[[Tangled: Before Ever After]]'' ===\nFidella is first seen (mounted by Rapunzel) racing with Eugene and Maximus the border wall\u00a0while being pursued by the Royal Guards, she has gotten Rapunzel to the wall first and helps her to climbs to the top, after that they raced back to Corona for the welcoming ceremony.\n\nThat night,\u00a0she helps her owner Cassandra to sneak Rapunzel outside Corona. \u00a0During their outing, a mysterious rock causes Rapunzel's golden hair to grow back, just before the area rapidly begins to fill with [[Black Rocks|black rocks]] sprouting from the ground, the bridge beneath them begins to crumble apart,\u00a0the gang survive and head back to Corona before Rapunzel's coronation.\u00a0\n\n===''[[Tangled: The Series]]''===\nFidella returns in the series and still serves as Cassandra's horse. Fidella doesn't appear too much in the first season but it is shown in \"[[Max's Enemy]]\" that Maximus appears to have a crush on Fidella and gets jealous when a new horse, [[Axel (Tangled)|Axel]] impresses Fidella. After Axel's defeat, Fidella is shown to be impressed by Max revealing Axel's true colours and that he is the horse to [[Lady Caine]].\n\nFidella joins Rapunzel, Cassandra, Eugene, Shorty, Lance and Hook Foot on their journey to [[The Dark Kingdom]] and both horses pull the [[Rapunzel's Caravan|caravan]]. Fidella and Maximus often help the gang in their situations.\n\nAfter Cassandra's betrayal, Fidella serves as Rapunzel's horse at times and sometimes also as [[Varian]]'s horse. Fidella is used by Varian in the penultimate episode, \"[[Once a Handmaiden...]]\" and again in the series finale, \"[[Plus Est En Vous]]\" after the defeating of [[Zhan Tiri]]\nFidella leaving Corona with reform Cassandra to find her own destiny.\n\n==Trivia==\n*It is shown in \"[[Max's Enemy]]\" that Maximus has a crush on Fidella.\n*Fidella is shown to be [[Cassandra (Tangled)|Cassandra's]] horse but is sometimes used by Rapunzel and Varian.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nTangled-Before-Ever-After-86.png|Rapunzel riding Fidella\nWhat the Hair 25.jpg\nWhat the Hair 28.jpg\nFlynn casa FHPI.png\nPascal's Story - Rapunzel 09.jpg\nPascal's Story - Eugene and Cassandra.jpg\nMax's Enemy 21.jpg\nMax's Enemy 23.jpg\nMax's Enemy 19.png\nPainter's Block 20.jpg\nPainter's Block 26.jpg\nSecret of the Sun Drop 81.jpeg\nSecret of the Sun Drop 30.jpg\nSecret of the Sun Drop 83.jpeg\nBeyond the Corona Walls 17.png\nForest of No Return 14.jpg\nForest of No Return 18.jpg\nFreebird 7.jpg\nRapunzel and Eugene - Vigor the Visionary (1).jpg\nVigor the Visionary 6.png\nVigor the Visionary 13.png\nVigor the Visionary (7).jpg\nRapunzel and Eugene - Vigor the Visionary.jpg\nKing Pascal 18.jpg\nKing Pascal (8).jpg\nMaximus_and_Fidella_watching_the_Lorb_party.jpg\nTangled Season 3.jpeg\nThe King and Queen of Hearts (58).jpg\nPlus Est En Vous - Varian and Fidella.jpg|[[Varian]] riding Fidella\nPlus Est En Vous (5).jpg|Fidella leaving Corona with Cassandra.\n</gallery>\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nVisual development for Cassandra 1.jpg\nTangled the series S2 Poster.jpg\nTagnled TV Merchandise 12.jpg\nFidellatsumtsum.jpg\nTangled The Series Figurine Playset.jpg\nTangled Deluxe Doll Set.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Tangled}}\n[[pt-br:Fidella]]\n[[Category:Horses]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Tangled characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
