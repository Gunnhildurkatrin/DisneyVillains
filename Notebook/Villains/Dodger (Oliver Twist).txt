The Artful Dodger.\"}}'''Jack Dawkins''', better known as '''The Artful Dodger''' or simply '''Dodger''', is the main deuteragonist in Disney's ''[[Oliver Twist]]''. He is [[Fagin (Oliver Twist)|Fagin]]'s lieutenant, a thief, and [[Oliver Twist (character)|Oliver]]'s best friend.\n\n==Role in the film==\nDodger is first seen catching an orphan named [[Oliver Twist (character)|Oliver Twist]] trying to steal an apple from a market in London. Dodger stops Oliver from committing the theft and pretends to take him away when in fact, he simply intends to make a proper thief out of him since he, himself, is a master of thievery and to avoid him getting caught by the police. So, he decides to take Oliver to meet his fatherly mentor, [[Fagin (Oliver Twist)|Fagin]] at their hideout after introducing himself to Oliver as Jack Dawkins, better known as \"The Artful Dodger\" or simply \"Dodger\" in order to provide him with food and shelter and probably a way to reach Governor's Square; Oliver's point of destination when he learns that Oliver is an orphan.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:English characters]]\n[[Category:Oliver Twist characters]]\n[[Category:Deuteragonists]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Orphans]]\n[[Category:Dickensian characters]]"
