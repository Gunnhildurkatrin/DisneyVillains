He appeared in the episode \"[[When Goldie Met Bear]]\".\n\n==History==\nIn the episode, he, [[Mama Bear]] and [[Papa Bear]] tell the story of the meeting of Goldie and [[Bear (Goldie & Bear)|Bear]]. It is explained that he was sent out first with Goldie to find a location for their home. He invited everyone in Fairy Tale Woods to a house warming party.\u00a0 During the party a notice came, saying that they where in the wrong woods. He replied back, telling [[Mrs. Locks]] that the plans have changed and that they are moving to Fairy Tale Woods. He and his wife appear more in Season 2.\n\n==Trivia==\n* His name resembles Robin of Locksley, better known as [[Robin Hood (character)|Robin Hood]]. This similarity was elaborated upon in [[Goldie's Do-Over Day]] when Robin's wife [[Mrs. Locks]] was revealed to have the first name Marian, like [[Maid Marian]].\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Goldie & Bear}}\n[[Category:Goldie & Bear characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]"
