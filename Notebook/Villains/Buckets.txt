When Queen Delightful was still a little girl, she was her imaginary friend and they used to play together when Delightful visited her uncle's mansion every summer. Buckets called Delightful \"Mopsy.\" Little was Delightful aware that Buckets was a ghost. They were the best of friends and they would spend the day building sand castles by the sea, wishing on shooting stars and singing songs.\n\nFor some reason Delightful and her uncle fled the mansion, possibly because of Bucket's presence; however, despite being a ghost, Buckets was friendly and liked to play games and sing.\n\nYears later, Queen Delightful sent the 7D and [[Lord Starchbottom]] to find Buckets. (Misunderstanding, they thought she meant actual buckets.) When they arrived at the haunted mansion, Buckets kept appearing and reappearing and despite being friendly towards them, the 7D and Lord Starchbottom always kept freaking out every time they saw her, screaming and running away in fear. Buckets followed them back to the castle and was reunited with Queen Delightful.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"180\" captionalign=\"center\">\n640px-S01e09a Grumpy freaks out after seeing Buckets.jpg\nDelightful and Buckets building a sandcastle 1.png\nDelightful and Buckets building a sandcastle 2.png\nDelightful and Buckets as mermaids.png\nDelightful and Buckets watching the stars.png\nDelightful and Buckets building a sandcastle 3.png\nI-like-you-flower-hit-I-like-your-face-as-well.png\nWhere-nobody-can-hear-your-screams.png|\"Where nobody can hear your screams.\"\n</gallery>\n\n{{The 7D}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:The 7D characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Spirits]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
