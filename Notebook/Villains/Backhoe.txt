'''Experiment 040''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp;&nbsp;Stitch'' franchise]]. He\u00a0is designed to be an efficient digger and scrape up vegetation.\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment 040 was the 40th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Jacques von H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel's]] funding. He was designed to dig up vegetation.\u00a0040 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.\n\nAt an unknown point, 040 was presumably activated, captured by [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Stitch]], tamed, and named Backhoe.\n\nIn \"[[Shoe (episode)|Shoe]]\", Backhoe was one of the experiments that helped turn [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]]'s [[Jumba's Ship|ship]] into a [[Jumba & Pleakley's Bed & Not Breakfast|hotel]].\n\nBackhoe was one of the experiments in \"[[Checkers (episode)|Checkers]]\" that joined Stitch in a rebellion against [[Gantu]]. Earlier in the episode, he, along with [[Yin]] and [[Digger]], helped Lilo make mud.\n\nIn \"[[Remmy (episode)|Remmy]]\",\u00a0Backhoe was one of the experiments in Lilo's dream.\n\n===''[[The Origin of Stitch]]''===\nBackhoe was one of the experiments that were gliding on the screen, but he is 569 instead of 040.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nThe first 624 experiments, including Backhoe, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium\u00a0to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]], and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nBackhoe participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]].\n\nThe Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Backhoe was activated off-screen.\n*Backhoe seems to always be smiling, but he can be quite vicious as seen in ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nScreenCapture 08.07.13 2-15-19.jpg\nScreenCapture 08.07.13 2-18-43.jpg\nScreenCapture 08.07.13 2-30-22.jpg\nScreenCapture 08.07.13 2-36-43.jpg\nScreenCapture 08.07.13 2-43-45.jpg|Backhoe relaxing\nScreenCapture 08.07.13 2-56-58.jpg\nScreenCapture 23.08.13 8-11-30.jpg\nScreenCapture 23.08.13 8-53-04.jpg\nScreenCapture 23.08.13 8-59-52.jpg\nScreenCapture 23.08.13 9-00-38.jpg\nScreenCapture 23.08.13 9-01-14.jpg\nScreenCapture 25.06.13 16-49-36.jpg\nScreenCapture 25.06.13 16-52-31.jpg\nVlcsnap-2012-07-02-19h42m30s140.png\nVlcsnap-2012-07-02-19h42m39s46.png\nVlcsnap-2012-07-03-21h08m53s43.png\nVlcsnap-2013-06-17-18h39m11s221.png\nVlcsnap-2013-02-08-11h58m00s88.png\nVlcsnap-2013-03-14-09h02m54s66.png\nVlcsnap-2013-03-30-19h50m30s116.png\nVlcsnap-2013-03-30-20h17m07s98.png\nVlcsnap-2012-08-02-20h56m43s41.png\nVlcsnap-2013-04-03-21h41m26s43.png\nVlcsnap-2012-07-03-21h27m08s117.png\nScreenCapture 03.04.13 14-16-57.jpg\nVlcsnap-2012-07-03-22h16m18s43.png\nThe Origin Of Stitch Backhoe.png|Misidentified as Experiment 569 (Glenn)\nPanes14.jpg\nStitch Now - Backhoe.png|Backhoe in ''[[Stitch!Now]]''\n</gallery>\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
