He is honest and kind and cares about what's right. He is also very brave and bright. Unlike Sir Oliver's bravery, Jaxon's bravery comes from chivalry and which makes one self-sacrificing. He's also quite humble and gives credit where it's due.\n\n==Role in the series==\nSir Jaxon makes his debut in the episode, \"[[The Tale of the Noble Knight]]\". Sir Jaxon befriended the Dragons of Brazendell. This enabled Jaxon to learn that the dragons are harmless. This knowledge along with his knowledge of [[Sir Oliver]]'s desire for glory enabled him to discover that Sir Oliver caused the fires the dragons were being blamed for so he could obtain the Ice Fire Shield to get rid of them and look like a hero. Knowing nobody would believe him due to the present hysteria, Jaxon resolved to protect the dragons himself by getting the Shield first and stopping Oliver. Sir Jaxon first appears after Sofia helps Sir Oliver out of the trap he set for him. Jaxon and Oliver fight a duel that Oliver wins through a cheap maneuver that Jaxon and Sofia both agree is a dirty trick. After he escapes from the imprisonment the trick put him in, Sir Oliver opens the dam and causes a flood. After Sofia rescues him, Sir Jaxon reveals to the young Princess Sir Oliver's deception and Sofia believes him because of Oliver's earlier dishonorable actions. Together, Sofia and Sir Jaxon defeat Sir Oliver and expose him to the King of Brazendell. After Oliver is banished, the King awards the Shield and the position of First Knight to Sir Jaxon.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Blair Underwood, Jaxon's voice actor, also does the voice for [[Makuu]] on the Disney Junior animated series ''[[The Lion Guard]]''.\n*Sir Jaxon's coat of arms is a\u00a0dragon, mostly due to his friendship with the dragons of Brazendell.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nTale of the Noble Knight 4.png\nSofia &amp; Minimus saving Sir Jaxon.png|Jaxon saved from drowning by Sofia and Minimus. \nThe Tale of the Noble Knight 10.jpg\nOliver deception.png|Jaxon explains Oliver's deception.\nJaxon First Knight.png\nTale of the Noble Knight 8.png|\"Sofia, I couldn't have done it without you.\"\n</gallery>\n\n{{Sofia the First}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jaxon, Sir}}\n[[Category:Sofia the First characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Knights]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]"
