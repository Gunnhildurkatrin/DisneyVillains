She appears as a main character in\u00a0''Tinker Bell to the Rescue'', in it she has a crush on the\u00a0dust keeper,\u00a0Jerome Jerome.\n\nShe was first mentioned in\u00a0''[[Beck and the Great Berry Battle]]'', when they say that a raccoon had trampled through her garden.\n\n==In Tinker Bell to the Rescue==\nThistle is jealous of\u00a0[[Tinker Bell]] because Thistle has a crush on\u00a0Terence. Thistle plots against Tink several times, such as making others think she had lost her talent by ruining one of her pots, turning her into a bat by making her listen to a [[Mermaid]] sing, and putting quarrelweed\u00a0in Bess's\u00a0studio knowing that Tink was going to stop by with Terence. Thistle really feels bad about this, that's when she meets Jerome and starts to develop feelings for him. He pushes her to apologize to Tinker Bell, but she doesn't know how Tink forgives her, when she sees her crying. She becomes friends again with everyone.\n\n{{Disney Fairies}}\n[[Category:Fairies]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Disney Fairies characters]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]"
