His outfit appears to be a red, white, and blue suit with a black belt around it that has a golden circle and a yellow star in the middle, along with black heeled boots.\n\n==Background==\nHe is the siblings' world-famous daredevil adoptive father. He is a semi-former stunt artist, and is constantly working on new tricks. His appearance resembles that of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evel_Knievel Evel Knievel]. He is also rather immature, and is seen having a teddy bear known as \"Evel Bearnievel\". He thinks that C.A.R. is his best friend, though C.A.R. doesn't see it that way. Dick bought Riley a mule named Prince Cinnamon Boots instead of a horse like she wanted. Like Todd, Dick isn't smart at all. In \"[[The Spy That Wasn't Riley]]\", we learn that Dick is afraid of clowns and tries to force Todd to be a stunt man instead of a circus clown for his career. In \"[[She Works Hard for the Movies]]\", we learn that Dick was in a movie back in the 1970s. We also hear Dick sing his first true song; \"[[Space Training Montage]]\" in \"[[Space Family Daring]]\". It is also revealed in one episode that he is a better cook than K.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"185\" captionalign=\"center\">\nThe Replacements Season 2 Episode 9 English Dub.jpg|\"HERE'S DICKY\"\nAlicorn hoodie.png\n6241C6A9-2EC9-43F9-AA08-5588F1DE42A1.jpeg|His voice picture from behind the voice actors\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{The Replacements}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Daring, Dick}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:The Replacements characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Spies]]\n[[Category:Superheroes]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
