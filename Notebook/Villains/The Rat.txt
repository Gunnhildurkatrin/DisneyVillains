She sees it, growls, and chases after it, causing the rodent to scamper through a hole in the fence, and into a hiding place under a building across the street.\n\nThe Rat has a catalytic role in the climax of the film when it comes back to [[Jim Dear]] and [[Darling]]'s [[Lady's House|house]] while Lady is tied to her doghouse on a rainy night. Sensing opportunity after seeing Tramp walk sadly away after Lady snapped at him, the rat leaves his hiding place and makes his way into the yard through the fence hole. Lady senses it's presence as rain begins to fall, and barks at it, but [[Aunt Sarah]] tells her to shush. [[Tramp]] hears her barking and comes back to her, where she tells him that there's a rat in the house. He then follows him to [[Jim, Jr.]]'s room, before it can harm the baby.\u00a0They engage in a fight, until at one point, it climbs to the top of Jim, Jr.'s crib, with the intent to harm and/or kill him. Tramp chases it off while overturning the crib by accident, waking Jim, Jr., and making him cry. Finally, Tramp manages to corner the Rat behind the couch and kill it, but not before receiving a minor injury from it when it bit his ankle.\n\nHaving been alerted by the commotion, Aunt Sarah arrives and, not seeing the Rat, mistakenly believes that Lady and Tramp had attempted to harm Jim, Jr., promptly locking Lady in the cellar and sending Tramp off to the pound. However, as soon as Jim Dear and Darling return, Lady shows them the dead rat, clearing Tramp's name.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*In an early script, the Rat's name was Herman.\n**Additionally, in the same early script, [[Lady]] was the one who fought the Rat.\n*Most book versions of the film don't show the Rat's appearance at the beginning.\n*There have been several near-identical or similar rats making a cameo in later Disney shows and movies:\n**Many identical rats make various appearances in the ''[[The Wonderful World of Disney|Disneyland]]'' TV episode \"[[The Great Cat Family]]\".\n**There have been similar rats in a cameo appearance in ''[[Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure]],'' when [[Angel (Lady and the Tramp)|Angel]] chases them out of an alley.\n**Many identical rats make various appearances in the 1985 Disney film, ''[[The Black Cauldron]]''.\n**Many identical rats make various appearances in ''[[The Little Mermaid (TV series)|The Little Mermaid]]'' TV episode \"[[Scuttle (episode)|Scuttle]]\"''.\n**The rat made a small cameo in the 1992 Disney film, ''[[Aladdin (film)|Aladdin]]''.\n**The rat made a small cameo in the 1995 Disney film, ''[[Pocahontas (film)|Pocahontas]]''.\n**The rat made a small cameo in some Disney films released in 1996 namely ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' and ''[[Aladdin and the King of Thieves]]''.\n{{Lady and the Tramp}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rat, The}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Rats]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Lady and the Tramp characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]"
