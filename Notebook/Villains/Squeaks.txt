Throughout the film, [[Dinky and Boomer]] try to catch him in an attempt to eat him, but by the end, he transforms into a butterfly and flies away.\n\n\n\n==Role in [[The Fox and the Hound|the film]]==\nSqueaks is a caterpillar who never seems to get a rest from [[Dinky and Boomer]]'s restless hunt. The birds, who both want to devour the caterpillar, are constantly after him up until the last part of the movie when he transforms into a butterfly. Not only do the two birds not recognize him, but they are now unable to eat him. Squeaks is happy he has nothing to run or hide from anymore. Only [[Big Mama]] recognized him in butterfly form as he flew off.\n\nHe is characterized by his big eyes and is recognized by that feature when he was both a caterpillar and a butterfly.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"180\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nFox-disneyscreencaps com-4121.jpg|Squeaks with Dinky\nFox-disneyscreencaps com-4194.jpg\nSqueaksCold.jpg\nFox-disneyscreencaps com-3372.jpg|Squeaks feels cold\nFox-disneyscreencaps com-3477.jpg|Squeaks makes himself warm\nFox-disneyscreencaps com-3494.jpg|Squeaks sleeps in [[Widow Tweed]]'s flower pot\nFox-disneyscreencaps com-8754.jpg|Squeaks turned into a butterfly\nFox-disneyscreencaps com-8795.jpg|Squeaks with [[Big Mama]]\nNovember1st.png|His [[Disneystrology]] page\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Fox and the Hound}}\n[[es:Squeaks]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:The Fox and the Hound characters]]\n[[Category:Caterpillars]]\n[[Category:Butterflies]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
