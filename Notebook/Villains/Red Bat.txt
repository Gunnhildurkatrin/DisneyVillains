He is one of the characters created for the [[Walt Disney Studios|Disney Studio Program]] by [[Dick Kinney]] and Al Hubbard. He appeared in the Fethry comic series, and was first used in the story \"The Health Nut\", published on [[August 2]], [[1964]].\n\n==Role in the comics==\nSince the early [[1970]]s, Fethry has occasionally donned superhero garb and called himself the '''Red Bat''' (not related to the villain of the same name whom [[Mickey Mouse]] faced in his heroic guise as \"Plastic Mickey\"). Occasionally, [[Gloria]], Fethry's girlfriend (created by Gerson Luiz Borlotti Texeira), would team up with the Red Bat as another costumed crime-fighter called the '''Purple Butterfly''' (Borboleta Purpurea). Even Fethry's nephew, [[The Duck Family|Dugan]], has donned a costume and called himself '''Red Bat Junior'''.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Fethry/Red Bat\u00a0wears different colors of the same blouse, depending on which country the story is published in (e.g. in Brazil, his blouse is generally yellow; in the Italian comics, he usually wears a red one; and, in the comic books of [[Egmont Group|Egmont Publishing]], the traditional color of his blouse is pink).\n*It is revealed in \"The Health Nut\" that Fethry/Red Bat\u00a0wears a stocking cap because he was convinced by a self-help book author that one's head is healthier when it is kept hot.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nThe Red Bat.png\nSuperheroesvssupervillains.jpg\nRedBatvsBeagleBoy.jpg\nSuperheroesreunite .jpg\n9383837.jpg\n537373.jpg\nMorcego Vermelho.jpg\nPatodino da Justi\u00e7a.png\nred bat 23.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Alternate Forms]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Superheroes]]"
