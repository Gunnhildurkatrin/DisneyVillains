She is a female tree nymph who resides on [[Phil's Island]]. Unlike the rest of the nymphs she apparently enjoys Phil's company and seems to be in a relationship with him. However, she was upset when Phil forbid Hercules from dancing (considering it \"un-manly\"). She tells him he's just as stubborn as her father, who disapproves of her relationship with a satyr. She has appeared in \"[[Hercules and the Muse of Dance]]\".\n\nSyrinx is named after the mythological nymph who was chased by Pan but turned herself into reeds to escape from him.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Hercules}}\n[[Category:Hercules characters]]\n[[Category:Greek Mythology]]\n[[Category:Greek characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Princesses]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]"
