He is a stuffed teddy bear and [[Penny (The Rescuers)|Penny's]] best friend. His face is based on that of [[Winnie-the-Pooh]]. Penny takes him almost everywhere she goes and loves and cares for him deeply. Though no one might be able to see it, Teddy also loves and cares for Penny and sometimes serves as a source of comfort for her. In the film, Teddy is used as a threat by the evil [[Madame Medusa]] that Penny would never see him again unless she finds the [[Devil's Eye]]. Later, Medusa hides it in his stuffing, but Penny gets him back and they both escape from Medusa's clutches. He is later seen with Penny who has finally been adopted.\n\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nTumblr n9p9diaXj31r3jmn6o1 1280.png\nTumblr nah65absph1r3jmn6o1 1280.png\nTumblr nahae5Kl4i1r3jmn6o1 1280.png\nTumblr nahafnjRIF1r3jmn6o1 1280.png\nTumblr nahifyTorR1r3jmn6o1 1280.png\nTumblr nau2lsL7YD1r3jmn6o1 1280.png\nTumblr nau2o7roHB1r3jmn6o1 1280.png\nMedusa berating Penny.jpg\nTumblr nbbhcwGG3i1r3jmn6o1 1280.png|The [[Devil's Eye]] hidden inside the teddy bear\nTeddy_Bear_(The_Rescuers).png\nTeddy_Bear_2_(The_Rescuers).png\nTeddy_Bear_3_(The_Rescuers).png\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Rescuers}}\n[[Category:The Rescuers characters]]\n[[Category:Bears]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Toys]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:The Rescuers]]\n[[Category:The Rescuers objects]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
