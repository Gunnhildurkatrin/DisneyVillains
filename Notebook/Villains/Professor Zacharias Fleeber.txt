He is voiced by [[Chris Parnell]].\n\n==Role in the Series==\nProfessor Fleeber is considered the world's top expert on sealians. However, as he reveals to [[Princess Amber]] and [[Sofia the First (character)|Princess Sofia]], everything he wrote about sealians is based on stories he heard from sailors who sailed through the Stormy Triangle. When he found out that nobody had actually seen a sealian, he sailed to the Stormy Triangle to find some sealians and learn about them.\n\nProfessor Fleeber makes his debut appearance in \"[[Her Royal Spyness]]\". He first appears when Princess Sofia and Princess Amber arrive on his island. The two girls tell him that their mother was lured away by a sealian and he agrees to help them find her. When he spots some sealians, he supports Sofia's decision to follow them. Suddenly, a storm starts blowing and blows the girls into a ship where they find their mother. Fleeber gets on board and reveals to a frightened Sofia and Amber that the \"sealian\" is really a human. Suddenly, the sealians from earlier arrive and lead them out of the storm. Fleeber meets the other sealians, who agree to let him learn about them.\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Sofia the First}}\n[[Category:Sofia the First characters]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Professors]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
