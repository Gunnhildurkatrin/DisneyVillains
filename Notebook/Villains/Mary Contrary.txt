Barnaby is plotting to kidnap Tom and drown him in the sea by hiring his henchmen, [[Gonzorgo and Roderigo]], to do so. He also tells them to steal Bo Peep's sheep, since they make her more independent in terms of economy.\n\nAfter Tom and Bo Peep's sheep are kidnapped, Mary is worried about the economy. She plans to sell the furniture to help the children. Knowing she has no other choices, she reluctantly decides to marry Barnaby.\n\nBarnaby invites the gypsies to the celebration to perform dances. One is revealed to be Tom in disguise. He reveals Barnaby's plot and the whole village turns against him.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Mary's character is based on the character from the nursery rhyme \"Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary\".\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nBabesintoyland-05.jpg\nMary.Babes in Toyland.png\nTom and Mary hugging.png\nBabes 003.png\n7979953138_22093aa024_z.jpg\n803df3695d8a66c627674cb265fab6e4.jpg\n7253_1.jpg\ntnjhgtrw45.jpg\nImagesCAHDVZ14.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Contrary, Mary}}\n\n{{Babes in Toyland}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Babes in Toyland characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Deuteragonists]]"
