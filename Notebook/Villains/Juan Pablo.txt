He is commonly seen wearing blue tights with grey shoes, black tank top and yellow armbands.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Juan Pablo works with [[Community Sue]], but has not interacted with her yet.\n*He has a habit of saying \"wow\" a lot, similar to actor [[Owen Wilson]].\n*In \"[[Valentine's Dance]]\", Sue claims that the Community Center does not have any money.
