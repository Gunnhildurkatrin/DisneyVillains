He is an eccentric, deformed child who becomes responsible for revealing [[Victor Frankenstein]]'s secret of resurrection to the other schoolchildren.\n\n==Description==\nEdgar \u201cE\u201d Gore is a 10-year-old needy misfit who doesn't have friends but is desperate to be Victor's partner for the science fair. In his attempts to be accepted \u2018E\u2019 tends to mess things up and often fails to think before he speaks. Even though \u2018E\u2019 promises not to tell Victor\u2019s secret, he accidentally spills the beans.\n== Appearances ==\n\n=== ''[[Frankenweenie]]'' ===\n==Trivia==\n*Edgar is a reference to the [[wikipedia:Igor_(fictional_character)|Igor]] stock character popular in the horror genre.\n*Atticus Shaffer has stated that he patterned Edgar's voice after that of iconic film actor Peter Lorre, keeping with pop-cultural conventions of associating Lorre with the Igor archetype despite never actually playing him.\n*In the film, when Edgar revives a dead rat it mutates into a [[wikipedia:Lycanthropy|lycanthropic]] rat-creature which has features similar to a [[wikipedia:Werewolf|werewolf]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nEdgar Gore.png\nTumblr n4klewHaik1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\nFRANK 09 12 12 Night.Were-Rat.Holly.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Frankenweenie}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Frankenweenie characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Students]]"
