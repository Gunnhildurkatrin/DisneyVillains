He is a young witch and one of [[Luz Noceda|Luz's]] friends on [[The Boiling Isles]].\n\n==Background==\nGus is an Illusion student who attends [[Hexside School of Magic and Demonics]] alongside [[Willow Park]] and [[Luz Noceda]], who are both friends. He also happens to be somewhat of an expert on human culture, and is the President of the Human Appreciation Society at his school. However, his knowledge on humans is often inaccurate. For example, he believed humans had gills and wore braces to make them magnetic. Gus is in a few grades higher above his friends.\n\n=== Personality ===\nGus is an enthusiastic youth who loves showing off his capabilities and share his ideas. He can be slightly belligerent and a little unfocused, but knows what is important to him. He is constantly seeking approval from his peers, implying that he is slightly self conscientious. In \"[[Agony of a Witch]]\" he uses the Oracle Sphere to see what the best version of himself is and is satisfyingly told that he is \"always [his] best self\".\n\n===Physical appearance===\nGus is slightly shorter than Willow and Luz with dark skin and dark brown hair with lighter shades. Like all the witches and Wizards on the boiling isles, he has pointy ears. When attending school, Gus wears a gray tunic with a dark gray belt, hoodie, and boots. As part of the Illusion track, the color of his sleeves and leggings are light blue.\n\nIn season two, Gus undergoes witch puberty. He is now roughly the same height as Willow, and his features are noticeably sharper, including his hair.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\n*'''Magic:''' Gus is adept in magic, and Like all witches and wizards, he gets his magic from a sack of magic bile attached to his heart.\n**'''Illusion magic:''' As an illusion student, Gus specializes in casting illusion based magic.\n*'''Staff:''' During Palisman Pairing Day, Gus adopted a chameleon palisman.\n\nWillow adopted a bird/bee hybrid palisman named Clover, who became her staff. Clower approached her for her desire to become strong and wise to protect her friends, and harm those who wish to hurt them.\n\n==Role in the [[The Owl House|series]]==\n===Season One===\n[[File:I Was a Teenage Abomination 21.png|left|thumb|250px|Gus and Willow with their new friend Luz.]]\nGus Porter is a prodigy on the illusion track who was \"moved up a couple grades\". Due to this, he frequently creates illusions of himself to attend his classes while he moves freely around [[Hexside School of Magic and Demonics]]. He is friends with the slightly older [[Willow Park]] due to them sharing a similar status of them being outcasts (Willow because of her introverted personality and Gus for being younger than his peers). One day at school, Willow shows up with the human [[Luz Noceda]]. This greatly impresses Gus who just so happens to be obsessed with human culture and the president of the Human Appreciation Society (H.A.S.). Gus helps Luz and Willow out when [[Amity Blight]] attempts to expose them and get them in trouble while also learning what a high five is.\n\nGus begins to become close with Luz and he and Willow begin to go on various adventures with her. He learns more about Willow and her past with Amity. While Luz comments that Willow is a great witch, Gus concurs; glad that he is there for support for her two friends. While at a H.A.S. meeting, Gus is challenged by a boy named Mattholomule for the presidency of the club. Knowing that he is a phony and not wanting to lose his presidency of the club, Gus decides to bring Luz to school to show him up; not informing her that she has been banned from the school. After getting caught in another dangerous adventure, which had them ending up in the detention room full of monsters, Gus willingly gave up his presidency so that Luz could still get accepted into Hexside after [[Eda Clawthorne]] went out of her way to help her get into the school.\n[[File:Agony of a Witch (47).png|thumb|250px|Gus gets approval from his own illusion.]]\nGus was thrilled to having Luz attend Hexside as this meant him and Willow could be closer to her. He slowly begins to admire and appreciate the people from the [[The Owl House (location)|Owl House]] itself. He at first was at odds with [[King (The Owl House)|King]] when he attempts to steal Luz away from him and Willow out of jealousy, but by the end of their adventure, Gus becomes good friends with him and even gives him some emotional support when he realizes that he has stage fright. He also begins to admire Eda as just like Luz, he things she is amazing and a great witch, and also finds [[Hooty]] somewhat humorous, though he quickly gets tired of him. Gus helps Luz with trying to cure and rescue Eda from her curse. While they initially fail with trying to steal an old relic, Gus and Willow help Luz afterwards by convincing numerous spectators that executing Eda is wrong.\n\n===Season Two===\nIn the season two episode \"[[Hunting Palismen]]\", Gus gains his own Palisman, which takes the form of a blue chameleon. While his father wants him to become a master illusionist, Gus considers that too easy, so he declares that he wants to become the Boiling Isles' ambassador to the Human Realm and to reestablish contact with the giraffes.\n\n==Relationships==\n===[[Luz Noceda]]===\n[[File:Hooty's Moving Hassle (57).png|thumb|250px|Gus performing magic with Luz and Willow.]]\nGus sees Luz as the most fascinating person to have ever set foot on the Boiling Isles, mostly because she is a human. While he occasionally views her as a specimen to examine, he does see her as a genuine friend. His obliviousness of human culture is seen as adorable by Luz. Gus will occasionally get on her nerves, but always manages to get back onto her good side. He is willing to stand up for her and as seen in \"[[Something Ventured, Someone Framed]]\" when he took the blame for destroying the detention room; losing his place in the Human Appreciation Society.\n\n===[[Willow Park]]===\nGus has known Willow for quite some time and both bond over their mutual designation of being outcasts. He holds a special sibling-like relationship with her and defends her from the usual insults that she receives. It is slightly implied that Gus holds her in high regard as when Luz told Willow that she is the greatest witch she knows before apologizing to a present Gus, he tells her \"I know what I'm about\".\n\n===Owl House Inhabitants===\n[[File:Understanding Willow (125).png|thumb|250px|Gus does a piece on Hooty.]]\nCollectively, Gus finds the people within the [[The Owl House (location)|Owl House]] amusing. Much like Luz, he apparently admires [[Eda Clawthorne|Eda]] for her notoriety and understands why Luz looks up to her so much. He feels similarly about King, though in \"[[Really Small Problems]]\", he was upset with him when he attempted to remove him and Willow so that he can have Luz to himself. However, by the end, he and Willow make amends and start to consider him one of their friends. In \"[[Understanding Willow]]\", Gus found [[Hooty]] more interesting than either Eda or King, but by the end of the episode sees that he is annoying and unfocused.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Gus is the first character to undergo a dramatic change between seasons. This is so as to accommodate Isaac Ryan Brown's real life puberty as his voice deepened between seasons.\n*In \"[[Enchanting Grom Fright]]\", Gus is revealed to have coulrophobia, the fear of clowns.\n\n==External links==\n\n*[[w:c:theowlhouse:Gus|Gus]] on [[w:c:theowlhouse|The Owl House Wiki]]\n{{The Owl House}}\n[[pt-br:Gus Porter]]\n[[Category:The Owl House characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Witches]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
