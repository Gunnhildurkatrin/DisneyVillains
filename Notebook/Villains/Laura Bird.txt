Additionally, she seems to be a good teacher, even though many students don't really like her.\n\n==Appearance==\nLaura Bird wears average clothes, usually in a professional manner due to her being a teacher. She has her hair mid-length and she looks in her late 40s - mid 50s.\n\n{{Suite Life}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bird, Laura}}\n[[Category:The Suite Life characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Schoolteachers]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]"
