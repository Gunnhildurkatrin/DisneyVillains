She is the oldest daughter of [[Queen Emmaline]] as well as [[Oona]]'s older sister.\n\n==Role in the Series==\nCora is first seen outside [[Oona]]'s shipwreck hideout with Sven and [[Sofia the First (character)|Sofia]], who she takes an instant shine to. She then tells Oona that their mother, [[Queen Emmaline]], wants them to go back to the Merroway Cove throne room. Queen Emmaline says that a human vessel is in the cove and [[Plank]] suggests that Emmaline remove the Floating Palace out of the Cove. Cora agrees with Plank because she thinks that humans are dangerous and that they might harm Oona and her family. When Sofia admits that she's a human and that the ship is her family's ship, Cora starts acting negatively towards Sofia despite Oona's protests on her friend's behalf, though, as her mother, she doesn't act as antagonistic toward Sofia as Plank does because of her sister's obvious affection for Sofia.\n\nWhen Oona is captured by the [[The Sea Monster|Cedric the Sea Monster]], Sofia goes back to Queen Emmaline and tells her about Oona. Cora, Plank, and Emmaline all think that Sofia is lying and that her human family has kidnapped Oona after Plank made these accusations despite the fact that there is evidence against it, like the fact that Sofia and Oona are friends and the fact that Sofia knows that such a thing would anger Emmaline to the point where she would sink the ship with her family on board in retribution. Sofia is given until sundown to get Oona back and return her to Merroway Cove before Emmaline uses her Trident to sink the Floating Palace. After time is up and Oona doesn't come back, the Queen and Plank go up to the surface and conjure up a storm to sink the Floating Palace. Cora asks her mother if she can come, but the Queen says that it's too dangerous and that she must stay underwater.\n\n[[Ariel]] helps Sofia to realize that both humans and merpeople care about their families and they must work together to save both. Sofia realizes that she needs Cora's help to save Oona. At first, Cora doesn't believe that Oona was taken by the Sea Monster until [[Sven (Sofia the First)|Sven]] says that he saw it with both his eyes. Sofia says that the only way to save Oona is by working together. Cora then believes Sofia's story and goes with her to the cave where the Sea Monster was. When Sofia gets Oona's comb, she throws it overboard where Cora is waiting, then Cora raises the comb and chants \"Waters rise at my command!\" Then a huge wave blasts the Sea Monster out of the cove and Oona is rescued. Oona then thanks Cora for rescuing her and afterward she, Emmaline, and Plank all apologize to Sofia for their behavior.\n\nAt the very end, [[Princess Amber|Amber]] was talking to Cora, mentioning about her seashell headband, until [[Prince James|James]] does a cannonball into the water, to Amber's annoyance.\n\nCora makes a nonspeaking appearance at the end of the episode, \"[[Cool Hand Fluke]]\" as she watches her sister's band perform at the party in the mermaids' honor.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Like a lot of older siblings, Cora likes pushing her little sister's buttons in a way Oona doesn't find funny.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\">\nThe-Floating-Palace-38.png|Here's Ariel, Sofia, and Cora on her mom's throne\nThe-Floating-Palace-40.png|Cora holding Oona's comb\nQueen emmaline and her daughters.jpg\nCora using the Current Conch.JPG\nCora on her mother's throne.JPG\nOona-Cora 2.JPG\nCora holding the Trident.JPG\nCora and Oona try to stop the sea twister.JPG\nQueen Emmaline-Cora-Oona.JPG\nOnna and Cora hug their mother.JPG\nCora and Oona perform in the water show.JPG\n</gallery>\n\n{{Sofia the First}}\n[[Category:Sofia the First characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Mermaids]]\n[[Category:Princesses]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Character stubs]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Hybrids]]"
