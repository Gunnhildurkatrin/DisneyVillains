She is voiced by [[April Winchell]].\n\n==Personality==\nStacy doesn't seem to have a positive relationship with her niece, as she forgets her name and doesn't really care about how she feels.\n\nShe also seems serious and firm when it comes to business, as she wanted to get to [[Los Angeles]] as soon as Mertle's half-birthday party ends, and again to know about how long the competition will last because she has a get to yoga class in five in the morning.\n\nStacy does have a sense of appreciation when it comes to talent, as she was impressed by the magic act and wanted [[Stitch]], then later [[Pleakley]], and then later [[Houdini]] to be a star.\n\n==Role in the [[Lilo & Stitch: The Series|series]]==\nStacy first appears in \"[[Houdini (episode)|Houdini]]\". She didn't seem eager to attend Mertle's half-birthday party. However, upon seeing Stitch's \"magic act\", she phoned someone named Barry, saying that she found someone to be his special star, and gave [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] her business card. She then wanted Stitch to make the lighthouse disappear, but given that his magic wasn't real and Houdini did all the stunts, Lilo had Pleakley stall for time. Just he was about to make the lighthouse vanish, Lilo, Stitch, and Houdini came back in time for the latter to make the lighthouse invisible. Stacy gave Pleakley a contract to sign, but Lilo revealed Houdini did all the stunts. Impressed, Stacy decided to let Houdini become a star.\n\nStacy appears again in \"[[Spike (episode)|Spike]]\" where she competed in the Ohana-Rama with her niece and sister. However, she didn't know Mertle was cheating with [[Elena, Teresa, and Yuki|Teresa]]'s help.\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Aunts]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Producers]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
