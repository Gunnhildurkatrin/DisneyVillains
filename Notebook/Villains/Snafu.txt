'''Experiment 120''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]]. He\u00a0is designed to discombobulate\u00a0enemy plans by any possible means; he will also thwart any attempt\u00a0to capture him, and thus can only be caught by accident.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nSnafu is a mischievous, cunning, and conniving experiment. This is proven when he turned all of [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Stitch]]'s plans to save the imprisoned experiments in [[Gantu's Ship|Gantu's ship]] against them, and also sabotaged [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]]'s plans to turn all the remaining experiments from good to bad by swapping the tape of [[Angel]]'s song with Gantu's karaoke tape. However, his desire to foil plans seems to come from his programming, and he is initially unable to distinguish friend and foe.\n\nSnafu seems to be somewhat sadistic, as he laughs every time he manages to foil a plan. Since he was programmed to sabotage enemy plans by any possible means, he is very resourceful, with even Jumba acknowledging that he can only be caught by accident. The only thing Snafu hates the most is having his own sabotage backfire on him. However, after Stitch revealed\u00a0his love to Angel, Snafu became\u00a0touched while shedding\u00a0tears and changed\u00a0his heart.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nSnafu is a small dark-green cephalopod-like experiment with a roughly reptilian face and white eyes. He has small limbs and a tail, black markings on his back, and six telescoping prehensile tentacles on his large dome head.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nSnafu is a master at foiling any and all complex plans. He is also highly elusive due to his plan-foiling skills, and can only be captured or defeated by accident. He often uses his tentacles for mobility or gripping objects. His eyes can serve as magnifying lenses and has an incredible ability to tamper with machines.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment 120 was the 120th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to foil any and all enemy plans at whatever cost.\u00a0120 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.\n\nAt an unknown point after this, Experiment 120's pod was found by Jumba and kept in a shoebox under his bed.\n\n[[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] discovered 120's pod in the shoebox under [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]]'s bed when she was searching his room for any unactivated experiments to use in a rescue mission to\u00a0free [[Stitch]]'s cousins on [[Gantu's Ship|Gantu's ship]].\n\nJumba warned Lilo not to use 120, as he was the worst experiment to activate when making complex rescue missions. However, at that moment, [[Pleakley]]\u00a0came in with a hose and sprayed water everywhere, activating 120. He then ripped up the blueprints for Lilo and Stitch's rescue mission and escaped through the pet flap.\n\n120 remained near the [[Lilo's House|Pelekais' house]], where he cleverly spied on Lilo, Stitch, and the experiments' plans for the rescue mission and sabotaged their obstacle course.\n\n120 later foiled [[Gantu]]'s plan to revert all of the rehabilitated experiments to evil by swapping the tape of [[Angel]]'s song with Gantu's karaoke tape. When\u00a0the tape was\u00a0played by [[Reuben|Experiment 625]] driving a stolen ice cream truck, everyone\u00a0on Kauai laughed in amusement, much to Gantu's embarrassment.\n\nWhen Lilo, Stitch and the experiments launched a rescue mission on the ship, 120 tricked [[Sample]] into imitating the ship's alarm to alert Gantu. 120 then rewired the ship's prison, causing it to trap Lilo and the rescue team.\n\nHowever, 120, named Snafu,\u00a0did not count on the prison trapping him as well. Though after hearing Stitch confess his love for Angel, Snafu cried because it really touched his heart, causing him to turn from bad to good.\n\nFortunately, Snafu was freed by Angel and Stitch, who also freed Lilo and the captive experiments in their containment orbs. Snafu then foiled Gantu before the latter could recapture the experiments and escaped the ship with Lilo, the rescue team, and the released experiments.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nThe first 624 experiments, including Snafu, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]] and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nIt is unknown whether or not Snafu participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]].\n\nThe Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n==Trivia==\n*Snafu is named after the acronym SNAFU ('''S'''ituation '''N'''ormal '''A'''ll '''F'''ouled '''U'''p).\n*Snafu is one of the few\u00a0experiments to not be given a specific purpose, as a new place to reside and use his abilities for good rather than bad. It is likely, due to his expertise with mechanics, that he might be best suited for combat demolitions and undercover sabotage.\n*Snafu's [[Experiment Pods|pod]]\u00a0color is purple.\n*The [[Experiment Pod Container]] describes Snafu as: \"Experiment 120. Primary function: Discombobulates enemy plans.\"\n*Snafu is one of the few experiments to not appear in the group photo at the end of ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''.\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Spies]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]"
