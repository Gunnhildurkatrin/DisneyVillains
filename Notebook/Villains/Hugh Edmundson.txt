"[[File:Hugh_Edmonson.png|thumb]]'''Hugh Edmundson''' is a green French Fish who goes to [[Freshwater High]].\n==Personal Life==\nHugh Edmundson once asked [[Bea Goldfishberg|Bea]] to go to the National Kelp Museum together (\"[[Doris Flores Gorgeous]]\"). When [[Milo the Fish|Milo]] started recycling at Freshwater, he somehow took off Hugh Edmundson's mouth and turned his frown into a smile (\"Legend of the Earth Troll\"). In the \"Potatoes for Winter\" play, Hugh Edmundon played as one of the citizens of El Gratin. He was one of the bakers of the town, the other being [[Bo Gregory]] (\"[[Fish School Musical]]\").\n\nHugh Edmundson tried auditioning for the Hokey Poke commercial, although he failed to get the part and swam away, crying (\"[[Bea's Commercial]]\"). When [[Oscar the Fish|Oscar]] got perfect scores in French class after he got hold of [[Steve Jackson]]'s hair gel, Hugh Edmundson congratulated him (\"[[Hairanoid]]\").\n\n==Background Information==\n===Appearances===\n*\"[[Doris Flores Gorgeous]]\" (First appearance)\n*\"[[Milo Gets a Ninja]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Big Fish]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Dollars and Fish]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Legend of the Earth Troll]]\"\n*\"[[Pamela Hamster Returns]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Riding in Cars with Fish]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Mascotastrophe]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Diary of a Lost Fish]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Good Morning, Freshwater]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Good Times at PuPu Goodtimes]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Fish School Musical]]\"\n*\"[[Employee Discount]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Fish Talent Show]]\" (Non-speaking cameo)\n*\"[[Bea's Commercial]]\"\n*\"[[Hairanoid]]\"\n*\"[[So-fish-ticated]]\"\n\n{{Fish Hooks}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hugh Edmundson}}\n[[Category:Fish Hooks characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Fish]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:French characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
