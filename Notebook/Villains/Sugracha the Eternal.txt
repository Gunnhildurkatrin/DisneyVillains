At one point on their journey, however, she, [[Tromus]],\u00a0and [[Mother Gothel]] decided to betray Demanitus by siding with\u00a0[[Zhan Tiri]]\u00a0as her new loyal servants, after they freed her.\n\nAt some point, Demanitus defeated Zhan Tiri and imprisoned her in the [[Demanitus Device]] by sending her to the Lost Realm.\n\n===Personality===\nAs Mrs. Sugarby, Sugracha disguises her true wicked and deceiving nature, with a kind one that would allow people to trust her.\n\n===Powers and Abilities===\nAs a wicked spirit, she is capable of using dark magic, like a witch or sorceress.\n\n==Role in the [[Tangled: The Series|series]]==\nIn \"[[Painter's Block]]\", she was freed from the prison when the Demanitus Device was used to once again end her master's blizzard. She utilized her freedom to find a way to free her master from her imprisonment; which came in the form of Corona's new art gallery. As there were many people that want their artwork to be placed in the gallery, she opened up an art class for those who want to improve; while secretly gathering her candidates that would allow her to perform a spell that would free her master.\n\nIn order for the spell to work, she needed five people to paint the giant tree at Janus Point exactly on each canvas. If one is painted differently, the spell wouldn't work. So to make sure that doesn't happen she puts her art students under a hypnotism spell.\n\nShe successfully hypnotized [[Feldspar]], [[Ulf]], [[Lance Strongbow]], [[Freidborg]], and [[Rapunzel]] to help her finish the paintings. When the spell was almost completed, [[Flynn Rider|Eugene]] and [[Cassandra (Tangled)|Cassandra]] arrived in time to stop her. With Eugene's encouragement, Rapunzel overcame the hypnotism and destroyed the canvas. As the portal to free Zhan Tiri was closing, she was kicked into the portal by [[Fidella]].\n\n==Trivia==\n*The line that Sugracha uses as she slowly puts Rapunzel under her spell is \"Life is full of tough choices,\" a quote that is said by [[Ursula]] in ''[[The Little Mermaid]]''.\n**While Sugracha says those lines to put her students under her control, she makes a tapping sound with her cane. Should her victims make the same kind of sound it would strengthen the hold that the evil spirit has on their mind.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nDemanitus Device 8.jpg|Her mark glowing, as she is being freed from her prison\nSugracha Freed.png|Freed\nPainter's Block - Sugracha 02.png\nPainter's Block - Mrs Sugarby and Rapunzel.jpg|Mrs Sugarby  teaching Rapunzel to paint\nPainter's Block - Rapunzel 06.jpg\nPainter's Block 8.png|Placing Rapunzel under her spell\nPainter's Block - Eternel Tree Painting.png\nPainter's Block - Lance.jpg\nPainter's Block - Sugracha 00.png\nPainter's Block - Rapunzel 03.jpg\nPainter's Block 19.jpg|Mrs. Sugarby turning back into ''Sugracha the Eternal''\nPainter's Block 17.jpg\nSugracha yells no.jpg\nPainter's Block 25.jpg|Sugracha calling out to her master\nDemanitusPupils.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Tangled}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Tangled characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Spirits]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
