He is a skeleton taxi driver who has a habit to make jokes. In ''[[Return to Halloweentown]]'', it was revealed that his full name is '''Benjamin C. Deadman'''. He took a liking to being called Benny after [[Marnie Piper|Marnie]] called him it when she traveled back in time to the founding of [[Halloweentown (place)|Halloweentown]]. According to Marnie, Benny has a rather poor sense of humor; his jokes are usual skeleton-related, but no one actually finds them funny, though they laugh to be kind.\n\n[[Kalabar]] temporarily corrupted him, so he could kidnap the Piper children to be used as ransom to ensure [[Aggie Cromwell]] did not interfere with his plans. However, [[Sophie Piper|Sophie]] sicced a dog on him, forcing Benny to flee. He was later freed of Kalabar's influence and bid farewell to the Pipers when they returned home to the mortal world.\n\n[[File:Benny Grey Spell.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Benny under the Grey Spell.]]\nUnder the Grey Spell, Benny becomes a human that is all skin and bones. After being reverted to normal by [[Dylan Piper|Dylan]], he said \"Talk about going on a crash diet!\" This could imply he crashes a lot (on purpose) or he was referencing the fact he turned back into a skeleton.\n\nIn ''[[Return to Halloweentown]]'', Benny served as Marnie and Dylan's lift to their new home at [[Witch University]]. He mentioned the 1000 year anniversary of Halloweentown to them, wishing them a pleasant time. A past version of himself gave Marnie a lift to Cromwell Castle after she \"predicted\" that he will become a taxi driver in the future.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The letters of Benny's full name are in alphabetical order (B,C,D).\n*He makes an appearance in all the movies that actually feature Halloweentown itself; he did not appear only in ''[[Halloweentown High]]''.\n*He is possibly as old, or older than, Agatha Cromwell and Professor Periwinkle.\n*Since he has been around for centuries, he considers everyone a kid.\n\n{{Halloweentown}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Skeletons]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]\n[[Category:Halloweentown characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel Original Movie Characters]]"
