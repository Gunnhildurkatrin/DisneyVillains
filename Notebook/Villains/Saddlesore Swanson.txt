He would be a resident of [[Chickapin Hill]] following its flooding and live amongst its critters.\n\n=== Development History ===\nSaddlesore Swanson was created for the attraction [[America Sings]] in [[Tomorrowland]] where he was one of its Old West characters.  When America Sings closed in the 1980s, he was amongst the audio-animatronics moved to the new [[Critter Country]] attraction, [[Splash Mountain]].\n\nAs of [[2020]], Splash Mountain has been announced for closure due to its [[Song of the South|history of embellishing racism]].  It is unknown at time of writing what will become of Saddlesore's figure.\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n=== America Sings ===\nSaddlesore appeared in the third act of America Sings, themed around the old west.  The turkey had the third musical number in this scene, singing, \"''The Old Chisholm Trail''\" where he recounted his troubles.\n\n=== Splash Mountain ===\nSaddlesore appeared in Splash Mountain albeit with a few design alterations.  He lost his spurs, was given a straw-hat in-favour of his cowboy hat, and had a guitar made from a turtle shell.  He could be found in the subterranean, \"Laughin' Place\" singing [[Everybody's Got a Laughing Place|''Everybody's got a laughing place'']] along with a [[Singing Geese|singing goose]] and a chicken.\n\n[[Category:Turkeys]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Splash Mountain characters]]\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Cowboys & cowgirls]]\n[[Category:America Sings]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]"
