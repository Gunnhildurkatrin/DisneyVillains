The island is completely inhabited by dragons, with sea serpents around its shores. The draconian magic enchants the island, turning it brightly volcanic with multicolored smoke. When [[Princess Ivy]] tries to destroy Sofia's amulet and claim the kingdom for herself, [[Sofia the First (character)|Sofia]], [[Princess Amber|Amber]], and [[Cedric the Sorcerer|Cedric]] fly to the island for help. Despite their intimidating home, the dragons are friendly and enjoy the company, happy to fly from their island to interact with humans.\n\nThen, Everburn and his crew make a return appearance in \"[[The Secret Library: Tale of the Eternal Torch]]\" in a feud against Aqualina and her [[Sea Monsters|sea serpents]] who want to turn the Palisades into a water world. But with some help from Sofia and [[Prince James|James]], the dragons learn to share the land and make peace with the serpents, creating a half-fire, half-water island, the Misty Palisades.\n\n==Notable Dragons==\n*'''Everburn''' - ([[Oliver Platt]]) Enchancia's eldest dragon and former self-appointed leader of the Dragon group.

He judged school bands in \"[[The Princess Prodigy]]\".\n*'''Smokelee''' - ([[Sam Riegel]]) Member of the band.
