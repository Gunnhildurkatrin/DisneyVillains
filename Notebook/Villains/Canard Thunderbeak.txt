He was the original leader and team captain of the Mighty Ducks before being pulled into Dimensional Limbo. While following [[Lord Dragaunus|Dragaunus]] through a dimensional gateway, Canard sacrificed himself when the Saurians released an electromagnetic worm on the Aerowing. Before he did, he gave the mask of Drake DuCaine to Wildwing and told him to be the team captain. (Much to Wildwing's dismay.)  To this day, as far as the Mighty Ducks know, Canard is still trapped in dimensional limbo. He was a great leader and a great friend. Wildwing believes Canard is still alive and swears he will find him.\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nThe First Face-Off Part 1 (2).jpg\nVlcshot-2016-10-03-07h09m27s976.png\nVlcshot-2016-10-03-07h10m58s096.png\nSnapshot-2016-10-03-08h00m10s679.png\nSnapshot-2016-10-03-08h00m30s040.png|[[Chameleon]] impersonating Canard\nSnapshot-2016-10-03-08h00m35s434.png\nVlcpic-2016-10-03-10h09m46s809.png\nI found it.png|\"I found it Wildwing!\"\nBest Friends.png|Best Friends\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n<references/>{{DEFAULTSORT:Thunderbeak, Canard}}\n\n{{The Mighty Ducks}}\n[[Category:The Mighty Ducks]]\n[[Category:Mighty Ducks (TV show) characters]]\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Superheroes]]\n[[Category:Presumably Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
