He has a grand estimation of his own worth but is a tireless servant to the throne, ensuring that all runs smoothly in the empire. If only humans weren't so fallible! He has weight and dignity despite his diminutive stature \u201d|Official character description from ''Kingdom of the Sun'' production notes}}\n\n'''Huaca''' was a\u00a0talking talisman who was an ally of [[Yzma]], and a considered antagonist in ''Kingdom of the Sun'', the alternate working title of ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]''. \n\nHe was once [[Kuzco|Manco]]'s advisor, but after getting tired of the young emperor refusing to listen to him, he went to work with the sorceress. He also appeared to be a stickler for tradition as in one deleted scene, he reprimanded Pacha, who switched places with Manco early on, for allowing a Llama to go free instead of letting it be sacrificed to bring the sun. The sun then comes up anyway.\n\nWhile he didn't appear in the film when the film was retooled into ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]'', a reference to him is placed at the beginning of the dinner scene, where his likeness is used in the statue holding the candles.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Sting wrote a song for him that was a parody of \"Why Can't a Woman Be More Like a Man?\" from My Fair Lady, entitled \"Why Can't a Human Be More Like a Rock?\"\n*Prior to the casting of [[Harvey Fierstein]], Gary Marshall and [[Peter Ustinov]] were considered to voice him.\n*Huaca's name means an object that is honored in the Quechuan languages of South America.\n\n==Test animation==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nKingdom of the Sun- Huaca Test 1-2\nKingdom of the Sun- Huaca Test 2-2\n</gallery>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nHucua Sketch (2).jpg|Huaca with [[Kuzco|Manco]] by Barry Johnson\nHucua Sketch (3).jpg\nHucua Sketch (4).jpg\nHucua Sketch (5).jpg\nHucua Sketch (6).jpg\nKingdom of the Sun Yzma Pencil Test.png\nHucua Pencil Test.jpg\nHucua Sketch (7).jpg\nHucua Sketch (8).jpg\nHucua Sketch (9).jpg\nHucua Sketch (10).jpg|Huaca gets angry at [[Pacha]] for impersonating the Emperor\nHucua Early Development.jpg|Early concepts for Huaca\nHucua Early Development (2).jpg|Early concepts for Huaca by Peter de S\u00e8ve\nHucua Model Sheet.jpg\nHucua Model Sheet (2).jpg\nHucua Model Sheet (3).jpg\nHucua Poses.jpg\nHucua Color Study.jpg|Huaca color study\nHucua Color Study (2).jpg\nHucua Color Key.jpg\nHucua Sketch (12).jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Emperor's New Groove}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Deleted characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:The Emperor's New Groove characters]]\n[[Category:The Emperor's New Groove objects]]\n\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]\n[[Category:Peruvian characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]"
