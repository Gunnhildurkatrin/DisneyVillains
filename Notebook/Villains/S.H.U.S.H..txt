Gander Hooter]]. S.H.U.S.H. is usually shown handling cases involving the terrorist attacks led by [[F.O.W.L.]].\n\nS.H.U.S.H. agents are known for their meticulous by-the-book methods and are careful to abide by the law. When their brand of justice is proven ineffective, Director Hooter will call in [[Darkwing Duck (character)|Darkwing Duck]], whose vigilante style and \"off the payroll\" status proves beneficial.\n\nDarkwing has, more often than not, been utilized as a cheap delivery service. He will protect S.H.U.S.H. packages with his life, only to find out the contents contained things like a stapler or a cassette of Greatest Polka Hits.\n\nS.H.U.S.H. returns in the ''[[DuckTales (2017 series)|DuckTales]]'' episode \"[[From the Confidential Casefiles of Agent 22!]]\", as the former employer of [[Bentina Beakley]] and [[Scrooge McDuck]], under the direction of [[Ludwig Von Drake]].\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nSHUSHlogo.jpg|The S.H.U.S.H. emblem\nHooter.jpg|J.
