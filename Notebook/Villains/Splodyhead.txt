'''Experiment 619''' and '''Splody''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]]. He is designed to attack using fiery plasma blasts from his nozzle-like nose; he can also pitch softballs similarly. His one true place is lighting tiki torches at the luau.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nSplodyhead is an experiment controlled by his fiery disposition: he is fierce, greatly dislikes the water, and is shown to be hotheaded when provoked. He is loyal to his friends, but he does have an attitude. He knows when he's outnumbered, so he will often pick off his victims one by one. He likes his food \"well done\", as [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] puts it, which usually means he burns or melts it. While he cannot talk (though he does understand what people are saying), he can still be intelligent and polite, as shown in \"[[Slushy (episode)|Slushy]]\" when he thanked [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] for fixing his thermostat so he wouldn't overheat. He is known to be hostile and apparently shares a grudge with [[Slushy]] due to his opposing elemental power, but they resolved it in \"[[Spike (episode)|Spike]]\".\n\n===Physical appearance===\nSplodyhead is a small, red six-legged (two arms and four hind tentacles) dragon-like experiment. His head has a hole-like nose and fangs sticking out from his mouth, two red antennae, a red and purple striped horn on his head with brick-red markings on his forehead and back, dark blue eyes with purple-red spots around them, and two short red ears. He has red fur with a sort of pink fur on his underbelly extending to his mouth, and a short tail. Splodyhead is shown to have a turquoise tongue.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nSplodyhead can fire plasma blasts from his hole-like nose. In \"[[Slushy (episode)|Slushy]]\", this power is expanded upon, showing that he can channel these plasma blasts in streams of fire and/or shoot flames, which he can manipulate into types of shields. He can also substitute almost any solid sphere (such as softballs) for his plasma balls if inserted into his nozzle/nose, and blast it with just as much force. Splodyhead can propel himself by shooting out his plasma streams similar to a rocket. \n\nThe ''Stitch!'' anime also revealed that Splodyhead can lob spheres made out of a horrible stench after being modified by [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]. \n\nIn addition to his plasma-based abilities, Splodyhead is able to climb and maneuver around steep walls and cliffs.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment 619 was the 619th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to use his fiery plasma blasts to cause massive chaos and damage. 619 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.\n\n619's pod was eventually discovered by [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]], who were all seen competing for the pod as they chased after it while causing an outdoor ruckus, unintentionally disrupting a wedding ceremony at one point.\n\nDuring their struggle, a seagull snatched the pod and took it back to its nest on a cliff face near the Forbidden Island of {{WikipediaLink|Niihau|Ni\u02bbihau}}. When the gull was unable to peck 619's pod open, it kicked it out of the nest in anger. The pod landed in the ocean, activating 619, who quickly jumped ashore and then proceeded to take over the seagull's nest.\n\nLater, 619 spotted Lilo, Stitch, [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben|Experiment 625]], and Gantu arriving on the island for him. Becoming extremely hostile, he attacked and destroyed both factions' campsites, which put the six in jeopardy. Stitch and Gantu, believing the other one was at fault, had a short-lived battle with each other before Lilo intervened to break it up.\n\nWhen the two factions saw 619, whom Lilo named Splodyhead, invading the nest, he attacked with raining plasma blasts, forcing Lilo, Stitch, Jumba, Pleakley, Reuben, and Gantu to take cover. Using his plasma attacks, Splodyhead managed to keep the six trapped, yet refused to come down to finish them off, due to him being outnumbered.\n\nWhile Splodyhead waited to pick them off one by one, Stitch and Gantu resumed their conflict, since they both thought the other one was evil. Realizing what Splodyhead was up to, Lilo told the two rivals that if they wanted to be rescued, they would have to put their differences aside and try to work together. Stitch and Gantu initially refused, but after both factions took a vote, Lilo was nominated to lead them.\n\nAs more time elapsed, the six built and sent out a decoy raft as bait, which Splodyhead targeted and blew up. Convinced the danger was over, Splodyhead left the nest, thus allowing Lilo and Jumba to ambush him and temporarily incapacitate his weapons with water. Defenseless, Splodyhead attempted to escape back to the nest, but was stopped when Stitch tackled him, enabling Gantu to capture Splodyhead in a makeshift net and put him into a containment orb.\n\nRealizing they had worked together, Stitch attempted to make amends with Gantu by shaking hands with the latter, but Gantu ungratefully pushed the former aside. The two factions and Splodyhead were soon rescued from the island by [[Nani Pelekai|Nani]] and [[David Kawena|David]] driving motorboats, but not before Lilo briefly lectured Gantu's brash nature.\n\nSplodyhead was shortly after taken back to Kauai, where Lilo and Stitch found him a one true place lighting tiki torches at the luau. He also charred a piece of cake with his fiery plasma before devouring it.\n\nIn \"[[Houdini (episode)|Houdini]]\", Splodyhead was one of the audience members for Stitch's bungled magic act.\n\nIn \"[[Slushy (episode)|Slushy]]\", Jumba adjusted Splodyhead's thermostat so he wouldn't overheat in hot temperatures, to which he politely thanked Jumba in return. Splodyhead was later sent to [[Slushy]]'s ice palace to defeat the latter. After a long-drawn-out battle between the two experiments, Splodyhead was defeated when Slushy froze him into a block of ice. He was later freed and blasted a fireball into the sky at the top of Waialeale Peak to clear Slushy's snowstorms.\n\nSplodyhead reappeared in \"[[Slugger (episode)|Slugger]]\" as part of Lilo's softball team.\n\nIn \"[[Spike (episode)|Spike]]\", Splodyhead was one of the experiments in Pleakley's E.A.R.W.A.X. group. When a stray snowball from Slushy accidentally hit Splodyhead (who had suffered from boredom), a battle ensued between the two experiments, which ended when Pleakley convinced Slushy and Splodyhead to attempt hugging therapy on each other.\n\nSlushy and Splodyhead were seen on a computer screen in \"[[Ace (episode)|Ace]]\", posing as evil creations of Jumba's as part of a hoax to fool [[Mortlegax]], the head of E.G.O. industries.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nSplodyhead was seen early in the movie lighting an overhead tiki torch as [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] was making her rounds with [[Scrump]] to make sure all the experiments were happy in the one true place they belonged.\n\nLater, the first 624 experiments, including Splodyhead, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, Lilo, [[Stitch]], Jumba, [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]] and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nSplodyhead participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]] by blasting Leroys away with plasma attacks.\n\nHowever, the Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.\n\n===''[[Stitch!]]''===\nSplodyhead made a cameo appearance in the ''Stitch!'' anime as one of the experiments in [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s [[Prison Asteroid K-37|prison cell]]. He has also made a number of other appearances, twice with [[Plasmoid]]. In the first appearance, Splodyhead and Plasmoid combated [[Stitch]] when he was hypnotized by [[Swirly]] into fighting for H\u00e4msterviel. In the second appearance, Splodyhead and Plasmoid were modified by H\u00e4msterviel to attack Stitch. Splodyhead was given a new ability to fire purple balls of a repulsive odor. Also, after the effects were reversed, Splodyhead could expel pink gas of an aromatic smell, the opposite of his modified ability. In \"Shogun\", it is shown that Splodyhead was dehydrated back into an experiment pod and locked in [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]]'s vault. He made a final appearance in aiding Stitch in battle against [[Dark End]].\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*In [[Splodyhead (episode)|his debut]], Splodyhead's number was pronounced as \"six-nineteen\" by Jumba, rather than the typical by-digit pronunciation of most other experiments (which would be \"six-one-nine\" in Splodyhead's case).\n*Splodyhead is one of the rare experiments to not have black eyes like most experiments, having dark blue eyes instead.\n*Splodyhead, along with [[Nosox]], [[Richter]], Butter, [[Tank (Lilo & Stitch)|Tank]], [[Gigi]], [[Shortstuff]], [[Yang]], [[Spike (Lilo & Stitch)|Spike]], [[Phoon]], and one unconfirmed experiment, are the only known experiments that are primarily quadrupeds.\n*Splodyhead's [[Experiment Pods|pod]] color is blue in [[Lilo & Stitch: The Series|the original series]]. In the ''[[Stitch!]]'' anime, it is red.\n*In \"[[Slushy (episode)|Slushy]]\", Jumba somehow erroneously referred to Splodyhead as 515, a number taken by [[Deforestator]].\n*Splodyhead appears to share a grudge with [[Slushy]], but they resolved it in \"[[Spike (episode)|Spike]]\".\n*Splodyhead's head appears in the online game ''[[Jumba's Lab (Game)|Jumba's Lab]]''.\n*Splodyhead made a cameo in ''[[Big Hero 6]]'' as one of the pillows on [[Fred (Big Hero 6)|Fred]]'s bed. This makes him the only experiment other than Stitch to appear in a [[Disney Animated Canon]] film.\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Video game bosses]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]"
