They have duck-billed beak-like mouths with a bird-like head and a long neck. They also have small clawed front hands, long hind legs, and a long tail.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Fantasia]]''===\nA few Ornithomimus appears briefly in ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' segment of ''[[Fantasia]]''. They are first seen marching through a marsh and stopping for a drink of water. Some of them noticed the arrival of the [[Tyrannosaurus Rex]], and others, including a mother and her babies, are shown running out of the way of the T. rex before it fought the [[Stegosaurus]].\n\n===''[[The Legend of Tarzan]]''===\nOrnithomimus were among the dinosaurs dwelling in [[Pellucidar]]. A flock of them were seen running along as a flock of [[Pteranodon]] swooped overhead.  [[Samuel T. Philander]] later took pictures of the flock before the arrival of a [[Female Tyrannosaurus|mother]] [[Tyrannosaurus rex]]. \n\n==Disney Parks==\nAnimatronics of Ornithomimus were featured in the [[Ford Magic Skyway]] at the 1964 New York World's Fair. When the Fair ended, they were incorporated into the [[Primeval World]] diorama and placed in a vignette where they drank from a shrinking watering hole in a desert, much like the ending of the ''Fantasia'' sequence.\n\nThese figures were replicated for the [[Universe of Energy]] attraction and placed in a scene where one had fallen into a bubbling mudpit while the other two looked on. When the attraction became Ellen's Energy Adventure, the mudpit effects were removed and the trapped dinosaur was recast as a creature playfully spitting water at guests from a marsh.\n\nA bronze statue of an Ornithomimus is displayed in the [[Cretaceous Trail]] in [[DinoLand U.S.A.]].\n\n==Trivia==\n*Ornithomimus was found to be feathered like ostriches. Large feathers much like those on an ostrich have been found on the arms and body. The legs were covered in bare skin from mid-thigh down to the feet.\n*Ornithomimus is thought to have been an herbivore based on gastroliths (stomach stones) found within and alongside skeletons.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nNF-112P Jungle Life at Beginning of Time Ford Magic Ride.jpg|In [[Ford Magic Skyway]]\nBon123234LARGE.jpg|Ornithomimus at [[Primeval World]]\nTumblr_niagoyJOkO1rqqcizo1_1280.jpg|Ornithomimus from the Universe of Energy being built\nOrnithomimus running.jpg.png\nOrnithomimus concept art.jpg.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Fantasia}}\n[[Category:Dinosaurs]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric animals]]\n[[Category:Fantasia characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Tarzan characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:African characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric characters]]"
