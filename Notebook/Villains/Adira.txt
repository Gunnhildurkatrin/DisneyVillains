A fierce, yet mysterious warrior, she serves as [[Rapunzel]]'s guide to the source of the ominous [[Black Rocks|black rocks]] that have plagued parts of the world.\n==Background==\nTwenty-five years before the start of the series, Adira was a servant of [[King Edmund]] and resided in [[the Dark Kingdom]] corrupted by a powerful opal. When the stone's power made their home too unbearable for life, Adira and her associates [[Quirin]] and [[Hector (Tangled)|Hector]] were ordered to leave the kingdom and stop anyone from finding the stone's location.\n\nIn the following years, Adira dedicated her life to studying the mysterious black rocks connected to the opal that destroyed her kingdom. She believed that a source of light existed that will counter the darkness of the Moonstone. Her travels would lead her to [[Corona]], where she discovered that the rocks had been searching for [[Rapunzel|Princess Rapunzel]]\u2014the sun-drop. Having learned the same, Rapunzel left her kingdom to uncover the truth behind the rocks, prompting Adira to reveal herself so to steer the princess on the right path, to the Dark Kingdom.\n\n===Abilities===\nAdira a master of the Martial arts, swordplay, and marksmanship, able to easily dodge Rapunzel and Cassandra combined with both hands behind her back. She is fast with her agility.\n\n==Role in the [[Tangled|series]]==\n===Season One===\nAdira makes her first appearance in a brief scene at the end of \"[[Secret of the Sun Drop]]\". After the fall of [[Varian]] through the power of the blacks rocks\u2014activated by Rapunzel\u2014Adira looks over the damage of [[Old Corona]] before using her blade to slice through one of the rocks.\n\n===Season Two===\nAs seen in \"[[Beyond the Corona Walls]]\", Adira had followed Rapunzel and her allies while lurking in the shadows. She does not reveal herself until a few days into their journey, meeting the princess and her bodyguard, [[Cassandra (Tangled)|Cassandra]], when she does. Adira asks for a moment to speak with Rapunzel, alone, but Cassandra is less welcoming to the idea. Though she has no intentions of fighting, Adira fiercely throws Cassandra off her feet after being touched by the latter. Furious, both Cassandra and Rapunzel attempt to strike Adira down, but the latter dodges each of their attacks with ease. Eventually, Rapunzel grabs hold of Adira's wrist with her hair, prompting an infuriated Adira to try to cut it with her blade. As Rapunzel's hair is impenetrable, however, nothing happens\u2014shocking Adira. Before things can continue, [[Hook Foot]] appears with urgent news for Rapunzel, so Adira takes her leave.\n\nThough not onscreen, Adira continues to watch over Rapunzel. When the princess finds herself in battle with a notorious [[The Baron|kingpin]] and his thugs over her boyfriend, [[Flynn Rider|Eugene]], she tries to unleash the rocks' power by touching it, though nothing occurs when she does. Adira explains that the rocks no longer react because they have already found what they were looking for. This forces Rapunzel and her friends to battle the Baron, themselves. Adira jumps into the fight, as well, but silently leaves the moment it is over.\n\nThe next day, she approaches alone with Rapunzel and explains her mission and gives her the second piece of the scroll. After informing the princess that the rocks are leading to the Dark Kingdom, Eugene assures that they will make it. Satisfied, Adira takes her leave but continues to watch on from a distance.\n\nShe returns in \"[[Forest of No Return]]\", where she serves as a guide to Rapunzel's gang through a dangerous forest she dubbed as \"the deadly forest of no return\". According to her, only a few had gotten out of the forest alive and she's one of them. She also revealed to have bronchitis. Her excellent survival skills, however, made Eugene jealous and causes him to attempt to compete with her until the two talked it out when they got separated from the others. When everyone finally got out of the forest, Adira makes her leave again but apparently still watches them from a distance.\n\nIn \"[[Keeper of the Spire]]\", she told Rapunzel to find the third piece of the scroll in the spire when the princess asked how she's supposed to find her destiny. She did not go with them but presumably watches Rapunzel and her friends as they follow Calliope, the Keeper's apprentice, to the spire. Her next onscreen appearance shows her listening in on Rapunzel and her friends' conversation about the third scroll piece and smiles suspiciously.\n\nIn \"[[Rapunzel and the Great Tree]]\", she arrives in time to help Rapunzel and her friends escape Hector, whom she had known 25 years ago. She explained that she, Hector, and Quirin are members of the Brotherhood, a group of people dedicated to keeping anyone from reaching the Dark Kingdom. She leads the team through the Great Tree, despite Cassandra's distrust in her and the fact that it was once a home of Zhan Tiri. Along the way, they learned about the Moonstone's incantation and its effect on Rapunzel. Later, they ran into Hector again and fought him, even when he became possessed by the spirit of the Great Tree. As the tree crumbled by Rapunzel's use of the Moon Stone incantation, Hector told them that Adira's lying to them and if they go to the Dark Kingdom, they're doomed. Adira saved Hector from his fall and went with him as Rapunzel and the team continued their journey.\n\nAdira returned in \"[[Destinies Collide]]\", in time to help the group fight against a disguised King Edmund, but was thrown off the gondola down into the deep trench. Fortunately, she survived the fall but lost her sword in the process. She climbed back up to lead Rapunzel and the others inside the castle and along the way, told them the whole story about the origins of the Moonstone and her true intentions. When Edmund and Eugene, who was discovered to be his long-lost son, blocked them from entering, Adira realized Edmund's plan to destroy the Moonstone using her sword and found another way inside the castle through the underground sewers. When they entered the throne room, Adira, Lance, and Cassandra tried to take down the king but were easily overpowered by him. When the ghosts of the past Dark Kings rose to stop them, they managed to defeat them by destroying their statues. In the aftermath, Adira helped lift a wreckage of one of the destroyed statues blocking the entrance to the Moonstone chamber, allowing Rapunzel, Eugene and Cassandra to enter.\n\n===Season Three===\nIn \"[[Rapunzel's Return]]\", Adira, Lance and Maximus enter the Moonstone chambers and discover Cassandra's betrayal. When Cassandra attacks Rapunzel, Adira goes to strike and urges Cassandra to release the Moonstone, but is met with refusal and is flung back against the room and loses her sword in the process. Lance goes to Adira's aid while Cassandra gains possession of Adira's Shadowblade and escapes. Adira remains behind in the Dark Kingdom, informing Lance a new path has been made for her and watches as Rapunzel and her friends depart.\n\nIn \"[[Race to the Spire]]\", Adira is briefly seen back in the Forest of No Return, when she, Hector, and Quirin fall under the control of the Mind Trap that Cassandra and Zhan Tiri stole from [[the Spire]].\n\nAdira, along with Hector, returns in \"[[Once a Handmaiden...]]\", still under the control of the Mind Trap and helping Cassandra take over Corona against her will. In the process, she duels against a reluctant Lance, who cannot bring himself to harm her and ultimately evacuates the kingdom with its citizens.\n\nIn \"[[Plus Est En Vous]]\", she and Hector are seen in [[Cassandra's Stronghold]]. Edmund soon destroys the Mind Trap (thanks to Eugene's words of forgiveness), freeing himself, Adira and Hector from its effects. Adira accompanies Edmund, Eugene, and Hector back to Corona, where they join the kingdom's citizens in their battle against [[Zhan Tiri]], who has transformed into a giant demon after gaining possession of both the Sundrop and the Moonstone and chants the Decay Incantation to weaken Adira and everyone else. Following Zhan Tiri's defeat at the hands of Rapunzel and a redeemed Cassandra, Adira and the others are revived by Rapunzel's Healing Incantation and proudly watch Eugene, Rapunzel, and Cassandra sharing a group hug as peace is restored to Corona.\n\nAt the end of the series, Adira returns to the Dark Kingdom with Edmund and Hector.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The comet shaped mark on Adira's hand is the emblem of the Dark Kingdom.\n*She used to be a warrior to the dark kingdom, but left due to the destructive powers of the moonstone. As seen in the series, she is now resting in the forest and helps Rapunzel and her team in challenges.\n*She has bronchitis.<ref>\"[[Forest of No Return]]\"</ref>\n*Adira's face paint is made to hint that sometimes there are two sides to a character, and that they may or may not be trustworthy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tangledbea.tumblr.com/post/175986951229/benbalistreri-replied-to-your-post-what-do-we|title=tangledbea post |website=Tumblr|accessdate=July 17, 2018}}</ref>\n*Adira's costume design is inspired by Korean culture.\n*\"Adira\" is a Hebrew name that means \"strong,\" \"powerful,\" or \"noble.\"\n\n==Gallery==\n===Concept Art===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nAdira concept 1.jpg\nAdira concept 2.jpg\nAdira concept 3.jpg\nAdira concept 4.jpg\nAdira concept 5.jpg\nAdira concept 6.jpg\nAdira concept 7.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nBlack Rocks Cut.jpg|Adira slicing the black rocks with her sword.\nBeyond the Corona Walls 32.jpg|25 years ago\nBeyond the Corona Walls 55.jpeg\nBeyond the Corona Walls 56.jpeg\nBeyond the Corona Walls 57.jpeg\nBeyond the Corona Walls 35.png\nBlack Rock Sword.jpg|Failed to cut [[Rapunzel's Magic Hair|Rapunzel's hair]]\nBeyond the Corona Walls 63.jpeg\nBeyond the Corona Walls 34.png\nBeyond the Corona Walls 68.jpeg\nBeyond the Corona Walls 51.jpeg\nBeyond the Corona Walls 36.png\nForest of No Return 11.jpg\nForest of No Return 12.jpg\nForest of No Return 14.jpg\nForest of No Return 21.jpg\nForest of No Return 22.jpg\nForest of No Return 24.jpg\nKeeper of the Spire 14.jpg\nQuirin and Adira.png\nRatGT Adira to the rescue.jpg\nRapunzel and the Great Tree (4).jpg\nCassandra suspicious of Adira.jpg|Cassandra confronts Adira on her suspicions of her.\nRapunzel and the Great Tree (19).jpg\nRapunzel and the Great Tree.jpg\nDestinies Collide (66).jpg\nRapunzel's Return (7).jpg\nRapunzel's Return (8).jpg\nRapunzel's Return (9).jpg\nRace to the Spire (15).jpg|Under Cassandra's control.\nOnce a Handmaiden...
