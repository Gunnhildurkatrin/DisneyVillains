He also has a long jaw, with a big black nose and two protruding fangs.\n\n==History==\nWhenever he sees food, he's all over it, and would do anything to get it. But he and his son [[Bent-Tail Junior]] always have to get by Pluto in order to do so, and they fail every time but they try not to give up.\n\nAfter appearing in four theatrical shorts, Bent-Tail and his son weren't seen anymore in cinema. However, the two were revived in the TV movie [[The Coyote's Lament]] from [[Walt Disney anthology series|Walt Disney Presents]]. Here, Bent-Tail is an elderly coyote, while Junior is an adult and has a son of his own. The film also introduced the signature \"Yip Yip Yip Yowl\" song that would be the coyotes' theme song. Pluto appears in the film as their foil once again in the cutscenes. However, Pluto was not aged as an elderly mutt, although in the classic shorts Bent-Tail and Pluto are adults of the same age.\n\nAfter [[Walt Disney]]'s death in [[1966]], the coyotes were never seen again, until [[1991]], through the TV movie ''Disney's Coyote Tales''. The film centers Bent-Tail Junior's son learning through past experiences (made up of classic cartoons). This film is essentially a remake of the [[1961]] TV film, except that it also featured additional cartoons that did not star Bent-Tail, which were essentially a mixture of [[Donald Duck]], [[Mickey Mouse]], and Pluto shorts, as well as some one-shots. Added cartoons in the 1991 film include ''[[The Whalers]]'' ([[1938]]), ''[[Beezy Bear]]'' ([[1955]]), ''[[Good Scouts]]'' (1938), ''[[Lambert the Sheepish Lion]]'' ([[1952]]), ''[[Goliath II]]'' ([[1960]]), ''[[The Ugly Duckling (1939)|The Ugly Duckling ]]''([[1939]]), etc. Also, all the cutscenes from this film were re-used from the 1961 film original, but with re-dubbed dialogue supplied by [[Jim Cummings]] as the voices of an elderly Bent-Tail and an adult Bent-Tail Junior. In addition, the Walt Disney host sequences were omitted (this is typical for many post-Walt episodes of [[Walt Disney anthology series|the anthology series]]).\n\n==Classic cartoon appearances==\n*''[[The Legend of Coyote Rock]]''\n*''[[Sheep Dog]]''\n*''[[Pests of the West]]''\n*''[[Camp Dog]]''\n\n==TV movies==\n*''[[The Coyote's Lament]]'' ([[1961]])\n*''Disney's Coyote Tales'' ([[1991]])\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nBent-Tail.jpg|Bent-Tail in the comics\nLegend of Coyote Rock 5.jpg\nLegend of Coyote Rock 4.jpg\nLegend of Coyote Rock 3.jpg\nLegend of Coyote Rock 2.jpg\nLegend of Coyote Rock 1.jpg\nBent-Tail Coyote.jpg\nBent Cola.jpg\nCoyotesLament2.png|An older Bent-Tail from ''[[The Coyote's Lament]]''.\n1949-berger-3.jpg\n1945-coyote-2.jpg\n1945-coyote-5.jpg\n1945-coyote-4.jpg\n1950-coyotes-2.jpg\n1950-coyotes-4.jpg\n1950-chiendegarde-2.jpg|Bent-Tail howling at the moon with his son\n1950-chiendegarde-3.jpg\n1950-chiendegarde-5.jpg\nTumblr n4s0v4apQV1r3jmn6o3 1280.png\nTumblr n4s0v4apQV1r3jmn6o1 500.png\nVacation Parade 1 p098.jpg\nVacation Parade 1 p095.jpg\nVacation Parade 1 p094.jpg\nVacation Parade 1 p093.jpg\nLEGEND_OF_COYOTE_ROCK.png|Bent-Tail hiding himself\nTumblr na7jaccuBM1r3jmn6o2 500.png\nTumblr na7jaccuBM1r3jmn6o1 1280.png\nTumblr nkkbrrzjyD1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\nBent-Tail Coyote howling.jpg|Bent-Tail howling\nTumblr_nqd87xoutU1r3jmn6o1_1280.png\nTumblr_nqd8c7su6w1r3jmn6o1_1280.png\nTumblr_nqsanfIPhV1qhcrb0o1_1280.jpg\nTumblr_ns2munKFQa1qhcrb0o1_1280.jpg|Pluto howls with the coyotes\nBent-Tail Coyote Crying.jpeg|Bent-Tail crying\nBent tail coyote picture.jpeg\nBent-Tail Coyote getting ready to howl.jpeg\n49605.jpg\nCamp Dog Coyotes.jpeg\nPluto scares Bent-Tail Coyote.jpeg\n49907.jpg\nBenttail.jpg\nPluto gun and trap threaten bent-tail.jpg\n</gallery>\n{{Mickey Mouse & Friends}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Coyotes]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
