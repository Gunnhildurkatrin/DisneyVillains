She is voiced by [[Lauren Tom]].\n==History==\n\n[[File:Susan_Long1.jpg|thumb|Susan Long in Season One]][[File:252555.jpg|thumb|Susan Long in Season Two]]She is a [[dragon]] who appears as a Chinese woman. She is [[Jake Long|Jake]] and [[Haley Long|Haley]]'s mother, as well as the daughter of the previous Chinese Dragon [[Luong Lao Shi|Lao Shi]], and [[Jonathan Long|Jonathan]]'s wife.\n\nAlthough descended from a supposedly pure bloodline of Chinese dragons, she herself does not possess any dragon powers because it skipped her generation as it sometimes does; and thus is locked in human form. She owns her own catering service which has been known to service premiere events such as the televised wedding of famous soap opera stars Thad Rochefort-Chaise and Jasma Sancere<ref>[[Jake Takes the Cake]]</ref>.\n\nEver since twelfth-grade in high school, Susan kept secret from [[Jonathan Long|Jonathan]] the truth about her family of \"magical reptiles\", having been reluctant to reveal it to him while trying to work up the courage to tell him that magical creatures are real out of fear of how he would react \u2013 that he would freak out and possibly leave her, which he nearly did<ref>[[Hero of the Hourglass]]</ref>. Jake learned that she had written a letter while they were dating, explaining her family's dragon heritage, but had never given it to him. Using time travel, Jake took the note and put it in his father's locker, causing him to actually leave her until Jake could straighten everything up. She's been trying to work her way to tell him that magical creatures are real.\n\nShe was finally forced to reveal everything to Jonathan after he accidentally walked in on Haley in dragon form<ref>[[The Hong Kong Longs]]</ref>. Not only did he take it well, much to Susan's relief, but he immediately proceeded to help Jake after discovering the trouble they were in. Susan took part in the final battle with the Dark Dragon, the first and only time in the series she participated in a battle, destroying some of the Shade Demons with a camera flash.\n\n==Episode Appearances==\n===Season One===\n*''[[Old School Training]]'' (first appearances)\n*''[[Dragon Breath]]''\n*''[[The Legend of Dragon Tooth]]''\n*''[[Act 4, Scene 15]]''\n*''[[Adventures in Troll Sitting]]''\n*''[[Shapeshifter]]''\n*''[[The Long Weekend]]''\n*''[[Jake Take the Cake]]''\n*''[[Hong Kong Nights]]''\n*''[[Ring Around the Dragon]]''\n\n===Season Two===\n*''[[Half Baked]]''\n*''[[The Doppelganger Gang]]''\n*''[[Something Fishy This Way Comes]]'' (mentioned)\n*''[[Family Business (American Dragon: Jake Long)|Family Business]]''\n*''[[Hero of the Hourglass]]''\n*''[[Dreamscape]]''\n*''[[Feeding Frenzy]]''\n*''[[Haley Gone Wild]]''\n*''[[The Rotwood Files]]''\n*''[[Hairy Christmas]]''\n*''[[Year of the Jake]]''\n*''[[Young at Heart]]''\n*''[[Being Human]]''\n*''[[The Hong Kong Longs]]'' (Final appearance)\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*In Season 2, Susan's nail polish kept appearing and disappearing whenever her hands were seen.\n*Susan is shown to hate [[Hans Rotwood|Mr. Rotwood]] because of two episodes.\n**Jake used his shapeshifting powers to turn into Rotwood and made it look like he was a nut<ref>[[Shapeshifter]]</ref>.\n**Susan attacked Rotwood, believing him to be insane<ref>[[The Rotwood Files]]</ref>.\n*She along with all the characters from season 1, was given a makeover in season 2 which is more sterner than her first season debut.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{American Dragon: Jake Long}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Long, Susan}}\n[[Category:American Dragon: Jake Long characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Chinese characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Aunts]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Dragons]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Humans raised by animals]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
