The sound leads them to a [[The Ugly Duckling (character)|lone little cygnet]] who mistakenly believed himself to be a duckling due to being hatched in a duck's nest.\n\nBecause he was so different from their other ducklings, the ducks had cast him out of their family and his failure to find acceptance anywhere else because of his \"ugliness\" had crushed his hope of ever being loved. After the mother swan's cygnets introduce themselves and convince him to come and play, she calls out to them, but the Ugly Duckling's fear of further rejection made him hesitant to even approach her.\n\nHowever, the mother swan pulls him close (despite his initial resistance) and lovingly embraces him to\u00a0prove that she doesn't consider him ugly at all and that she's willing to take him in due to his plight. Realizing this, he happily embraces her back, accepting her and her cygnets as his family.\n\nAt the short's end, the mother swan is last seen leading of her cygnets home (including the Ugly Duckling). It was never specified in the short if she was his real mother who somehow lost his egg or an adoptive mother, but either way, she gave him what he needed the most: a loving family.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nThe Ugly Duckling swan model.jpg\nUD12large.jpg\nMothersembrace.png\nMother Swan 1.png\nMother Swan 2.png\nMother Swan.png\nlilo-stitch-disneyscreencaps_com-6584.jpg|thumb|250px|The mother swan in ''[[Lilo & Stitch]]''\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*The mother swan makes a cameo in ''[[Lilo & Stitch]]'', where she is seen in a book.\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Silly Symphonies characters]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Swans]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]"
