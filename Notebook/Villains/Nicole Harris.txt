She used to live in a small apartment opposite of [[Mrs. Steinmetz]]'s [[The Firehouse (The Love Bug)|firehouse]] until [[Alonzo Hawk]] came to tear it down. When she found out his plan, she decided to move in and protect her.\n\nNicole is known by Mrs. Steinmetz to be a brave young lady who once knocked out a hijacker with a bottle of [[California]] wine. She also knows how to throw a punch when she first meets Willoughby. This is mainly because he knows Willoughby is from the Hawk Corporation and is just trying to protect Mrs. Steinmetz from being harassed by any more of his goons. \n\nAt first, Nicole does not like Willoughby because he not only works for Alonzo, but is also his nephew. On their first meeting, she hits him twice in the face with her fist and with a boiled lobster during their first lunch together. As the film goes on, she grows to like him when he volunteers to help fight against Alonzo. Soon, she develops a romantic relationship with Willoughby, and after Alonzo is arrested, they get married.\n\nNicole is last seen with Willoughby driving away in [[Herbie]] like [[Jim Douglas|Jim]] and [[Carole Bennet|Carole]] in the first film.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nHerbie Rides Again 5.jpg\nHerbie Rides Again 6.jpg|Nicole about to punch Willoughby\nHerbie Rides Again 7.jpg\nHerbie-Rides-Again-2.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Love Bug}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Harris, Nicole}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:The Love Bug characters]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]"
