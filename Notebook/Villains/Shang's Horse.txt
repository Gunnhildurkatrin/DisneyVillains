He appears in the parade in the first movie, and is seen in the second film saving his rider's life.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nHe is a very loyal and faithful horse that tends to get frightened rather easily. In the first movie, he becomes afraid of a loud sound\u00a0from the burning village and gets startled when a burnt staircase collapses, then disappears during the avalanche. In the sequel, he gets scared\u00a0of being grabbed unexpectedly and becomes disgusted after [[Yao, Ling, and Chien Po|Yao]] kisses him,\u00a0then disappears once again for some time. Besides that, he is usually a calm, quiet horse and is very well-tamed.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nHe is based on the traditional [[China|Chinese]] horse models. He is white with gray dapples, a short black\u00a0mane, and\u00a0a docked tail. He is always seen with a saddle and bridle.\n\n==Trivia==\n*He doesn't have a given name in the movie.\n*His dapples form a [[Hidden Mickey]].\n*He has white hair, which represents the traditionally \"masculine\" [[Wikipedia:Yin and yang|yang]]; whereas\u00a0[[Khan|Mulan's horse]] has black hair, which represents the traditionally \"feminine\" [[Wikipedia:Yin and yang|yin]].\n*His tail is styled like Shang's topknot.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nShang 51.PNG\nmulan-disneyscreencaps.com-5959.jpg\nShang 52.PNG\nShang 58.PNG\nShang 82.PNG\n23452p.jpg\nMulan2-disneyscreencaps.com-1527.jpg\nMulan2-disneyscreencaps.com-1582.jpg\nMulan2-disneyscreencaps.com-2662.jpg\nMulan2-disneyscreencaps.com-2733.jpg\nMulan2-disneyscreencaps.com-3718.jpg\nImagesCA3QJHQI.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Mulan}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Mulan characters]]\n[[Category:Horses]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Military characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]"
