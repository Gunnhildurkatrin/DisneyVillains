She led the conspiracy involving predators mysteriously disappearing, as she harbored a secret hatred towards that portion of Zootopia's population. She was portrayed as a calculated and highly intelligent leader, while animatics also imply her to be fairly vain.\n\nHaving a pig serve as the film's villain was partially inspired by the filmmakers' research; they discovered that pigs are amongst the most intelligent animals, which would make sense for a character leading a villainous operation while simultaneously fooling their people. The mayor was initially conceived as a pig not just to fit her intelligence, but also so that her appearance (a pink and soft animal) could be easily juxtaposed with her murderous, cold-blooded nature.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/06/05/zootopia-mayor-originally-female-pig/85243742/|title='Zootopia' mayor was originally a woman \u2014 and a pig\n|website=USA Today|last=Alexander|first=Byran|year=2016|month=June 5|format=Article|accessyear=2016|accessdate=June 5}}</ref>\n\nEventually, Swinton's role as Zootopia's mayor was scrapped in favor of the generally well-intentioned [[Mayor Lionheart]]. The switch from Swinton to Lionheart was based on the common conception that lions are \"king of the jungle\", making it seem logical to cast a lion as the leader of an all-animal city. Bellwether, meanwhile, was given Swinton's role as the main antagonist whose plans stemmed from a hatred of carnivores. Lionheart also became Bellwether's primary target.\n\n==Role in the [[Zootopia|film]]==\nAccording to directors [[Byron Howard]] and [[Rich Moore]], Swinton remained in the final version of the movie, but was reworked to appear in a cameo role as a police warden watching over the arrested Bellwether during the [[Gazelle]] concert end credits.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"160\">\nSwinton concept art .jpg\nSwinton Animatic .jpg\nSwinton animatic(2).jpg\nZootopia character model line-up.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Zootopia}}\n[[ar:\u0633\u0648\u064a\u0646\u062a\u0648\u0646]]\n[[de:Swinton]]\n[[Category:Pigs]]\n[[Category:Zootopia characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Police officers]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]"
