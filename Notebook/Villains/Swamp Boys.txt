When America Sings closed in 1988, their animatronics were moved to the new attraction [[Splash Mountain]]. They appear in the finale scene in all 3 versions of the ride.  Following Splash Mountain's announced closure due to the ride's [[Song of the South|history of racism]], it is unknown what the fate of the Swamp Boys will be.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n=== America Sings ===\nThey first appeared in the Going South sequence of Disneyland's America Sings attraction, where they performed \"Polly Wolly Doodle\".\n\n=== Splash Mountain ===\nThe Swamp Boys appeared in the grand finale of Splash Mountain off to the side, playing their instruments and singing ''[[Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah]]''.  In [[Walt Disney World]], a poster in the queue of the attraction advertised the Swamp Boys as a band with the tag-line of, \"If you're lookin' for music that won't bog you down\".\n\n=== Parades ===\nTwo of the Swamp Boys are said to be featured in Tokyo Disneyland's Dreams on Parade: Moving On as walk around characters.\n\n== Other Appearances ==\n\n=== [[Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two]] ===\nThe alligators also appear in ''Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two'' as an animatronic jugband in [[Bog Easy]]. The alligators appear in the Zip-a-dee-do-dah day mini-game set on the Play Disney Parks app.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In America Sings, the Swamp Boys appeared alongside a racoon which was moved to the ''[[How Do You Do?|How Do You Do]]'' scenes for the [[Walt Disney World]] and [[Tokyo Disneyland]] versions, but appears in the finale of the [[Disneyland]] version.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\n3109814588 907c3e40aa.jpg|The Swamp Boys in Disneyland's Splash Mountain\nAmersings splash2.jpg|The raccoon in Disneyland's Splash Mountain\nSwamp Boys.jpg|A poster promoting the Swamp Boys from the queue area of Walt Disney World's Splash Mountain\nDgsm2.jpg\nSwamp Boys- Epic Mickey2.jpg|The Swamp Boys in ''Epic Mickey 2''\n1C0AB3A5-83AF-42B3-9FB4-8E873B752E33.jpeg|The Swamp Boys in the ''Play Disney Parks'' app\nDreams on Parade.jpg|Dreams on Parade\n</gallery>\n\n{{Epic Mickey}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Raccoons]]\n[[Category:Splash Mountain characters]]\n[[Category:Bands]]\n[[Category:Epic Mickey characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:America Sings]]\n[[Category:Alligators]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]"
