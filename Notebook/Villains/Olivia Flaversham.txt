She is the daughter of [[Mr. Flaversham]].\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nOlivia is generally an innocent, sweet, rambunctious, very brave little girl. She adores everyone, especially [[Mr. Flaversham|her father]] (who is her only living relative, due to her mother's death). Olivia is fond of fuzzy animals, particularly [[Toby (The Great Mouse Detective)|Toby]]. She becomes irritated when people tell her last name wrong (as is evident when [[Basil of Baker Street|Basil]] gets it wrong on a multitude of occasions), so she typically corrects them (on one occasion, with the help of [[Dr. David Q. Dawson|Dr. Dawson]]), although by the end of the movie, it is shown to be an inside joke among them.\n\n==Role in the film==\n[[File:Mousedetective017.jpg|thumb|left|250px]]\nWhile celebrating her birthday, during which she received a [[Mouse Ballerina|dancing mouse doll]], Olivia's [[Mr. Flaversham|father]] was kidnapped by a peg-leg bat named [[Fidget]]. She went to look for [[Basil of Baker Street|Basil]] but did not know where Baker Street was and got lost on the way.\n\nShe soon met a kind mouse named [[David Q. Dawson|Dr. David Q. Dawson]], who had just returned home after recent military service in Afghanistan when he stumbled upon Olivia. Feeling sorry for the girl, Dawson took her to the home of [[Basil of Baker Street]], where Olivia soon met the housekeeper, [[Mrs. Judson]], who welcomed her in and treated her with great love and care, acting as somewhat of a mother towards her (which was, no doubt, a new experience for Olivia, since she doesn't have a mother).\n\n[[File:Olivia156.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Olivia talks to Basil about the bat, who kidnapped her father.]]\nSoon enough, Basil came back to his home, where he was, at first, uninterested in Olivia's case. However, upon her mentioning of her father having been taken by a bat, Basil saw the case as a chance to finally catch his arch-nemesis, [[Ratigan|Professor Ratigan]]. After telling Basil the story of the kidnapping in exact detail, it was obvious to Basil that Ratigan had something big planned. As Basil began to ponder what Ratigan would need a toymaker for, Fidget appeared outside Basil's window, a sight that made Olivia scream in terror. As Basil and Dr. Dawson rushed outside to investigate, Mrs. Judson comforted the frightened Olivia.\n\n[[File:The-Great-Mouse-Detective-classic-disney-19894398-1280-720.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Olivia meets Toby.]]\nThe duo soon returned with plans to hunt down the kidnapper with help from Basil's friend, [[Toby]]. Olivia wanted to come with Basil and Dr. Dawson, but Basil wouldn't allow it, saying \"this is certainly no place for children.\" Olivia, however, was allowed to come along (for reasons unknown). When Olivia found out that Toby was a dog, she was, at first, scared, but quickly became friends with the pooch after giving him one of Mrs. Judson's cheese crumpets.\n\n[[File:Basil & Olivia (7).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Olivia and Basil looking at Fidget's footprints.]]\nThe group soon journeyed to a local toy store, where Fidget (who had left his hat when he fled from Basil's home) was collecting toy soldier uniforms for Ratigan's sinister plot. During the trip through the toy store, Olivia was ambushed by Fidget, who quickly spirited her away to [[Ratigan's lair]]. She then reunites with her father until Ratigan pulls Olivia hand and then fidgets takes her away. Fidget drags Olivia to a bottle and tosses her into the bottle. Olivia remains captured in a bottle for a decent portion of the movie up to the point when Basil and Dr. Dawson come to free her. They succeed in doing so after they escape Ratigan's death machine.\n\nOlivia, Basil and Dr. Dawson (after leaving a picture for Ratigan to remember them by) then rushed on to Buckingham Palace, where they saved the [[Queen Mousetoria|Queen]] from being eaten by Ratigan's pet cat [[Felicia]], and then [[Mr. Flaversham]] from Ratigan's goons. Unfortunately, Fidget broke free of his bonds and Olivia soon found herself kidnapped again, with Ratigan holding her by her collar over a banister showing Basil, Dawson, and her father. She was thrown into Ratigan's blimp, which was soon pursued by a makeshift balloon that Basil, Dr. Dawson, and Mr. Flaversham made out of some balloons and the Union Jack.\n\n[[File:Great-mouse-detective-disneyscreencaps.com-8259.jpg||thumb|left|250px|Olivia says goodbye to Basil and Dr. Dawson.]]\nThe chase ended when Ratigan's blimp crashed into the [[Big Ben]] clock tower, where Ratigan gagged Olivia she bit Ratigan and basil got his cape and put it in the gears Ratigan was choking he dropped Olivia and kicked Olivia into the gears of Big Ben, hoping to rid of her. Basil hurriedly returned Olivia to her father, but Basil wouldn't escape so quickly. A battle waged on the hands of Big Ben sent Ratigan plummeting to his doom. Olivia believed that Basil, too, had perished (Ratigan having tried to drop Basil several stories to his doom) until he was revealed to have survived by using a piece of the destroyed dirigible. Olivia, having been reunited with her father, left after saying her goodbyes to Basil and Dr. Dawson.\n\n==Printed media==\n===Comics===\nDuring a ''[[Disney Adventures]]'' comic that was set in the same year of 1897, but somewhat after the movie, she does mysteries, too, with a reformed [[Fidget]]. She states that every time she visits Basil, she knows that something is up. When she went inside, she heard about the Sideshow Sea Beast from [[Basil]] and [[Dr. David Q. Dawson|Dawson]]. She keeps an open mind just like Dawson and called on Fidget and [[Toby]] to head on out to the carnival. On the way to see the beast, Fidget showed her how some tricks were done, including how the levitation works.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*Providing the voice of Olivia was Susanne Pollatschek's only acting role she has done to date.\n*In Frank Angones' unproduced pitch for a ''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]'' reboot, Olivia would have been portrayed as Basil's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who eventually founded the [[Rescue Aid Society]].<ref>[https://mobile.twitter.com/FrankAngones/status/1231806155208327168 Chip had grown up obsessed with a secret organization known as The Rescue Aid Society, a group of rodents and other animals that have been secretly helping humanity since it was formed in Victorian London by Basil of Baker Street's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Olivia Flaversham.]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{The Great Mouse Detective}} \n{{DEFAULTSORT:Flaversham, Olivia}}\n[[pt-br:Ol\u00edvia Flaversham]]\n[[ru:\u041e\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0438\u044f \u0424\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043c]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Mice]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Great Mouse Detective characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Scottish characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Tritagonists]]"
