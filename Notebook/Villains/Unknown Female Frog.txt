She is one of the former friends of [[King Andrias]] along with a [[Unknown Toad Warrior|toad warrior]].\n\n==Background==\n===Physical appearance===\nShe is a pink female frog with blonde hair wearing a hood. She also kind of resembles [[Sprig Plantar]].\n\n==Role in the Series==\n===Before===\nOver 1,000 years before the events of the show, [[King Andrias]] was friends with a frog and a toad.\n\nHowever, it is implied that Andrias' friends stole the [[Calamity Box]] from under his watch, hid it on Earth and stopped Newtopia's years of development. As more time went by, Amphibia forgot about Newtopia's old legacy.\n\n===Season 2===\nShe only appears in a torn portrait that was hidden away deep within Andrias' [[Newtopia Castle|castle]] and in a flashback when Andrias revealed his true dark agenda.\n\n===Season 3===\nShe appeared with the music box on an ancient jar displayed at the Natural History Museum. It served as a clue to the connection to Amphibia and earth.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFemale Frog Profile.png\nKing Andrias in the past.PNG\nFile:Amphibia Another Clue.png\n</gallery>\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Amphibia}}\n[[Category:Amphibia characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Frogs]]"
