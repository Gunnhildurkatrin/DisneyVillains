The next day when Ursula wakes up she finds George has left and wonders why he didn't say goodbye to which she asks Arthur and Beatrice to which Beatrice reveals that she had a talk with George and that he should let Ursula marry Lyle to which angers Ursula but she soon learns that she loves George and decides to return to the jungle but is stopped by her mom who tells her no and tells Arthur to say something to which Arthur supports his daughter by telling her to be careful.\n\nTo which Ursula kisses her dad and thanks him for his approval and leaves and when Beatrice tells Arthur to do something he replies \u00a0\"What would have me do? There's obviously no stopping her.\" To which Beatrice takes a sip of her drink and tries to follow Ursula and stop her to which after she leaves the room Arthur says in frustration underneath his breath how much of a pain Beatrice is to him. \u00a0\n\nArthur appears in the end at the of the film at George and Ursula's wedding with Beatrice to which she tells him that she wishes that he would do something about all the monkeys because she feels like Jane Goodall to which Ape says \"Madame, I knew Jane Goodall, and you are no Jane Goodall.\"\u00a0At the wedding, Arthur dances with his daughter and George gives him a handshake, a hug, and raffles his hair to which Arthur likes his new son-in-law.\n\n===''[[George of the Jungle 2]]''===\nArthur doesn't appear in the sequel nor is he mentioned. This could be either because he possibly divorced Beatrice or he may have passed away.\n\n{{George of the Jungle}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stanhope, Arthur}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:George of the Jungle characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Grandparents]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:American characters]]"
