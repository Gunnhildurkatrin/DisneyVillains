Yin is training to master the mystic style of Woo Foo, and is currently at the second level. Yin's voice is provided by [[Stephanie Morgenstern]], a Swiss-born American actress and screenwriter who is famous among the anime community for being the dub voice for the ''Sailor Moon'' character Minako Aino/[[w:c:sailormoon:Sailor Venus (anime)|Sailor Venus]].\n\n==Personality==\nYin is intelligent, cute, and sassy but quite stubborn. She is a neat freak, which is seen often. Yin is always attracted to bad boys. This may be because in the philosophy of Yin and Yang, Yin is the name of darkness, while Yang is the name of light. In the episode \"[[Falling Yin Love]]\", she falls in love with 'Brett' (Yuck in disguise). She is also a shopaholic. She has a pretty good sense of right and wrong, and usually does the right thing. She can be mean and will sometimes do whatever she wants to do, whether it is right or wrong. She can also come up with good plans. She is also very good at playing the keyboard. In the episode \"[[Old Softie]]\", it is shown that before she finishes saying something, she can come up with different words to say something else; and in the episode \"[[Dance, Dance, Devastation]]\", it is shown that she is a good rapper, dancer, and singer and that she can also speak some Spanish and German though this may have been because of the game controlling her. She tends to demonstrate her competitive streak, again most evident in \"Dance, Dance, Devastation\". It is listed that she is a bedwetter.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Yin's voice actress, Stephanie Morgenstern, is also popular in the video game industry for providing the voice of Regina, the main protagonist of the Capcom survival horror video game series, Dino Crisis.\n*Yin can also be compared to Ryu of Street Fighter, another Capcom property, considering their noble and compassionate, yet competitive, personality and that their main focuses are the mystic and spiritual sides of their fighting styles (Ryu's trademark move, the Hadouken, and Yin's array of Woo Foo spells).\n*Conversely, her brother, Yang, is similar to Ryu's friend/rival Ken Masters, as they prefer the martial arts aspects of their fighting styles (Ken's Shoryuken and Yang's bamboo weaponry) and have a similar fiery personality; they mostly prefer to act without thinking the situation through and are quite stubborn.\n*Yin and Ryu are also similar in the fact that both characters have temporarily turned to the side of evil, while Yang and Ken (not counting the time when Yang was possessed by Mastermind and the time where Ken was brainwashed by M. Bison and his Violent Ken form in SVC Chaos: SNK Vs. Capcom) have yet to become evil themselves.\n*Yin and Yang's Relationships similar to [[Sashi Kobayashi|Sashi]] and [[Penn Zero|Penn]]'s Relationships from ''[[Penn Zero: Part-Time Hero]]''.\n*In [[The Gig is Up]] she can play her Keyboard.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nYin.jpg\nYin.png\nBaby yin yang.png\nYin-Yang-&-Yo.png\nyin-yang-yo_03.jpg\nYin Yang Hug.jpg\nHuman Yin Yang.png|Yang and Yin as humans.\nQuit your sorority.png\nWoo Foo Knights in less traing.jpg\nEvil Yin.png\nWonder Tweens.png\nYin Yang aura swap.png|Yin and Yang's auras are swapped.\nyin_and_yang_by_trainboy48-d9eqe1k.jpg\nyin wins a ball.png\nyang says sister with robot.png\nyin angry faces at yang.png\nyin getting mad at yang.png\nyin rages says master yo.png\nyin says about chip.png\nyin seeing chip.png\nyin turns around at chip.png\nchip laughs at yin.png\nchip says out of dojo.png\nYang was training with his sword.png\nYin and yang gets stuck in tv.png\nYin and lina after yang was gone.png\nMaster yo says strange and magical.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Wikipedia}}\n{{Yin Yang Yo!}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Rabbits]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Yin Yang Yo! characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Twins and Triplets]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Martial Artists]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]\n[[Category:Non-Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Orphans]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]"
