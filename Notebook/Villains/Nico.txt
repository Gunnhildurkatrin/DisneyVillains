He is Skylar's little brother and one of his Guardian of Avalor trainees.\n\n\n\n==Role in the [[Elena of Avalor|series]]==\nNico first appears in \"[[Flight of the Jaquins]]\" when he arrives from Vallestrella, the home realm of the Jaquins, for Guardian Training with [[Ciela]] and [[Avion]] on the orders of his father, [[King Verago]]. When he see Skylar, Nico is happy to be flying with his brother again. On the way to Avalor City, Nico spots the Pueblo De Oro, the home of the Noblins. When Skylar explains that the [[Noblins]] are magical shapeshifters that have the Golden Touch, Nico begs his brother to stop there. Upon arrival, Nico quickly gets the group stalled by constantly begging for \"one more game\" with the Noblins continuously. [[Princess Elena]], Migs, and Luna show up and tell Skylar that he is late. When the trio sees Nico, Migs instantly realizes what was keeping Skylar while Luna explains that everytime Skylar and Nico get together \"it's playtime all the time.\" When Skylar realizes that Ciela and Avion are missing, the group goes looking for them. They find a mark that Luna identifies as the mark of [[Troyo]] the magical coyote, who Nico learns is has been an enemy of Avalor's Jaquin Clan ever since they banished him from the jungle after he kept tricking people into doing bad stuff for him so he can be King of the Jungle. When Elena, Migs, and Luna all scold Skylar for losing track of time and his trainees with someone like Troyo around, Nico tries to defend Skylar by saying it's actually his fault but Skylar agrees with his friends and says it ''is'' all his fault for not sticking with the plan and the two brothers take off to rescue his teammates. They arrive in time to see Troyo trap Elena, Migs, and Luna too. Working with the Noblins, the two brothers defeat the coyote and free their friends.\n\n==Trivia==\n*[[King Verago]], the Jaquin King, is Skylar and Nico's father.\n*In \"[[Realm of the Jaquins]]\", Nico, Ciela, and Avion become full fledged guardians.\n*being King Verago's son Nico must have inherited the green of his wings and Skylar inherited the blue \n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"180\">\nFlight-of-the-Jaquins-14.png\nFlight-of-the-Jaquins-5.png\nEp22RealmOfTheJaquins14.png\nElena of Avalor Realm of the Jaquins.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Elena of Avalor}}\n[[Category:Elena of Avalor characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Jaguars]]\n[[Category:Hybrids]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Mystical animals]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Princes]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Parrots]]"
