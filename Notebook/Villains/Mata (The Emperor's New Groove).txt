She would have been voiced by Laura Prepon.\n\n==Intended role==\nMata was originally to have been a love interest for [[Kuzco]] who would have aided him on his journey, and later married him. She appears to have had a sarcastic personality, which included calling Kuzco \"llama boy\".\n\nShe was designed by Joe Moshier, while Sandro Cleuzo was to have been her supervising animator. The name Mata was eventually used for [[Mata|the waitress at Mudka's Meat Hut]].\n\n[[Malina]], Kuzco's love interest from the TV series seems to be based on Mata.\u00a0\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\ntumblr_n4yciwUF8o1qi8pxqo1_1280.jpg\ntumblr_n4yciwUF8o1qi8pxqo5_1280.jpg\ntumblr_n4yciwUF8o1qi8pxqo2_1280.jpg\ntumblr_n4yciwUF8o1qi8pxqo3_1280.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Despite being drawn only in sketches, Mata bears a slight resemblance to [[Shanti]] in ''[[The Jungle Book 2]].''\n* With [[Kuzco]]'s love interest [[Malina]] being based on Mata, whose name would be eventually used for the [[Mata|waitress]], ''[[The Emperor's New School]]'' only partially made good on the ''Kingdom of the Sun'' concept.\n* If seen closely, Mata resembles the brides Kuzco was to pick out, possibly inspired by her design.\n\n==Animation test==\n<gallery>\nKingdom of the Sun The Emperor's New Groove Mata Test\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Emperor's New Groove}}\n[[Category:The Emperor's New Groove characters]]\n[[Category:Deleted characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Peruvian characters]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]\n[[Category:Tritagonists]]"
