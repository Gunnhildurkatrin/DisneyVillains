Despite being a musician, Bobby still lives with Suga Mama. He, Suga Mama and his father did many things together, excluding Oscar and making him resentful when he recalls the memories.\n\nBobby did not get kidnapped by Al Roker like the other adults since he's a kid at heart and mentions that his mother has been gone for a week.\n\nHe also cannot swim. This is strange cause in the episode \"Strike\", its revealed that Suga Mama and Percy paid for years of swimming lessons. \n\nBobby is also a singing celebrity as he sings songs like \"Dis-funktionall\" and he did them on a music video. He's usually singing everything he says, except when he was to stop to ask questions\u00a0out of confusion or because there's no one around besides those who don't like his singing. Bobby also owns a car that can transform into a mailbox, which he implies helps him avoid cops who try charging him with parking tickets. Oscar is not above abusing him; he once sent Bobby as an invitation to [[BeBe & CeCe Proud|Bebe and Cece]]'s baptism to their overweight cousins, [[Ray Ray Proud, Sr.|Ray Ray]] and [[Boonnetta Proud|Boonnetta]] (who ate Oscar and Trudy's wedding cake before they even got a chance to cut it). He also seems to have a romantic crush on Trudy's actress sister, [[Diana Parker]].\u00a0\n\n== Relationships ==\n\n* [[Oscar Proud]] - Bobby's baby brother. Even though Oscar has always been jealous of Bobby getting all the attention from their parents, Bobby never rubs it in or looks down on his brother. While there have been moments where they annoy each other, they seem to have a close brotherly/friend relationship. He is happy to help Oscar out with his business (especially if music is involved). \n* [[Suga Mama]] - Bobby's mother. Suga Mama spoiled him when he was a kid and gave him all the love and attention he needed while Oscar was often ignored. Because of this, the two of them do have a loving mother/son relationship, something that Oscar wishes he had.\n* [[Trudy Proud]] - Bobby's sister-in-law. The two of them don't have many scenes together but they seem to have a good relationship. There have been times where Bobby does something that will annoy Trudy but they do treat each other like family. They also seem to be very accepting of each other as family as they do often introduce the other as their \"brother/sister-in-law\".\n*[[Penny Proud]] - Bobby's niece. The two of them seem to have a loving uncle/niece relationship.  Penny is always smiling and affectionate when Uncle Bobby comes to visit (unless she is already in a bad mood). Bobby has also helped Penny with her music career and even became her manager. During this time, Penny had to leave her friends behind but she never stabbed Bobby in the back. Even when Penny gave an acceptance speech for a music award, she gave the biggest shout out to Bobby saying he was someone who was like a father to her.\n*[[BeBe & CeCe Proud]] - Bobby's nephew and niece. Bobby doesn't have many scenes with them but when he does, he is usually seen playing with them (or eating their food). \n*[[Felix Boulevardez]] - Felix and Bobby have a surprisingly solid friendship. They have been paired up together on numerous occasions and appear to get along and work together pretty well. \n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"229\">\n0745747.jpg\n13453.jpg\n0769769.jpg\n858585.jpg\n885868.jpg\n5353553.jpg\n5464545.jpg\n6656656.jpg\n7745745.jpg\n85856868.jpg\n95656568.jpg\nBobby and Oscar Movie.jpg\n345345.jpg\n0235325.jpg\nSlider 3.png\nVlcsnap-2013-05-17-18h01m08s255.png\nVlcsnap-2013-09-01-12h00m21s157.png\nVlcsnap-2013-09-05-21h48m55s171.png\nVlcsnap-2013-09-05-21h50m48s255.png\nVlcsnap-2013-09-05-22h03m58s3.png\nVlcsnap-2013-09-05-22h14m15s40.png\nVlcsnap-2013-09-05-22h15m19s161.png\nVlcsnap-2013-09-05-22h15m39s103.png\nVlcsnap-2013-09-05-21h57m41s36.png\nVlcsnap-2013-09-12-10h50m29s208.png\nVlcsnap-2013-09-12-11h04m01s137.png\nProudghost8.png\nVlcsnap-2013-09-12-11h07m45s67.png\nVlcsnap-2013-09-13-11h57m39s245.png\nVlcsnap-2013-09-13-11h58m15s240.png\nVlcsnap-2013-09-13-11h59m13s160.png\nVlcsnap-2016-06-04-22h43m12s499.png\nVlcsnap-2013-09-13-12h11m34s156.png\nVlcsnap-2015-04-26-20h40m07s453.png\nBobbypajamas.png\nBobbyteddybear.png\nBobbyhappy.png\nBobbysad.png\nOscarfamilychicken.png\nBobbysingsitbaby.png\nProudfamilyplan.png\nFelixbobbymask.png\nBobbyko.png\nBobbyouch.png\nBobbyout.png\nFelixbobbyscream.png\nFelixbobbypain.png\nFelixbobbylaugh.png\nFelixbobbypained.png\nBobbyduck.png\nBobbyduckkiss.png\nBobbycantswim.png\nBobbysingduck.png\nVlcsnap-2016-07-10-13h59m15s311.png\nVlcsnap-2016-07-10-14h24m20s375.png\nBobbyband.png\nScreen_Shot_2021-04-08_at_11.27.06_AM.png|Uncle Bobby's redesign in The Proud Family Louder and Prouder\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Proud Family}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Proud, Bobby}}\n[[Category:The Proud Family characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Uncles]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
