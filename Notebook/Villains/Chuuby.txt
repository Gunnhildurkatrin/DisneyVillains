He lives in a perch just above the Runamuck Railroad station and is very friendly to guests; often trying to entertain them.\n\n===Development History===\nChuuby was an original character created for the attraction ''Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway''.  According to Disney imagineer Kevin Rafferty, Chuuby was originally intended to be named, \"Chubby\" but there was a typo during one of the development meetings and they all found the name Chuuby much more endearing.\n\n==Appearances ==\n\n===Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway===\nOn this attraction, Chuuby is encountered twice.  Chuuby is first seen at the beginning of the ride, overtop of the train tunnel you pass through in the load-area.  The second time you encounter Chuuby is as you exit the main-ride into the unload area.  Here Chuuby is seen overhead, chirping and dancing to entertain you as you wait for your train to be the next to unload.\n\n==External Links==\n{{Mickey Mouse & Friends}}\n{{Mickey Mouse (TV series)}}\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Passeriformes]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse (TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Dancers]]"
