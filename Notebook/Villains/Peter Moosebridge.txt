In most releases (including the North American one), he appears as the default male news anchor character. However, certain countries have released different animals exclusively.\n==Role in the film==\nPeter Moosebridge, along with [[Fabienne Growley]], his co-anchor, only makes two brief appearances in the film. First, the two are seen reporting the bad news in [[Zootopia (location)|Zootopia]]\u2014labeling it as a \"city gripped by fear\"\u2014where a caribou was critically injured from a mauling by a savage polar bear, and a protest against a peace rally organized by [[Gazelle]].\n\nHe and his co-anchor appear one final time when they report [[Bellwether]]'s arrest for conspiring the predatory attacks on Zootopia, [[Mayor Lionheart|Lionheart]]'s denial of his knowledge of Bellwether's plot and claim of his actions of the illegal imprisonment of the savage animals to be \"done for the right reasons\", and an antidote to [[Night howlers]] proving effective in rehabilitating the infected predators.\n\n==International portrayals==\nIn certain releases, Moosebridge was replaced by a different newscaster. This is similar to what happened in the Pixar film\u00a0''[[Cars 2]]'', here the character of Jeff Gorvette is replaced by a different racer in certain releases.\n\n<tabber>Brazil=\n\n[[File:BoiChai.png|thumb|left|200px]]\n\nIn the Brazilian version, a jaguar named '''On\u00e7ardo Boi Ch\u00e1''',<ref>Full name given in the Brazilian credits.

Specifically, he was designed to be a Canadian moose to reference Mansbridge's nationality.\n*In the version screened in the UK and Ireland, BBC Radio 2 sports reporter Vassos Alexander voiced the character; the moose was renamed Moosos Alexander accordingly. However, this version sadly did not end up in the UK home release of the film, though \"Zootopia\" is still replaced with \"Zootropolis\".\n*David Koalabell has a brief silent cameo near the end of the US version when Lionheart is interviewed.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nZootopia-9.png|Peter and his co-anchor, Fabienne Growley.\nPeterMoose.png\nZootopia Poster.jpg\nPeterMoosebridge-Zootopia.png\nPeterMoosebridgeZootopiaNews.png\nPeterMoosebridgeZootopiaNews2.png\nmoose-zootopia.png\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}{{DEFAULTSORT:Moosebridge, Peter}}\n\n{{Zootopia}}\n[[ar:\u0628\u064a\u062a\u0631 \u0645\u0648\u0633\u0628\u0631\u064a\u062f\u062c]]\n[[fr:Peter Moosebridge]]\n[[Category:Zootopia characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Moose]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:News Reporters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Characters based on real people]]"
