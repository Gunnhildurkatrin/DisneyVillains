"{{Infobox_character|image=Chiron.jpg|shows = ''[[Hercules: The Animated Series]]''|voice = [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]|inspiration = The mythical figure|personality = Arrogant, macho|occupation = Hero trainer|status = Active}}\n'''Chiron''' is a character from ''[[Hercules: The Animated Series]]''. A centaur, Chiron's a trainer of heroes like [[Philoctetes]] (to whom Chiron serves as a rival), though Chiron's students were, as a whole, much more successful than Phil's students (at least until Hercules came along). He has experience with actually being a hero himself rather than just being a trainer of heroes.\n\n==Appearances==\n=== [[Hercules and the Caledonian Boar]] ===\nWhen a Caledonian Boar sends Phil's hunting trailer over a cliff, Chiron ends up rescuing the hunting party and joining them, taking time to gloat about his success as a hero trainer and hunter. When Artemis turns Phil into a boar, Chiron and the other hunters begin pursuing him (not realizing what happened), with Hercules, having been tasked by Artemis to protect the boars, having to stop them. \n\n=== [[Hercules and the Phil Factor]] ===\nAt a scroll signing, Chiron argues that Phil isn't qualified to be a hero trainer if he isn't a hero himself, prompting Phil to try at hero work himself. Chiron's training scrolls that Hercules reads throughout the episode highlight the centaur's arrogant dismissive nature.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the television series, it has been stated that Chiron was once a real hero at one point in his life. But in traditional Greek Mythology, Chiron was never a hero, he was a healer, an astronomer and a philosopher. Although he did go on to train many who went on to become Greek Heroes themselves (including Hercules), so calling him a hero trainer isn't entirely inaccurate.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Hercules}}\n[[Category:Hercules characters]]\n[[Category:Centaurs]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Greek Mythology]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Greek characters]]\n[[Category:Hybrids]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Horses]]"
