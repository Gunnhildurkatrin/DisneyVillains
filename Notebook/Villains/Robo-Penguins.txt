They are designed and programmed to collect weather data for the Tomorrowland Transit Authority.\n\n==Description==\nThe Robo-Penguins are so named is because they look like penguins. Under their wings are their battery life indicators. Because they are not built for speed the Robo-Penquins are known to be very slow, but they are fast when they slide down hills or when they are being chased. While all Robo-Penguins look the same, one in particular is nicknamed \"[[Bowtie]]\" because he wears a blue bow tie on his chest and is a friend to [[Mirandos]].\n\nThe Robo-Penguins are stationed on the Polar Icecap at the top of planet [[Tempestoro]], which is where their charging station is based. During big storms, the Robo-Penguins are programmed to go into their charging station. Recharging their power supply is essential for the Robo-Penguins, because if they run out of power they will lose all of their data.\n\nRobo-Penguins also have a heat mode of their own, which turns their black coloration to bright orange; while in heat mode, the Robo-Penguins are able to melt away thick layers of ice via touch. \n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"180\">\nBowtie the Robo-Penguin cocnept.png|Concept Art\nBowtie.png|Bowtie\n</gallery>\n\n{{Miles from Tomorrowland}}\n[[Category:Penguins]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Miles from Tomorrowland characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]"
