But after being tricked into thinking someone actually liked him, his feelings got hurt which led to him crying.\n\n==Role in the Series==\nThe Giggling Goblin makes his debut appearance in \"[[Too Cute to Spook]]\". He first appears when Sofia, Lucinda, Calista, Lily, and Indigo get stranded in the Dreary Woods. The Goblin uses his Giggle Spells to steal the group's candy. The witches try to stop him but he takes their wands. Calista defeats him by giving him Lemon Sours. They then take him trick or treating where he helps them get more candy from Mr. P, who gives him his own. The group invites him to trick or treat the next year.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Sofia the First}}\n[[pt-br:Duende Risonho]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Goblins]]\n[[Category:Sofia the First characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
