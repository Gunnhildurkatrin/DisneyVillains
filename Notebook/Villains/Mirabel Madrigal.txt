She wears green round-framed glasses, and a white shirt with black trimming on it and colorful butterfly stitching on it and in the middle of her dress it has her name stitched on it. She wears a light blue long skirt with colorful butterfly prints on it and sandals with pink linking on it. She also wore a blue (or indigo) petticoat and white bloomers. Additionally, she wears blue earrings.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nMirabel has no powers, unlike the rest of her family, but she does appear to possess some knowledge of playing the accordion, though not perfectly.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Mirabel is not only the fourth Disney animated protagonist to wear glasses (after [[Milo Thatch]], [[Chicken Little]], and [[Lewis Robinson]]), but the first female protagonist to do so.\n**Initially, during the \"Vanellope and the princesses\" sequence in ''[[Ralph Breaks the Internet]]'', [[Snow White]] was to reveal she was actually nearsighted and needed glasses. There was even some merchandise portraying Snow White wearing glasses, but, for some reason, this trait was dropped.\n*Early in production, the character's name was Mariana.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thedisinsider.com/2020/12/09/exclusive-new-details-for-walt-disney-animation-studios-encanto/|title=Exclusive: New Details for Walt Disney Animation Studios\u2019 \u2018Encanto\u2019|website=The Disinsider|last=Sharpe|first=Josh|date=December 9, 2020|access-date=July 8, 2021}}</ref>\n*Mirabel is the second human female protagonist from the [[Disney Animated Canon]] to debut in 2021, after [[Raya]] from ''[[Raya and the Last Dragon]]''.\n**This marked the first time in history that two human female protagonists from two different Walt Disney Animation Studios films debuted in the same year.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nEncanto poster 2.JPG\nEncanto Mirabel Poster.jpg\nFile:5 y-o Mirabel Madrigal.png|5-year-old Mirabel.\nMirabel Madrigal pose.png\nMirabel still 1.png\nMirabel still 2.png\nMirabel still 3.png\nMirabel still 4.png\nMirabel still 5.png\nMirabel still 6.png\nMirabel still 7.png\nMirabel still 8.png\nMaribel and Toucan.jpg\nEncanto-PromoPicture-02.jpg\nEncanto-PromoPicture-03.jpg\nEncanto-PromoPicture-06.jpg\nEncancoPromo.jpg\nEncanto-Family is Everything.png\nEncanto-LittleGoldenBook.png\nThe Ultimate Disney Encanto Sticker Book.png\nEncanto-El don de una familia The Gift of Family.png\nEncanto family.jpg\nEncanto-family-tree-4789609-949x1200.jpg\nDisney's Encanto visual development and concept art.webp\nEncanto dance progression.webp\nMirabeldoll.jpeg\nMirabelsingingdoll.jpeg\nLEGO Encanto - Antonio's Magical Door set.jpg\nLEGO Encanto - Isabela's Magical Door set.jpg\nLEGO Encanto - The Madrigal House set.jpg\nFunkoPOP-1145-MirabelMadrigal.png|[[Funko]] [[Funko/Disney/Pixar|POP!]] Mirabel Madrigal\nMirabelsingdoll.jpg|Mirabel singing doll from shopDisney\nMirabelsingbox.jpg\nMirabel plush doll.webp|Plush doll of Mirabel from shopDisney\nMirabel-madrigal.png\nMirabel-madrigal2.png\n</gallery>\n\n==Reference==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{stub}}\n{{Encanto}}\n{{Disney Emoji Blitz}}\n[[pt-br:Mirabel Madrigal]]\n[[ja:\u30df\u30e9\u30d9\u30eb\u30fb\u30de\u30c9\u30ea\u30ac\u30eb]]\n[[es:Mirabel Madrigal]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Upcoming characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Encanto characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Nieces]]\n[[Category:Cousins]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]\n[[Category:Characters who narrate the story]]"
