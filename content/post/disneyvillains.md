# Motivation
When we think of Disney films, we feel a rush of nostalgia, as if we were watching one of those films with a bowl of cereal on a Sunday morning. We all have our favourite characters and we all have that one villain that we are a little bit afraid off. Therefore, it was an easy decision to take a further look into the villains of Disney, and explore the characters which we are still to this day gradually a little bit afraid of in a new light.


# Dataset

The dataset was extracted from the Disney Fandom Wiki webpage, and it contains all the character villains from Dinsey. That includes characters from different universes, e.g Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars, Walt Disney and other. After having built and visualised the network, we decided to narrow the scope and maintaining at least some possibility of analysing information about the dataset, do to lack of internal connections in the whole Disney Villains dataset. We then chose to select a subset of the data, that represents one universe, Marvel.
