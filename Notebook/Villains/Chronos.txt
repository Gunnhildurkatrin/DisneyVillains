When it comes to Dahlia's plan to help her fall in love with him, Chronos also does the same thing like finding someone to fall in love with.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===''[[Destino]]''===\nWhile seen as a statue that [[Dahlia]] gazes upon, Chronos does not physically appear until during the part where Dahlia goes into perfect shape just as he comes to life by restraining the liquid from the statue of himself to which he manages to escape from it. He then sees Dahlia (in the form of a dandelion seed), causing him and Dahlia (who transforms back to her normal form) to be separated from her, just as Dahlia notices that she is being separated from her.\n\nStuck between walls in the ruins, Dahlia summons birds to help Chronos find a way out so that he can find his way to reunite with her just as he leaves the find Dahlia to which Chronos has trouble finding her. Chronos appear in front of Dahlia and embraces her. At the end of the short, Chronos returns to his lifeless form, minus the part where the bird used to be but with Dahlia in the form of a bell tower to which she found the perfect fit for her.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In Greek mythology, Chronos \"engendered\" by \"earth and water\". As the God of Time, he was responsible for the first generation of Gods. Due to having a similar sounding name, he is often mistaken for [[Kronos]], father of [[Zeus]].\n*When adorned in his baseball attire, Chronos somewhat resembles baseball player Lou Gehrig. Dal\u00ed was obsessed with baseball, not because he knew anything about the game, but because he thought of it as the perfect connection with American audiences.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nDestino-disneyscreencaps.com-338.jpg\nDestino-disneyscreencaps.com-424.jpg\nDestino-disneyscreencaps.com-428.jpg\nDestino11.jpg\nDestino 6.png\nDestino4.jpg\nDestino-disneyscreencaps.com-592.jpg\nDestino-disneyscreencaps.com-610.jpg\nDestino-disneyscreencaps.com-615.jpg\nDestino-disneyscreencaps.com-620.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Fantasia}}\n[[Category:Fantasia characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
