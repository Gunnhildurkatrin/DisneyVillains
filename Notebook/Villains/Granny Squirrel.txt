McCall [https://books.google.ca/books?id=ALmJCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA72 page 72]: \"Martha Wentworth (Madame Mim/Granny Squirrel)\"</ref> is a character in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[1963]] feature film ''[[The Sword in the Stone]]'', who briefly appeared in a scene where she sees Merlin disguised as a squirrel and quickly falls in love with him. Her chittering noises are provided by Martha Wentworth who is also the voice of [[Madam Mim]] in the same film.\n\n==Personality==\nThe granny squirrel is funny, prissy, eccentric, annoying, excitable, and crazy about male squirrels. She becomes terrified and frustrated when she learns that Merlin was a grumpy old man instead of a squirrel.\n\n==Role in the [[The Sword in the Stone|film]]==\nIn the film, the granny squirrel is first seen meeting Merlin as a squirrel eye to eye, face to face, when Merlin sang \"A Most Befuddling Thing\". Later, she keeps pestering him, even though Merlin tried to keep her away from him and tell her that he was an old human man, not a squirrel. She even kissed him and kept sniffing him (which proves that she was getting to know him).\n\nWhen Merlin fell down the branch when she kept following him and grab by the tail, he fell into a pile of leaves, and the granny squirrel ran down the tree and ran over to the leaves. However, when Merlin turned himself back into a human, she was at first scared, then angry at this, and Merlin scares her away by barking.\n\nIt is unknown what her fate was after the events of the movie.\n\nShe never appears in the rest of the film.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The granny squirrel seems to resemble a female version of [[Gopher (Winnie the Pooh)|Gopher]] from ''[[Winnie the Pooh (franchise)|Winnie the Pooh]]''.\n*It is possible that Granny Squirrel is the [[Girl Squirrel]]'s grandmother. But it's unlikely that she is.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nFat Squirrel.jpg\nGranny Squirrel 1.jpg|Granny Squirrel hugging Merlin as a blue squirrel\nSquirrel Kissy.JPG|Granny Squirrel kissing Merlin as a blue squirrel\nGranny Squirrel 2.jpg\nThe End of Merlin.JPG|Old Lady Squirrel watches Merlin fall into a pile of leaves\nSword-in-stone-disneyscreencaps.com-5458.jpg|Granny Squirrel scared by Merlin's human form\nFurious With Humans.JPG|Granny Squirrel furious with Merlin's human form\nCynophobia.JPG|Old Lady Squirrel runs up the tree with Merlin barking at her\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Gopher (Winnie the Pooh)]]\n\n{{The Sword in the Stone}}\n[[Category:The Sword in the Stone characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Squirrels]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
