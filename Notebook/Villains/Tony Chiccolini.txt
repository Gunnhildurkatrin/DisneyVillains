He is a major recurring character. He was dating [[Jessie Prescott|Jessie]].\n\n==Characteristics==\nTony is the Ross building's handsome doorman. He is of Italian descent and has a New York accent and slick, black hair. Tony is a slight airhead, but still really funny. He is very proud of his epaulets. He's also a very loyal and understanding person, as well as an all around nice guy, and is in love with Jessie. He's really close friends with the Ross family. But Emma and Morgan have been messing up his name (Emma called him Tommy and Morgan called him Timmy).\n==Character History==\nBefore becoming a doorman, he met J.J. Mayfield and gave him $2,000 to make him a famous kazoo player. Sometime in the course of the year he found out the truth and became a doorman, which is ironic because J.J Mayfield said he could \"open doors\". It is possible that his family was wealthy- as he paid $2,000 and his family have their own restaurant but they may have lost their money due to J.J Mayfield.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Jessie Prescott - Friend/Ex-Girlfriend===\n[[File:Jessie_and_Tony-S1_E20.jpg|thumb|Tony with Jessie in \"Tempest in a Teacup\".|left|223x223px]]Tony first meets Jessie in New York, as the new Nanny, and instantly falls for her.
