He unintentionally makes Max feel rejected after spending time with P.J., but the boys later make up. He is the son of [[Harold Hatchback]], both of them only appearing in one episode.\n\n===Personality===\nCoop is a kind soul who detests seeing others get picked on. While his intentions are always good, occasionally the results are not what he expected, such as when he accidentally \"stole\" P.J. away from Max, when he was only trying to be friendly. However, once he realizes his error, he sets out to make it right.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nCoop is a muscular anthropomorphic dog with red fur. He wears a light green tee-shirt with dark green cuffs on the sleeves, brown pants, purple and white sneakers, and white gloves.\n\n===Role in the series===\nCoop's only appearance is in the episode \"[[Buddy Building]]\". He appears to have known [[Max Goof|Max]] and [[P.J.]] for a long time, as Max recognizes him and refers to him by his old nickname, Coopie. After saving them from the bully [[Leech (Goof Troop)|Leech]], Max becomes dejected after P.J. begins to favor Coop over him. However, by the end of the episode, the trio set things straight. His father, [[Harold Hatchback]], is rivals with P.J.'s father, [[Pete]]. They are both car salesmen who try to outdo each other.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Coop's voice actor, Conor Duffy, is the son of Harold's voice actor, Patrick Duffy.\n*Coop's name is likely a pun on \"hatchback coupe\" and alludes to the fact that his father is a car salesman.\n\n{{Goof Troop}}\n[[Category:Goof Troop characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]"
