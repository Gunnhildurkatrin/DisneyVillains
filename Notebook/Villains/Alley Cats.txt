We gotta split.|[[Scat Cat]] to alley cats sent by [[Roquefort]] for help}}\n\nThe '''Alley Cats''' are friends of [[Scat Cat]] who appear in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[1970]] animated feature\u00a0film, ''[[The Aristocats]]''.\n\n==Background==\nThe alley cats are a jazz band: Shun Gon ([[China|Chinese]] Cat) plays the piano and drums made out of pots, Hit Cat ([[England|English]] Cat) plays the acoustic guitar, Peppo ([[Italy|Italian]] Cat) plays the concertina, Billy Boss ([[Russia]]n Cat) plays the double bass, and their boss [[Scat Cat]] plays the trumpet. Together, they play jazz music while their boss usually sings.\n\n===Members===\n<tabber>\nScat Cat=\n{{Main|Scat Cat}}\n|-|Shun Gon=\n[[File:Aristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-6962.jpg|thumb|left]]\nShun Gon ([[Paul Winchell]]) is a [[China|Chinese]] Siamese cat (inspired by [[Si and Am]] from ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'') who plays the piano and drums. He is often seen playing his instruments with chopsticks. In the comics, his name is Chino.\n|-|Billy Boss=\n[[File:Aristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-6903.jpg|thumb|left]]\nBilly Boss ([[Thurl Ravenscroft]]) is a [[Russia|Russian]] cat who is often seen playing the double bass (which he usually plucks). In the comics, his name is Boris.\n|-|Peppo=\n[[File:Aristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-6657.jpg|thumb|left]]\nPeppo ([[Vito Scotti]]) is an [[Italy|Italian]] cat who wears a red bandanna with white polka dots and a green hat which he frequently tips to others (like [[Duchess]]). He is often seen playing the concertina. In the comics, his name is Luigi.\n|-|Hit Cat=\n[[File:Aristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-6661.jpg|thumb|left]]\nHit Cat (Lord Tim Hudson) is an [[England|English]] cat who wears purple glasses and a blue beaded necklace as a reference to the hippies prominent in the [[1960]]s. He is often seen playing the acoustic guitar. In the comics, his name is Cyril.\n</tabber>\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[The Aristocats]]''===\nThe alley cats are first seen after [[Thomas O'Malley]] leads [[Duchess]] and her weary kittens to his [[Alley cats' apartment|penthouse]], where jazz music can be heard from inside. Duchess still insists on spending the night here, so O'Malley allows them to stay and introduces his friends\u00a0[[Scat Cat]] and his gang of alley cats\u00a0making live music together. While playing their instruments, the alley cats and their boss all sing \"[[Everybody Wants to Be a Cat]]\". O'Malley and Duchess join in the fun, as do [[Berlioz]], [[Marie]], and [[Toulouse]]. During the song, O'Malley and Duchess perform a dance number, and Duchess sings a wonderful solo while playing the harp; which the alley cats find so beautiful, soft, lovely, and romantic until they get back to playing their instruments (with the help of Scat Cat's trumpeting) and make their way out of the penthouse along with other alley cats.\n\nThe alley cats are seen again when [[Roquefort]] meets with them and tries to get them to help save Duchess and her kittens from [[Edgar Balthazar|Edgar]], but is unable to remember O'Malley's name. The alley cats prepare to eat him, but Roquefort yells out the proper name in frustration when asked for last words. The alley cats head off to help O'Malley, leaving Roquefort to chase them down in an attempt to lead them to the correct house. Coincidentally, this also led to a Frenchman to consider giving up drinking wine after he witnessed a mouse (Roquefort) seemingly chasing the cats. Believing he was hallucinating, the Frenchman poured his wine onto the ground.\n\nThe alley cats reappear when Edgar attempts to ship Duchess and her kittens to Timbuktu. They pile on top of the butler, screeching and clawing, while Roquefort manages to release Duchess's family by cracking the trunk's combination lock, abruptly yelling for silence in order to hear better. The alley cats defeat Edgar by locking him in the trunk and pushing it outside. The alley cats then watch as Edgar is shipped off to Timbuktu instead.\n\nThe alley cats are last seen in [[Madame Adelaide Bonfamille|Madame Bonfamille]]'s mansion, which she opens up to all the alley cats of Paris. Scat Cat and his alley cats celebrate by playing their instruments around the grand piano in Madame's piano room downstairs, singing a reprise of \"Everybody Wants to Be a Cat\".\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\nIn the show, Scat Cat, O'Malley, and the other alley cats were all a part of the popular band \"O'Malley and the Alley Cats\". However, as a running gag in the show, something or someone would prevent the band from playing.\n\n== Disney Parks ==\n[[File:Vintage Aristocats Walkarounds.jpg|thumb|282x282px]]\nIn the 1970s and 80s, three of the Alley Cats recreated in the psychedelic colors of \"Everybody Wants to Be a Cat\" often appeared at Disneyland and the Magic Kingdom. Scat Cat was given bright orange fur, Peppo was made pink and Hit Cat was turned yellow. Eventually, these costumes were retired and the walkaround representation of the film would focus on the three kittens. {{The Aristocats}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:The Aristocats characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Bands]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Chinese characters]]\n[[Category:Italian characters]]\n[[Category:English characters]]\n[[Category:Russian characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Music groups]]"
