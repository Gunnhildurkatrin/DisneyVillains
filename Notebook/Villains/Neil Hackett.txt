Wells Junior and Senior High School always in a sweater vest, even when out of school. Apparently at some point in time he was in the army. He is very paranoid about aliens and when on screen almost always tries to prove the Diffys are aliens or tries to uncover their secret.\n\nHe was born in Wookstock, [[New York]] in [[1969]] in a drumcircle, which was discovered by [[Pim Diffy|Pim]] via her wizard. He is also very sensitive about his baldness, always trying methods to cure his baldness. Always getting pranked by Kyle Speckle who he eventually expels from the high school. He has had an unpleasant run-in with [[Curtis]].\n\nWhen he is not fulfilling his duties as vice principal, he teaches, his specialty being math. He is very easily fooled despite his assertions to the contrary. He has problems with the ladies and displays both low and high self-esteem when it comes to the opposite sex and has a dog named Roswell.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nCorner Pocket (42).jpg\nCorner Pocket (36).jpg\nCorner Pocket (37).jpg\nCorner Pocket (38).jpg\n</gallery>\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hackett, Neil}}\n[[Category:Phil of the Future characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Principals]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
