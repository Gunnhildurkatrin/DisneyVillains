They have fluffy hair and big white eyes.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In [[Roblox]], a game created by user Alexnewtron known as ''Meep City'' uses the Puffles from Club Penguin and are known as \"Meeps\". The main difference is that unlike Puffles, Meeps do not have hair, and also feature slightly larger eyes.\n**What makes this particularly interesting is that the game was featured in an official event sponsored by [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]\u2022[[Pixar]]'s [[Coco (film)|Coco]], where golden musical note variants of the Meeps appeared as models that the player would need to collect on the then-new Melody map as part of Meep City Racing to receive [[H\u00e9ctor's Guitar]] as a virtual gear for your Roblox avatar.\n\n{{Club Penguin}}\n[[Category:Club Penguin]]\n[[Category:Club Penguin characters]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
