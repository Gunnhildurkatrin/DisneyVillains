He is [[Dave Dennison|Dave]] and [[Jenny Dennison|Jenny]]'s son and [[Dani Dennison|Dani]]'s brother.\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Personality ===\nMax is shown to be a youthful teenager and it is seen that he can become a gloomy teenager. He is shown to be stubborn, yet also brave and caring for others (such as with [[Thackery Binx]]'s situation), determined, and intelligent (as shown as he tries to defeat the Sanderson Sisters).\n\n=== Physical appearance ===\nMax is a teenager, approximately 14 years old, with brown hair and green eyes. He has fair skin and is seen throughout the film, first wearing a tie-dye shirt (much to his teacher [[Miss Olin]]'s amusement) to wearing a brown jacket with a blue shirt and jeans.\n\n==Role in the film==\nAt the start, Max is shown to be angry because he and his family just moved from [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] to Salem, [[Massachusetts]]. He misses his friends and doesn't quite fit in with his classmates who believe in the supernatural mythology. One particular classmate he has a crush on is [[Allison (Hocus Pocus)|Allison]].\n\nMax is shown to rather dislike Halloween and does not believe in magic or the supernatural, believing Halloween to simply be an invention for confectionery companies to make additional profit. Thus, he is rather displeased at having to take Dani trick-or-treating, thus taking his anger out on Dani, causing her to become upset with him, but Max apologizes and she forgives him soon after. When visiting the [[Sanderson Sisters' Cottage|Sanderson sisters' cottage]] with Dani and Allison, he cynically lights the [[Black Flame Candle|black flame candle]], disbelieving it will resurrect the [[The Sanderson Sisters|Sanderson sisters]], against Dani and Allison's wishes. However, he is shocked when his lighting of the candle does indeed resurrect the sisters and thus is forced to fight and defeat them before sunrise with the help of Dani, Allison, and [[Thackery Binx]]. He is shown to rather cunning when dealing with the sisters; he exploits their lack of understanding and knowledge of the 20th century and tricks them into believing he is a wizard who can summon \"the burning rain of death\" (in reality water from fire sprinkles) and that Allison's car headlights are in fact a sign of early sunrise. During the final battle in the graveyard with the sisters, in order to free Dani from Winifred's clutches, he consumes the [[Life Potion|life potion]], making himself liable to life absorption. Just as [[Winifred Sanderson|Winifred]] attempts to consume his life force, she touches the hallowed ground of the graveyard and is thus petrified due to inherent unholiness, and is then reduced to green dust by\u00a0sunrise, allowing Max to live. After the whole ordeal, he officially becomes Allison's boyfriend.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\n\nHocus-disneyscreencaps.com-2491.jpg|Max with Dani\nHocus-pocus-disneyscreencaps.com-3372.jpg|Max, Allison, & Dani\nHocus-disneyscreencaps.com-8164.jpg|Max with Allison\nHocus-disneyscreencaps com-9692.jpg|Max sacrifices his life force to save Dani.\nHocus-disneyscreencaps com-9875.jpg|Max tries to knock Winifred off her broomstick.\nHocus-disneyscreencaps.com-3786.jpg|Max lights the black flame candle.\nHocus-pocus-disneyscreencaps.com-1486.jpg|Max in class\nHocus-Pocus Three.jpg\n201464 full.jpg\n201462 full.jpg|Max & Dani on Halloween\n92206 full.jpg\nHocus-pocus salt.jpg|Rehearsal shot of salt scene\nHocus-Pocus 20Things 1.jpg\n92201 full.jpg\nHocus-Pocus Green-Light.jpg\nHocus-pocus-30th-anniversary-look-back-9.jpg|Behind the scenes\n\n</gallery>\n\n{{Hocus Pocus}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dennison, Max}}\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Hocus Pocus characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]"
