She is the ex-wife of [[Bill Green]] and the mother of [[Cricket Green|Cricket]] and [[Tilly Green]] who got out of jail.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nShe is shown to really love her family, especially Cricket who she gave [[Phoenix]] to. She is most likely a tough woman as it is stated in \"[[Cricket Versus]]\" that she wrestled a wolverine sometime \"between the wedding and honeymoon\".\n\nNancy is a bit of a wild child. She considers herself a rebel and proudly shows it off. However, she has since softened to being a responsible parent and grown-up ever since her incarceration. Now she simply wants to get back to family life and become a better person and earn Bill and Alice's acceptance.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nShe is a tall, slender woman who, just like her family, has yellow skin. She has long, curly bright red hair and has freckles on her face with a pastel pink lipstick. Nancy usually wears a violet tank top that barely shows her midriff and skinny jeans with a belt buckle and cowboy boots. She wears silver earrings and has tattoos that cover her left arm.\n\nHer biker attire consists of a black leather jacket and a red helmet that covers her face.\n\n==Role in the [[Big City Greens|series]]==\nShe made her first introduction in the episode \"[[Phoenix Rises]]\", when Cricket's dog Phoenix smells Nancy she goes off to find her and when everyone realizes she is gone they go looking for her. Before doing so Cricket tells [[Remy Remington]] how his mother found Phoenix after a fire burned down their barn. Later on Phoenix tracks Nancy's scent to a bikers only bar, Nancy recognizes her and brings her home. Once the Green family sees Nancy has gotten out of jail, everyone but [[Gramma Alice]] is happy to see her.\n\nIn \"[[Uncaged]]\", it is revealed that she was sent away to prison for trying to liberate cows from a dairy factory. She has since tried to apologize for her sins and simply wants to live with her family in relative peace. This made difficult however by her son's crazy antics.\n\nMore of her history is revealed in \"[[Trailer Trouble]]\" where it is shown that she was once a biker in a gang called the Stingers, but that she quit so that she could be with Bill and their kids.\n\n==Relationships==\n===[[Cricket Green]]===\nNancy loves Cricket unconditionally. It is apparent that much of Cricket's behavior emerges from her own characteristics as they share similar traits, most notably their catchphrase: \"Bingo-bango\". Because of this, Nancy usually gives Cricket carte blanche whenever he gets a hair-brained scheme and will even go alongside it to pleased herself as seen in \"[[Impopstar]]\". However, she is not above recognizing when Cricket has gone too far or needs help. Nancy honestly realizes that Cricket is better than her because of him still being young and naive and wishes him to never make the same mistakes she did. In \"[[Shark Objects]]\", Nancy begins to see that her negative traits do indeed have consequences and comes to the realization that she needs to be a better role model for her son. She has since become a much more present mother for Cricket, as well as Tilly, and tries to be the \"fun\" parent between her and Bill.\n\n===[[Tilly Green]]===\nNancy adores her daughter Tilly. She is aware of her strange and sensitive personality and because of this tries to be very cautious around her. Nancy thinks of Tilly as being too pure to be corrupted and realizes that she will usually do the right thing. Just like with Cricket, Nancy tries to present herself as the fun parent to Tilly, but she is glad to see that she wants her to just be a helping mother.\n\n===[[Bill Green]]===\nNancy and Bill's relationship is intricate. Through exposition, it is obvious that Nancy and Bill loved each other so much that they welcomed two children into the world. Since Nancy's incarceration, the two have divorced and became more like two close friends. Nancy tends to tease Bill and his more straight-laced attitude towards dealing with things, but despite this, she enjoys his group and continues to take part in different activities with him. Though it is unknown if they still love one another, they definitely still seem pretty close.\n\n===[[Gramma Alice]]===\nNancy and Alice have a rivalry, or rather, Alice has a rivalry with Nancy that from her perspective is not much. Nancy finds Alice amusing and is quick to poke fun at her old ways. However, she does apparently want some kind of approval from her, but usually finds her antics annoying. Nevertheless, the two have since started to make amends starting with \"[[Valentine's Dance]]\" where Nancy points out that many of her negative traits are similar to hers. Since then, the two of them have begin to become closer while still playfully teasing with one another.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Just like Bill, Nancy does not have a hillbilly accent like her children.\n*Nancy shares many traits with Cricket such as exclaiming \"Bingo-bango\" and keeping a hidden exit/entrance in the bottom drawer of her cupboard.\n**She also shares many traits with Tilly, such as her freckles and fearless, free-spirited personality and in \"[[Greens' Acres]]\", Nancy was shown to have buckteeth similar to her in her childhood.\n*Nancy is the only Green family member who does not have a short \"i\" in her name.\n*Chris Houghton stated that Nancy was too hard to write for in earlier episodes because the studio was worried that she was very bad of a parent or never care about her children enough.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chrishoughton.tumblr.com/post/187732656257/who-would-you-say-is-the-trickiest-character-to|title=Tumblr Nancy Post|website=Tumblr|date=September 15, 2019}}</ref>\n*Nancy is based on the Houghton Brother's mother's friends who all just so happened to be named Nancy.
