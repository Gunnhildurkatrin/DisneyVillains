All he can apparently do is make a feeble meowing noise. He likes hearing Samson's stories about the wild, although none of them were true. One day, Ryan inadvertently provokes a gazelle stampede, which promptly invokes Samson's anger over losing the turtle curling championship. After Samson scolds Ryan and lectures him about not being able to roar, Ryan sneaks into a green transport box and winds up getting shipped to [[Africa]]. He is later kidnapped by [[Blag]], one of [[Kazar]]'s wildebeest henchmen, and taken to a dormant volcano.\n\nAfter reuniting with his father and learning the truth about where Samson came from, Ryan eventually finds his inner roar (which he uses to defeat Kazar) and heads back home with his father, the [[Central Park Zoo|zoo]] animals, and Kazar's former minions.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nSnapshot_156.png\nImagesCA94C1HD.jpg|Ryan with his father Samson\nimagesCASBPD8E.jpg\nRealWildChild.jpg|Ryan sees a board poster of a Lion\nwild1.gif|Ryan Spots one of the green transport boxes\nImagesCA9FM0H1.jpg|Ryan in a green transport box\nRyan gets taken away.png|Dad!
