In [[Elmer Elephant|the original short]], she invites Elmer to her birthday party, and [[Elmer Elephant (character)|he]] later rescues her when her house catches on fire. She has also appeared alongside [[Elmer Elephant (character)|Elmer]] in comic book stories.\n\n==Background==\nTillie first appears in the [[Silly Symphonies|Silly Symphony]] ''[[Elmer Elephant]]''. She tries to blow out the candles on her cake, but her breath isn't strong enough. She asks Joey Hippo to help her out, but he ends up blowing the cake all over Elmer, who has just arrived with a bunch of freshly picked flowers. After she cleans Elmer off, Tillie gladly accepts the flowers and kisses Elmer on the trunk. She heads up the winding staircase to her tree-house and tells him she'll be right back.\n\nLater on, Tillie's house has caught fire, leaving her trapped at the top. The other children and the fire brigade try to rescue Tillie, but all attempts end with the flames driving them off. Tillie tries scrambling to higher ground, but the flames continue to rise. Elmer finally arrives with the help of an elderly giraffe and a bunch of pelicans. Elmer uses his trunk to extinguish the flames and saves Tillie before she falls. Tillie thanks Elmer for rescuing her, and the two share a kiss.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Her clothing seems to be based off of [[Minnie Mouse]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"180\" captionalign=\"center\">\nTillie holds her skirt.jpg|Tillie holds her skirt.\nElmerElephant TillieTiger.png\nElmer Elephant2.jpg\nTillieTiger Model.jpg\nFifer and fiddler elmer and tillie in toby tortoise returns.jpg|Tillie, along with Elmer, makes a cameo appearance in ''[[Toby Tortoise Returns]]''\nCarriedAway2.jpeg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Silly Symphonies characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Tigers]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Deuteragonists]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse (TV series) characters]]"
