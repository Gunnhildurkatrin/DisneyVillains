'''Experiment 249''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba_Jookiba|Jumba Jookiba]]\u00a0and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]]. She is designed to use her spring-like body to launch boulders. Her one true place is helping people reach high heights.\n\n==Background==\n===Physical appearance===\nSproing is a dark navy blue and white koala-like experiment. She vaguely resembles [[Stitch]] with a coiled, spring-like body, a large white patch on her face, a wide mouth, red round nose, large, dark eyes, and two small ears and antennae.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nSproing can launch boulders by using her spring-like body, bounce and jump really high. She is able to hold heavy weights with her strong coils.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment 249 was the 249th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. She was designed to launch boulders. 249 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.\n\nAt some point, 249 was activated, captured, tamed, and named Sproing.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nSproing was seen when [[Lilo_Pelekai|Lilo]] was making her rounds with [[Scrump]] to check on all of the experiments, and she finished up near the movies, where Sproing was\u00a0elevating\u00a0a man who was changing the letters on the display outside the theater.\n\nLater, the first\u00a0624 experiments, including Sproing, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium\u00a0to be destroyed. However, Lilo, [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]] and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed\n\nSproing participated in the following battle between the experiments and the\u00a0[[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]] by trapping Leroys in her coils.\n\nHowever, the Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Her unique design is a reference to {{WikipediaLink|Slinky}} toys.\n*Sproing is one of the few experiments who does not appear in the group photo at the end of ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nVlcsnap-2012-07-03-20h53m06s93.png\nVlcsnap-2013-03-06-18h34m12s116.png\nvlcsnap-2013-12-21-10h44m59s206.png\nVlcsnap-2013-02-08-11h58m00s88.png\nVlcsnap-2013-07-07-21h52m56s50.png\nscreenCapture 29.12.13 21-59-19.jpg\nscreenCapture 29.12.13 22-06-02.jpg\nVlcsnap-2012-08-02-19h21m37s94.png\nVlcsnap-2013-05-21-14h37m30s94.png\n249 - Sproing.png\nStitch Now - Sproing.jpg|Sproing in ''[[Stitch!Now]]''\n</gallery>\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
