The [[Cherubs]] who spot him feel just as bad as he does and copy his every move. Then another cherub comes along and shows them [[Melinda]], a female centaur who is also mateless. The cherubs have an idea: they decide to bring the two together. Melinda blushes as Brudus takes her by the hand. The two sit under a pavilion as the cherubs close the curtains (though one stays behind to take a peek). Brudus later takes Melinda under a tree when it starts raining and the two-step outside into the sunlight when the rain stops. Brudus and Melinda are last seen slumbering peacefully at the end of the segment.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps com-6471.jpg\nfantasia-disneyscreencaps_com-9155.jpg|Brudus hasn't had any luck finding a mate.\nfantasia-disneyscreencaps_com-9158.jpg\nfantasia-disneyscreencaps_com-9173.jpg\nfantasia-disneyscreencaps_com-9179.jpg\nfantasia-disneyscreencaps_com-9261.jpg\nfantasia-disneyscreencaps_com-9274.jpg\nfantasia-disneyscreencaps_com-9277.jpg\nfantasia-disneyscreencaps_com-9279.jpg|Brudus cheers up when the cherubs play music for him.\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-9280.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-9281.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-9284.jpg|Brudus gets up and follows the cherubs to hear more music.\nfantasia-disneyscreencaps_com-9298.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-9301.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps_com-9312.jpg|Melinda and Brudus meet for the first time.\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps_com-9318.jpg|Melinda blushes as Brudus kisses her hand.\nfantasia-disneyscreencaps_com-9327.jpg\nfantasia-disneyscreencaps_com-9330.jpg\nfantasia-disneyscreencaps_com-9339.jpg\nfantasia-disneyscreencaps_com-9353.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-9360.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps com-9767.jpg|\"Oh, no!
