He is an overweight, sunburned (except for where he sometimes wears a tank top) man who wears sunglasses, swim trunks, and flip flops. Whenever he appears, his ice cream drops from its cone before he can finish it. He is currently nameless and mute, except in \"[[Swirly (episode)|Swirly]]\" when he clucks like a chicken after being hypnotized by [[Swirly]] as well as in \"[[Babyfier (episode)|Babyfier]]\" when he yells after tripping over 151's pod and crying after [[Babyfier]] turns him into a baby.\n\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Though he is voiced by [[Frank Welker]], he rarely speaks; only giving an occasional sigh or moan.\n**He does have lines in the [[Disney Adventures]] comics.\n*In \"[[Richter (episode)|Richter]]\", he tried to have a milkshake but like with his ice cream, it fell from one Richter's vibrations.\n*[http://phineasandferb.wikia.com/wiki/File:Excuse_me%3F.jpg A man who looks similar to him] makes a possible cameo appearance in the ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'' episode \"[[Phineas and Ferb Hawaiian Vacation]]\".\n*Ice Cream Man has appeared in every major media in [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|the franchise]], including ''[[Stitch!]]'' and ''[[Stitch & Ai]]''.\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n{{Disney Crossy Road}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Infinity characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Crossy Road characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Magic Kingdoms characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
