She only appears in \"[[Puppy Love (Goof Troop)|Puppy Love]]\". She was P.J.'s first love interest. She appeared as a student in his and Max's class. P. J. became smitten after hearing her read her poem aloud in class. Though some classmates didn't like it, upsetting her that she threw her poem in the trash. P.J. recovered her poem and tried to get her attention. Though being shy he didn't have the courage to tell her. During one of his attempts, Rose mistakes Max for her secret admirer and asks him to the dance.\n\nMax determined to help P.J. decides to make his persona unlikable to Rose. One of his plans is to use P.J.'s \"date\" to ditch Rose for. P.J.'s more embarrassed to find his date is really Peg in disguise; though only Pete fails to see that. That plan almost goes well until Pete interferes, the school dance becomes a food fight, and Rose is left confused and embarrassed.\u00a0\n\nP.J. attempts to console her and reads her poem aloud, revealing he was her secret admirer. Finally alone, the two share a dance together.\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\n1992-dingo-68.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Notes==\n* Prior to her debut, her animation model was used in the episode \"[[Dr. Horatio's Magic Orchestra]]\" for a sousaphone-playing member of the Spoonerville Elementary school band that [[Pete]] was a member of back when he was ten years old.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Goof Troop}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Goof Troop characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]"
