This episode features a number of clever parodies of works by famous artists, such as [[wikipedia:Grant Wood|Grant Wood]], [[wikipedia:Salvador Dal\u00ed|Salvador Dal\u00ed]], and [[wikipedia:Pablo Picasso|Pablo Picasso]].\n\nHer second appearance was in the episode \"Paint Misbehavin',\" where it was revealed that she, like her creations, is actually painted, possibly by herself. In this episode, she was melted when splashed with turpentine. It is implied by [[Launchpad McQuack|Launchpad]] that she is actually aware that she herself, along with the entire universe of the TV series, is actually animated/painted by \"some higher being.\"\n\n[[File:Splatter_Pheonix's_revival.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Splatter Phoenix is revived in ''Darkwing Duck'' #6.]]\nSplatter Phoenix's popularity with the viewers eventually led to her being brought back in [[Joe Books]]' ''[[Darkwing Duck (Joe Books)|Darkwing Duck]]'' comic book. In issue #6's story, an in-universe comic book artist (who resembles the comic's artist, [[James Silvani]]) is asked by a fan to draw Splatter Phoenix, which he does use a new supply of ink provided to him by [[Phantom Blot|a mysterious benefactor]]. When he does, though, Splatter Phoenix rises from the drawing, and upon seeing that she's at a comic book convention, begins wreaking havoc. Darkwing and Honker spot her and chase her into several comic books (fittingly, with the art style changing with each one), along the way finding out that she is bound by the logic of the comic worlds they go into. They eventually manage to put her in an ad for Mostess\u2122 Veggie Pies (a parody of [[wikipedia:Hostess|Hostess]] Fruit Pies) and then closing the comic while she's distracted eating the snacks.\n\nIn issue #8, the comic book in which Splatter Phoenix is sealed is shown being brought to St. Canard's new maximum-security prison while a curious [[Negaduck]] watches, implying that he plans to team up with her.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Phoenix is one of the few characters in the series to die onscreen, the other being [[Major Synapse]].\n*Phoenix's death in the show is closely similar to [[Theodora the Wicked Witch of the West|the Wicked Witch of the West's]] in the 1939 film, ''The Wizard of Oz'' (The Witch is melted by water; Phoenix is melted by turpentine).\n*Tad Stones has stated that, in hindsight, he feels he should've put Splatter Phoenix in the Fearsome Five instead of Negaduck.<ref>[https://twitter.com/TadStones/status/1170542051579973639 Tweet by Tad Stones]</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" position=\"center\">\nSplatter_Phoenix_2.jpg\nSplatter003.JPG\nSplatter006.JPG\nSplatter009.JPG\nSplatter010.JPG\nSplatter012.JPG\nSplatter014.JPG\nSplatter023.JPG\nSplatter025.JPG\nSplatter034.JPG\nSplatter045.JPG\nSplatter050.JPG\nSplatter058.JPG\nSplatter061.JPG\nSplatter078.JPG\nSplatter079.JPG\nSplatter084.JPG\nSplatter088.JPG\nSplatter100.JPG\nSplatter101.JPG\nSplatter103.JPG\nSplatter016.JPG\nSplatter090.JPG\nSplatter038.JPG\nSplatter094.JPG\nSplatter Steals Smile.png\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Darkwing Duck}}\n[[Category:Darkwing Duck characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Artists]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
