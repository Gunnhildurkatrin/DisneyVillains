Smelding assisted Hightower in his colonial pillaging and plundering esplanades, including a statue stolen from an [[Raging Spirits|ancient temple]].\n\nIn 1899, Smelding and Harrison stole a deity idol from the Congo called [[Shiriki Utundu]] from the native Mtundu tribe.  Archibald was always superstitious of the idol and warned Harrison to respect the idol, with the proud Harrison not listening.  On New Year's Eve, Hightower used the idol to extinguish his cigar and as a result summoned the wrath of the deity which subsequently spirited the hotel magnate away.\n\nLeft without his master, Archibald went broke and became homeless, even having been locked up in a mental-institute from 1902-1908.  He would come to be fixated with bringing back his lost master and manipulated [[Beatrice Rose Endicott]] of the ''New York Preservation Society'' into declaring the hotel a historic site and hosting tours within it.  Archie did this as he believed the sacrifice of tourists would appease Shiriki Utundu and lead to the release of Hightower's ghost who would reward Archie with his life long-since lost.\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n=== The Tower of Terror ===\nPortraits and murals of Smelding with Harrison on their adventures can be seen throughout the entrance of [[Hotel Hightower]].\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nTower of Terror 10.jpg\nEgypt-balloon-with-sarcophagi.jpg\nTower of Terror Hotel.jpg\n</gallery>\n{{Tower of Terror}}{{Society of Explorers and Adventurers}}\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Servants]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tower of Terror Characters]]\n[[Category:S.E.A. characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
