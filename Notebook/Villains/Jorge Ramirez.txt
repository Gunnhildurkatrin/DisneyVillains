He is a young Hispanic boy who is [[Ravi Ross|Ravi]]'s friend. It is possible that he was abducted by aliens. Jorge is a notorious fibber with lots of energy. He talks a lot and is a bit hyper. He becomes friends with Ravi, but sometimes puts him in uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous situations. The other campers don't like how often he tells lies, but are generally nice to him.\n\n\n==Background==\nJorge is from Denver, Colorado. He has a baby sister, a mother, a father, a grandma and a grandpa, and a crazy aunt. They are all blond/blonde, except for him. They often fight with each other, and his mom cooks terribly. Jorge then wanted to attend Camp Kikiwaka, where he met Ravi, [[Xander McCormick|Xander]], Emma, [[Lou (BUNK'D)|Lou]], and [[Tiffany Chen|Tiffany]].\n\n==Trivia==\n*He didn't finish reading the title of ''[[Wikipedia: The Cat in the Hat|The Cat in the Hat]]''\u00a0and he said his motto is: \"Don't Read.\"\n*He says his family, parents, grandparents, aunt, and sister are all blonde, so how he got his black curly hair is unknown. He may be adopted, or have had a black haired ancestor that carried the gene to him.\n*He is probably based on [[Woody Fink]] from ''[[The Suite Life on Deck]]''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nJorge.jpg\nBunk'd cast and characters.jpg\nBUNK'D Seaon 2 Promo.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Bunk'd}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:BUNK'D Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
