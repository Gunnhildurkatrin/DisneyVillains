She is [[Carol of the Arrow (character)|Carol's]] second in command and one of her Helping Hands.\n\n==Role in the Series==\nUnlike Carol and the other Helping Hands who helped others because it's the right thing and out of kindness, Jane helped others to boost her image and feed her ego. When she and Carol met Sofia and Carol invited the young Princess to join the Merry Band (unaware that Sofia was a princess), Jane immediately became jealous of her and sabotaged her at every turn to keep her from joining the Merry Band. After Sofia was revealed to be a Princess, she blamed her for everything that happened stating \"I say we forget about little miss Princess here and go save that raccoon ourselves.\" without shame but did start to feel guilty after Sofia flew away heartbroken. When Jane tried to save the baby raccoon, she fell on the log, which got drifted away in the rough river, and she couldn't swim. When Sofia and Minimus came to her rescue, Jane admitted she was jealous because she was afraid of losing her spot to her, but she learned that there's room for both of them.\n\n==Trivia==\n*She is voiced by Liliana Mumy who also voiced [[Elliot, Amy and Kurt|Amy]] in \"[[Substitute Cedric]]\". Unlike Amy, Jane reforms after being saved and apologizes to Sofia. They are both dark-skinned.\n*Jane is the second character to be envious of Sofia, the first being her older sister, [[Princess Amber|Amber]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nCarol-of-the-Arrow-2.png\nCarol-of-the-Arrow-17.png\nCarol-of-the-Arrow-18.png\nCarol-of-the-Arrow-20.png\nSofia the First - Any Deed For Those In Need.jpg\nCarol of the Arrow Jane Baby Raccoon 02.jpg\nCarol of the Arrow Hold on.jpg\nCarol of the Arrow Are you kidding.jpg\nCarol of the Arrow Welcome to the Merry Band.jpg\nCarol of the Arrow Sofia excited.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Sofia the First}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Jane}}\n[[pt-br:Jane (Princesinha Sofia)]]\n[[Category:Sofia the First characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Archers]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]"
