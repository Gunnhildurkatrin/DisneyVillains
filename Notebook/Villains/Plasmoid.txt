'''Experiment 617''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]]. He is designed to attack by firing balls of plasma from his scorpion-like tail. He was captured by [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]], but was rescued in \"[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]\".\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment 617 was the 617th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to shoot plasma balls from his scorpion-like tail. 617 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.\n\n617's pod eventually\u00a0made its way to a junk shop, where it, along with [[Hammerface|033]], [[Heat|609]], and [[Thresher|544]], was\u00a0discovered, stolen, activated, and named Plasmoid by [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] in \"[[Dupe (episode)|Dupe]]\".\n\nBack at [[Gantu's Ship|his ship]], Gantu trained and conditioned Hammerface, Heat, Thresher, and Plasmoid\u00a0by using [[Reuben|Experiment 625]] for target practice, much to his indignity. The four henchmen experiments were then led by Gantu in an attack on the [[Lilo's House|Pelekais' house]], where their boss ordered them\u00a0to defeat and capture [[Stitch]] and his replicas after seeing that he had been divided into four.\n\nWhile his teammates each battled one of the clones, Plasmoid engaged the original Stitch in a duel. Plasmoid attacked by firing plasma balls at Stitch, only for the latter to dodge them all. The scorpion-like experiment then fired a plasma blast at an overhead lamp. Stitch taunted Plasmoid, saying he missed, but this was proven wrong as the lamp then fell on Stitch's head, knocking him out. Gantu finished the battle by placing Stitch in a containment orb along with his clones.\n\nAfter capturing\u00a0Stitch and his duplicates, the five returned to Gantu's ship for a victory feast (courtesy of Reuben), but were interrupted by [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Pleakley]], and [[Dupe]]. After\u00a0Lilo tricked Gantu into using Dupe's cloning ability, Gantu used Dupe to clone Plasmoid into a hundred replicas. However, as Plasmoid's power was divided among them, they all became complete weaklings, and thus were easily defeated.\n\nPresumably after this, they were all sent to [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]] who was somehow able to re-merge\u00a0the weakling Plasmoid clones into the original.\n\nPlasmoid reappeared in\u00a0\"[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]\", and was freed along with Gantu's other captive experiments by Lilo, Stitch, and several other experiments in a rescue mission. He also helped with the experiment escaping by breaking Gantu\u2019s gun in half with a plasma blast allowing [[Tank (Lilo & Stitch)|Tank]] to eat it.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nThe first 624 experiments, including Plasmoid, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium\u00a0to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]] and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nPlasmoid participated in the following battle between the experiments and the\u00a0[[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]] by firing plasma blasts at attacking Leroys.\n\nThe Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.\n\n===''[[Stitch!]]''===\nPlasmoid has appeared twice in the ''Stitch!'' anime, both times with [[Splodyhead]]. In the first appearance, Plasmoid and Splodyhead combated\u00a0[[Stitch]] when he was hypnotized by [[Swirly]] into fighting for [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]. In the\u00a0second appearance, Plasmoid and Splodyhead were modified by H\u00e4msterviel to attack Stitch. Plasmoid was given a new ability of vacuuming up objects and using them as projectiles. In \"Shogun\", it is shown that Plasmoid was dehydrated back into an experiment pod and locked in [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]]'s vault.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n==Trivia==\n*Plasmoid is one of the\u00a0ten known experiments named by someone other than Lilo, the other\u00a0nine being [[Gigi]], [[Elastico]], [[Yaarp]], [[Hammerface]], [[Heat]], [[Thresher]], [[Morpholomew]], [[Shrink]], and [[Leroy]].\n*Plasmoid, [[Bugby]], and [[Clink]] are the only known experiments that are hexapods. Interestingly, all three have characteristics similar to different arthropods.\n*Even though we saw Plasmoid in\u00a0[[Experiment Pods|pod]] form, he was technically activated off-screen.\n**Plasmoid's pod color is yellow according to \"[[Ace (episode)|Ace]]\".\n*Plasmoid appears in the online game ''[[Lilo & Stitch: Alien Interception]]'' along with [[Tank (Lilo & Stitch)|Tank]], [[Dupe]], [[Clyde (Lilo & Stitch)|Clyde]], [[Yang]], and [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]].\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Bugs]]"
