His occupation is currently unknown. [http://www.s8.org/gargoyles/askgreg/search.php?qid=5303] He is frequently subjected to Margot's sharp tongue and seems to be quite the henpecked sort.\n\nBrendan may not be as hostile towards gargoyles as his wife. When [[Thailog]] stabbed [[Goliath]] during the Halloween Masque at the [[Eyrie Building]], Brendan, who was costumed as a gargoyle, witnessed the battle and alerted Dr. Sato that somebody needed medical help. ''(\"Bash\")'' [http://www.s8.org/gargoyles/comment/archive/index.php?archive_date=2007-07-23]\n\nLike his wife, Brendan is a protestant Christian.
