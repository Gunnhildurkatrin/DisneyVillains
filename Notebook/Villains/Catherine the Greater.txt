They later stand next to each other near [[Holt Farrier|Holt]] just as he introduces them by name. After a reminder from [[Ringmaster|Max Medici]], Catherine and the other workers continue building the tent. The next day, they gaze upon [[Dumbo (character)|Jumbo Junior]], recently born to [[Mrs. Jumbo]] in awe. Catherine and Ivan later entertain guests at nighttime in front of some guests in the sideshow section. Later after the incident with the elephant act due ro Mrs. Jumbo's rampage at the circus causing it to collapse, Ivan (who has a coffee mug) gives his wife coffee with Mrs. Jumbo put into confinement as he calmly comforts her while [[Miss Atlantis]] calmly sings \"[[Baby Mine]]\".\n\nThe next day, Catherine and the other performers sadly gaze upon Mrs. Jumbo being taken away just as Dumbo, as he is now called, is sent to perform in the clown act, no longer including him in the elephant act. Later during his next one, Catherine and Ivan watch him in the role of a firefighter clown and as the platform begins to collapse due to one of the [[clowns]]' clumsiness, Catherine and Ivan become fearful about this; thanks to Milly's help, Dumbo manages to fly around the tent.\n\nFurthermore, Catherine and the other performers travel to an amusement park called Dreamland in [[Arkansas]] as Dumbo's act was a success. After it is found out that Vandevere Enterprises has fired all the performers, Holt, Joe, Milly, and the performers plan to rescue Dumbo by releasing him back into the wild alongside Mrs. Jumbo. Catherine plays an important role in arriving at [[Nightmare Island]] which Dumbo and the other performers barge into as she and Ivan work together to put in the fog effects to distract the dangerous animals and turn off the lights to confuse the guards just as the performers take the transport vehicle with Mrs. Jumbo inside just before the park owner, [[V.A. Vandevere]], and his guards try to stop the circus troupe. Later, Catherine, Holt, Joe, Milly, and the rest of the performers spend their last moments with Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo before they get released into the wild.\n\nAt the end of the film, Catherine and Ivan are seen releasing a dove as part of a new policy of not including wild animals in the circus.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Her name is derived from Catherine the Great, a historical figure from [[Russia]].\n*According to the English Audio Description, she is identified as having Latin American roots.\n\n{{Dumbo}}\n[[Category:Dumbo characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in remakes]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Circus performers]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]"
