As the series went on, Professor Owl was phased out as the host of the videos, instead only appearing at the beginning to introduce either [[Jiminy Cricket]] or [[Ludwig Von Drake]] as the video's host. In the All-Time Favorites videos and the beginning of the \"Honor to Us All\" video, the Professor was only heard in voice over.\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]] ''===\nProfessor Owl can be seen in the opening sequence to ''[[House of Mouse]]'' as well as in the episodes \"[[Where's Minnie?]]\" and \"[[Ask Von Drake]]\".\n\n==Trivia==\n*The character [[Merlin (Legend of the Three Caballeros)|Merlin]] in ''[[Legend of the Three Caballeros]]'' bares a striking resemblance to Professor Owl.\n*The shape of Professor Owl, among other things, served as the inspiration for the character of [[KnowsMore]] in ''[[Ralph Breaks the Internet]]''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nRarities-03.jpg\n5813291308 a7a2517110 z.jpg|In [[Mickey's Soundsational Parade]].\nProfessor.JPG\nOwls houseofmouse.jpg|Professor Owl with other owls at the ''[[House of Mouse]]''\nOwls houseofmouse2.png\nProfessor Owl.jpg|Professor Owl in the ''House of Mouse'' theme song\nProfessor Owl animation cel.JPG\nProfessorOwlFlying.png\nProfessorOwlMusicLand.png\nProfessor Owl Disney Sing Along Songs Intro Up Down and Touch the Ground.JPG\nKahl-toot-Owl.jpg|Concept sketches by [[Milt Kahl]]\nOWLMODEL.jpg|Model sheet\nBovO400IAAI46CO.jpg large.jpeg\nTumblr_n7nnb1UNGP1qhcrb0o8_r1_1280.jpg\ndiamond13.png\nVlcsnap-2014-06-28-22h12m20s87.png\nPicture_14.jpg\nPicture_15.jpg\nWalt meets prof owl.jpg|Prof. Owl meets [[Walt Disney]]\nImg 0483.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{House of Mouse}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Schoolteachers]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Owls]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]"
