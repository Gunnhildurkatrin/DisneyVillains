He was once married, but his wife died sometime before the time period of the first film. He has one daughter, [[Pocahontas (character)|Pocahontas]]. He is initially prejudiced towards the white settlers, but later changes his ways thanks to Pocahontas who convinced him not to go down a path of hatred.\n\nChief Powhatan appears to be middle-aged; however, he is still a powerful and respected warrior, as he has led his tribe to battle on at least two known occasions. His most distinctive clothing consists of a feathered headdress and a buckskin cape that he later gifts to [[John Smith]]. He appears to be a wise leader, though his distrust of the white settlers almost gets the best of him.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Pocahontas (film)|Pocahontas]]''===\nPowhatan appears early in the film, having just returned from a successful war campaign against an aggressive tribe. That night, he proclaims a feast in honor of [[Kocoum]], who had distinguished himself as the bravest warrior. Later, he reunites with Pocahontas. Pocahontas relates a dream that she recently had, telling him she believes that it means something exciting will happen. Powhatan reveals to her that Kocoum has asked to marry her. Pocahontas is somewhat reluctant, but Powhatan believes it is the right path for her. He gives Pocahontas a necklace that her mother wore when she married Powhatan and counsels Pocahontas that the people will look up to her as she is the Chief's daughter.\n\nWhen white settlers appear on the shore, Powhatan orders Kocoum to take some men and observe. After one of the warriors is shot, Powhatan forbids his tribe from going near them (not knowing his daughter has already met one). Powhatan begins making plans to gather his allies, a call-to-arms to prepare for a war against the settlers. Later, Pocahontas, who has met a white man named [[John Smith]], asks her father if he would be willing to speak with a white settler should one wish to. Powhatan finally concedes that he would, but is certain that they would not want to.\n\nWhen Kocoum is killed, Powhatan orders that John Smith, who is believed to be the murderer, be killed at dawn. He then harshly scolds Pocahontas for disobeying him and leaving the village, and when she tries to explain that Smith was trying to help her, her father accuses her of foolishness and being a traitor and puts the blame of Kocoum's death on her, leaving his daughter in tear-inducing disgrace. Later that night, he and the warriors prepare for a war against the soldiers.\n\nAt dawn, Powhatan prepares to execute Smith but is stopped by Pocahontas, who reveals her love for the settler and tells him that he'll have to kill her if he kills John. Pocahontas refuses to stand aside and then scolds everyone for following a path of hatred and tells her father what would his path be if he choose to fight out of hatred. Powhatan looks to his warriors and the settlers preparing to attack each other, realizing that he will be responsible for the death of many more people, including his own, if he goes through with the execution. Seeing the wisdom in her daughter's words, he then spares Smith, and both sides lower their weapons. However, [[Governor Ratcliffe]], the leader of the settlers rejects the offer, attempts to kill Powhatan, as he believes the Indians to be hiding gold. John steps in the way, saving Powhatan's life. Powhatan is seen stooping to care for the injured Smith.\n\nLater, as Smith is preparing to return to [[England]] for medical treatment, Powhatan comes to see him off. Powhatan thanks John for saving him, giving Smith his own cape as a gift. Powhatan also tells Smith that he is welcome among the tribe.\n\n===''[[Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World]]''===\n[[John Rolfe]] is tasked with bringing the \"Indian Chief\" to England for negotiations to avoid war between the tribe and England. However, a misunderstanding leads Rolfe to believe that Pocahontas, rather than Powhatan is the chief. After learning his mistake, Powhatan is asked to accompany Rolfe back to England. Powhatan stubbornly refuses, and so Pocahontas is sent in his stead. Before Pocahontas leaves, Powhatan appoints a warrior named [[Uttamatomakkin]] as a bodyguard to Pocahontas during the voyage.\n\n==Trivia ==\n*According to history, this Pamunkey chief had many wives and children. All of his children were half-siblings and not two were, it is believed, full siblings. He would marry many at once in different stages of pregnancy. He would keep a wife until she bore him a child. When this was accomplished that wife and her child would be sent back to her own people. Later on, the child would be sent back to Powhatan's court and that woman would no longer be the chief's wife. She was then free to remarry.\n*He had a half-brother or younger brother named Opechancanough who succeeded him after his death in 1618. Opechancanough led an attack on Jamestown four years later because he felt his tribe was\u00a0threatened by the growing size of the settlement. [[John Rolfe]], who was then married to his third wife Jane Pierce, was possibly one of Opechancanough's victims.\u00a0\n*Ratcliffe's attempted murder of Powhatan was foreshadowed by Kekata, in which a wolf-shaped smoke representing the settlers tried to fly towards Powhatan, but it's blocked by him.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nPocahontas-disneyscreencaps.com-760.jpg\nIcerapocahontas0764.jpg\nPocahontas-disneyscreencaps.com-7241.jpg|\"Because of your foolishness, Kocoum is dead!\"\nPocahontas-disneyscreencaps.com-8170.jpg\nChief Powhatan Pin.jpg\nKaa&Mowgli-GoofysMenuMagic.png\nPoca-father2.jpg\nPocahontas-disneyscreencaps.com-1197.jpg\nPoca-father.jpg\nPocahontas Story 14.JPG\nPocahontas Story 11.JPG\nPocahontas-disneyscreencaps.com-1154.jpg\nPocahontas-disneyscreencaps.com-1398.jpg\nPowhatan chief 1418.jpg\nPowhatan chief 2662.jpg\nPocahontas-disneyscreencaps.com-6069.jpg|Powhatan with another tribal chieftain.\nPowhatansavagesong.jpg|Powhatan during the \"[[Savages]]\" song.\nDisney's Pocahontas - Savages - Powhatan - This Will Be the Morning.jpg|\"This will be the morning.\"\nJohn Smith 143.PNG\nPocahontas2-disneyscreencaps.com-1778.jpg\nPocahontas2-disneyscreencaps.com-1772.jpg\nPocahontas2-disneyscreencaps.com-1789.jpg\nJune17th.png|His [[Disneystrology]] page\nDP-DPRA-Lost-And-Found-Pocahontas-Reuniting-With-Chief-Powhatan.jpg\n\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Powhatan}}\n\n{{Pocahontas}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Pocahontas characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Historical characters]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Widows/Widowers]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Mentors]]\n[[Category:Native American characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Characters based on real people]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]"
