He appears as the\u00a0(temporary) main antagonist of [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[2006]] animated feature film, ''[[Brother Bear 2]]'', sequel to the [[Brother Bear|2003 film]].\u00a0He was voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]].\n\n==Role in the film==\nAtka is a very strong warrior [[Nita]] was supposed to marry. However, the [[The Great Spirits|Great Spirits]] interrupted the wedding ceremony, not wanting Nita to marry him because she was matched up to [[Kenai]].\n\nNita then went on a journey to Honkani Falls to burn an amulet that was given to her by Kenai so she can marry Atka. After her task was done, she returns to her village, but was hesitant in carrying out the wedding ceremony. After [[Koda]] sneaks into the village in order to get Nita's attention, Atka is one of the warriors chasing him down. In the film's climax, Atka nearly hurts Kenai, by pushing him off a cliff into shallow water below, and Nita yells at Atka for hurting Kenai as she runs to the bear's side, leaving Atka confused and remorseful over his actions. Later, as he reformed, Atka watches Nita turn into a bear by the Great Spirits of [[Sitka]] and [[Koda's mother]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nBrotherBearII Atka.jpg|Atka's artwork\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Atka in inuit language means \"Guardian Spirit\".\n\n{{Brother Bear}}\n[[Category:Hunters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Brother Bear characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric characters]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Native American characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Canadian characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
