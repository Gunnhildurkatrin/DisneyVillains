"[[File:Swinger.png|thumb|286x286px]]\n'''Swinger Kid/Girl''' is a student at [https://recess.wikia.com/wiki/Third_Street_School Third Street School] and one of the minor characters from ''[[Recess]]'', voiced by [[Francesca Marie Smith]].\n\n== Personality ==\nShe is always seen swinging as it is her favorite and only hobby. Her ultimate goal is to swing so high that she loops the swing set bar, but has never yet achieved it, despite [[Ashley Spinelli|Spinelli's]] belief to the contrary in \"[[Swing on Thru to the Other Side]]\". [[Menlo]] stated in \"[[Lawson and his Crew]]\" she is a possible possessor of even greater courage than [[Ashley Spinelli|Spinelli]] as she is not afraid of heights.\n\n== Appearance ==\nShe wears her trademark pilot's outfit with glasses and helmets. She often appears alongside Upside-Down Girl and other characters make frequent cameos with occasional speaking roles. In some episodes, Swinger Girl is referred to as Swinger Kid. In some episodes, Swinger Girl has either flown, fallen or been knocked off the swing several times, like in the very first episode. In the very first episode \"[[The Break In]]\", Swinger Girl swung off of her swing and tied a rope around a big pipe on the roof of the school allowing the kindergartners and other kids of the school to go across to get on to the roof of the building so they could all get in allowing [[T.J. Detweiler|T.J.]] to be freed from detention.\n\n==Trivia==\n*It is hard to determine which class she is in. In the episode \"[[Swing on Thru to the Other Side]]\", Vince said that the kids in Miss Furley's Class said she didn't show up for school today, hinting that she was in this class, but in \"[[The Great Can Drive]]\", she agreed to try and beat [[The Ashleys]].\n[[Category:Recess characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
