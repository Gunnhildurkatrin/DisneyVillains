[[2016]]}}</ref>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Rose Red seems to be based on the character from the Brother Grimm's story ''[[Wikipedia:Snow-White and Rose-Red|Snow-White and Rose-Red]]''. It should be noted that the Snow White in the original story was ''not'' the same Snow White from the popular ''[[Wikipedia:Snow White|Snow White]]'' story, nor was Rose Red related to the latter character. However, modern works of ''Snow White'' have referenced the relationship and, in some cases, combined the two tales.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Snow White}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Rose Red}}\n\n[[vi:H\u1ed3ng Nhung (nh\u00e2n v\u1eadt)]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Articles that need a picture]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Upcoming characters]]\n[[Category:Princesses]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:German characters]]\n[[Category:Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in remakes]]"
