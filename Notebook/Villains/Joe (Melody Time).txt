During the relationship, the two like to spend ice-skating together, but when he smirks at Jenny whom he thinks it is funny, she becomes separated from her in disgust. Later, Joe notices that Jenny is at the thin ice area just as she doesn't notice this warning to which the rabbit warning her smashes the ice in anger. However, when Joe rescues her, she even praised him for his heroism, because if it weren't for the rabbit's warning, Joe would lose Jenny.\n===Physical Appearance===\nHe is a slender man with fair skin, a pink nose and golden blond hair. He wears a white turtlenecked long-sleeved shirt, white mitt-like gloves, a primrose jacket with a black button and a collar, black pants, a black bobble hat with furry primrose pom-pom on the top, primrose socks and white boot-like skaters.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Melody Time]]''===\nJoe and Jenny spend time with each other during wintertime riding on a sleigh (along with a rabbit and bird couple following them). They later spend time ice-skating together, but when a near-tragedy ensues after he smirks at her falling as she separates from him in disgust (the male rabbit also does a similar action he did to the female rabbit), he heroically rescues her after witnessing one of the rabbits warning him about the thin ice. After rescuing, he and Jenny are reunited with each other riding on the sleigh as the woodland animals bid a farewell to them.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nLove-skate.png|Joe and Jenny ice-skating\nBloomers.png\nMush.png|Joe and Jenny kissing\nTumblr meu2iyABdI1r3jmn6o1 1280.png\nTumblr ngp1rrn8QK1r3jmn6o1 1280.png\nTumblr ngp1tc8lm31r3jmn6o1 1280.png\nTumblr_nh7l05mIQ41r3jmn6o1_1280.png|Joe rescuing Jenny\nJoe and Jenny.jpeg\n1948 MELODY TIME.png\ndiamond2.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Joe}}\n{{Melody Time}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Melody Time characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Wonderful World of Color]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Dreams! characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]"
