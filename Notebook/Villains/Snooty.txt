'''Experiment 277''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]]. He\u00a0is designed to mine and enrich Snootonium, a rare intergalactic energy source that becomes extremely unstable and dangerous once enriched. Luckily, there is none on Earth; however, Snootonium has a similar chemical composition to mucus, and so his programming draws him to individuals with large quantities. His one true place is as [[Victoria (Lilo & Stitch)|Victoria]]'s pet, clearing her sinuses.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nSnooty is a single-minded experiment dedicated to mining and enriching Snootonium. There is no Snootonium on Earth, but Snootonium has a similar chemical composition to mucus, so his programming draws him to individuals with large quantities of mucus, such as Victoria and [[Stitch]] (his body is 62.7% mucus). Unlike most experiments, Snooty is not inherently vile and is one of the more tame ones and will avoid harming others in his search. However, he will defend himself if he is provoked and is very persistent in fulfilling his primary function.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nSnooty is a vampire-esque experiment resembling a light-purple bat. He has a furless, triangle-shaped body and pointed ears. He has stumpy legs and dark purple wings each with two fingers and a thumb. He hardly has a neck, but in place is a wide fanged mouth.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nTo detect Snootonium, Snooty sees in an unidentified vision spectrum that allows him to detect the substance (similar to how snakes' infrared vision allows them to detect body heat). Snooty can also mine and enrich Snootonium and/or mucus by using his mouth/fangs; in the latter's case, he retrieves it via sucking it from a victim's nostrils in seconds.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment 277 was the 277th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to mine and enrich Snootonium, a rare element that has a similar chemical composition as Earth mucus. 277 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.\n\n277's pod eventually made its way onto a pickup truck's antenna. When the owner took the dirty pickup through a car wash, the pod got wet in the wash, activating 277. After spooking the pickup's driver, 277 left in search of Snootonium-like mucus.\n\nDrawn by her allergies, 277 frequently attacked [[Victoria (Lilo & Stitch)|Victoria]], who mistook him for a real vampire, but each time he was warded off by\u00a0[[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Stitch]]. They also prevented an impetuous\u00a0[[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] from capturing the experiment, despite Victoria's protests. When Lilo later looked up 277 on [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]]'s [[Jumba's Computer|computer]], she informed Victoria\u00a0that 277 was not an actual vampire and didn't need\u00a0to be slain or feared in any way.\n\nAt one point, 277, named Snooty by Lilo, spooked [[Officer Kahiko]], who offered to drive both girls home in his police car, prompting Victoria to comply. However, Snooty still attacked relentlessly in an attempt to get to her nasal mucus.\n\nDuring one of Snooty's assaults on Victoria, Stitch bravely challenged him. Snooty, upon detecting the visible mucus in Stitch's body, attacked the latter and sucked him dry. After Snooty put Stitch out of commission, Victoria vowed to slay the former if she had to do it herself without Lilo's help.\n\nWhen Lilo brought a weak Stitch [[Lilo's House|home]], Jumba explained that Stitch's body was 62.7% mucus that had been drained from him, and that its\u00a0chemical composition was similar to Snootonium. This also explained why Snooty kept going after Victoria.\n\nMeanwhile, Victoria was in a hardware store looking for items to slay Snooty with. She then noticed Gantu and decided to team up with him to slay the experiment. Using Gantu's [[Manta Shuttle|shuttle]], the two\u00a0tracked Snooty down to his cave in the [[Hawaii]]an mountains, where Gantu used Victoria as bait to successfully draw Snooty out.\n\nLilo soon arrived and was shocked to see Victoria with Gantu. Victoria tried to explain that Gantu was helping her slay Snooty, but Lilo managed to convince her of Gantu's treachery. Gantu blasted Snooty into a [[Net Cannon|net]], but the latter was then saved by Victoria and Lilo, who both fought Gantu for the experiment.\n\nAfter being freed, Snooty rested contentedly in Victoria's arms. When Snooty used his mucus-sucking power to clear Victoria's sinuses, the latter kept him as a pet.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nIn the film's opening, Snooty can be seen waving hello to [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], along with [[Babyfier]] and [[Amnesio]].\n\nLater, the first 624 experiments, including Snooty, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium\u00a0to be destroyed. However, Lilo, [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]], and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nSnooty participated in the following battle between the experiments and the\u00a0[[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]] by dodging Leroys' plasma projectiles.\n\nHowever, the Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Snooty is an obvious parody of\u00a0{{WikipediaLink|Count Dracula}} and vampires in general, except that vampires suck people's blood.\n*Snooty and [[Jam]]\u00a0are the only known experiments based on bats. Interestingly, they are both in the 2-series and purple. Additionally, they both share the same voice actor, [[Frank Welker]].\n*Victoria initially\u00a0mistook Snooty for a real vampire, and thus feared him.\n*Snooty is the first and only known experiment that Victoria caught.\n**He is also one of the six known experiments to be rehabilitated by someone other than Lilo and Stitch, the other five being [[Gigi]],\u00a0[[Elastico]], [[Yaarp]], [[Spike (Lilo & Stitch)|Spike]], and [[Frenchfry]].\n*Snooty's [[Experiment Pods|pod]]\u00a0color is red. However, a white pod labeled 277 appeared in \"[[Mrs. Hasagawa's Cats]]\".\n*The [[Experiment Pod Container]] describes Snooty as:\u00a0\"Experiment 277. Primary function: Mine and enrich Snootonium.\"\n**He is the only known experiment whose above primary function is not capable of being utilized on Earth, as Snootonium is a substance not found on Earth.\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Bats]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Vampires]]"
