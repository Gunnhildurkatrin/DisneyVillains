The Rescue Rangers interrogate the wolves in the zoo, where Harry was fast asleep. However, Harry's mate, [[Harriet]], informs the Rescue Rangers that she has noticed her husband acting a little odd.\n\nDuring the Rescue Rangers stakeout in the zoo, the Rangers watch as Harry, turn into a human. The Rangers follow him on his wild adventures through the city, where Harry's revolting table manners and not having the means to pay for his meal cause the wolf-man to get kicked out of a restaurant. Harry later steals a car and goes a joy ride, meanwhile [[Officer Kirby and Officer Muldoon]] chase the wolf thief from another robbery. During a chase, Harry turns back into a wolf, and the wolf burglar turns into [[Professor Norton Nimnul]]. Kirby and Muldoon capture Harry, mistaking him for the thief. [[Chip and Dale]] trail after Nimnul, and learn that he created a device, the Metamorphisizer, which switches the physical forms of two animals. Nimnul uses this to exchange physical forms with Harry the wolf so he can carry out his robberies.\n\nThe other Rangers help Harry escape the pound. They all meet up and through the switching of metamorphisizers among animals in the zoo, Nimnul and the many zoo animals become mixed-up species. The Rangers manage to unscramble all the animals and Nimnul is taken into custody.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"Small\" captionalign=\"center\">\nHarry-A Wolf in Cheap Clothing01.png\nHarriet-A Wolf in Cheap Clothing10.png\nHarriet-A Wolf in Cheap Clothing11.png\nHarry-A Wolf in Cheap Clothing03.png\nHarry-A Wolf in Cheap Clothing05.png\nHarry-A Wolf in Cheap Clothing07.png\nHarry-A Wolf in Cheap Clothing10.png\nHarry-A Wolf in Cheap Clothing12.png\nHarry-A Wolf in Cheap Clothing27.png\nHarry-A Wolf in Cheap Clothing36.png\nHarry-A Wolf in Cheap Clothing38.png\nHarry-A Wolf in Cheap Clothing41.png\nHarry-A Wolf in Cheap Clothing49.png\nHarry-A Wolf in Cheap Clothing52.png\nHarry-A Wolf in Cheap Clothing53.png\nHarry-A Wolf in Cheap Clothing55.png\nHarry-A Wolf in Cheap Clothing62.png\nHarry-A Wolf in Cheap Clothing71.png\nHarry-A Wolf in Cheap Clothing74.png\nHarry-A Wolf in Cheap Clothing75.png\nHarry-A Wolf in Cheap Clothing81.png\nHarry-A Wolf in Cheap Clothing86.png\nHarry-A Wolf in Cheap Clothing87.png\nHarry-A Wolf in Cheap Clothing88.png\nHarry-A Wolf in Cheap Clothing108.png\nHarry-A Wolf in Cheap Clothing113.png\nHarry-A Wolf in Cheap Clothing114.png\nNimnul -A Wolf in Cheap Clothing161.png\nNimnul -A Wolf in Cheap Clothing177.png\nHarry-A Wolf in Cheap Clothing117.png\nHarry-A Wolf in Cheap Clothing118.png\nTic-toc -A Wolf in Cheap Clothing08.png\nHarry-A Wolf in Cheap Clothing122.png\nHarry-A Wolf in Cheap Clothing123.png\nHarry-A Wolf in Cheap Clothing124.png\nHarry-A Wolf in Cheap Clothing125.png\nHarry-A Wolf in Cheap Clothing126.png\nHarry-A Wolf in Cheap Clothing128.png\nHarry-A Wolf in Cheap Clothing129.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Rescue Rangers}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Harry}}\n[[Category:Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Wolves]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Zoo Animals]]"
