They live in a Sprite Village in [[New Jersey]] woods.\n\n==History==\nTwo Sprites were possibly killed or captured by [[the Jersey Devil]] in the beginning of \"[[The Long Weekend]]\". A Male Sprite tells [[Jake Long|Jake]], [[Trixie Carter|Trixie]], and [[Arthur \"Spud\" P. Spudinski|Spud]] to come with him to show the Sprite village and tell them about the Great Evil will arrive. An Elder Sprite says that the Stars tell the Sprites that in\u00a0100 years the Evil will arrive and attack the Sprites for seven consecutive nights. The second Elder Sprite says the Evil is the Jersey Devil who will raid the supplies and pillage their food stores leaving them to starve during the Winter Season. After the Jersey Devil falls\u00a0over a cliff and dies, the Sprites make a hero statue\u00a0of Jake's Dad,\u00a0saying\u00a0that he\u00a0is their greatest hero after the Jersey Devil was killed. The Sprites appeared in \"[[The Long Weekend]]\" and \"[[The Hunted]]\".\n\n{{American Dragon: Jake Long}}\n[[Category:American Dragon: Jake Long characters]]\n[[Category:Fairies]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
