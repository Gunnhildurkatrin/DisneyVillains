He appeared to be slightly vain as well in Raya's description. \n\n== Role in the film ==\nDang Hai and a few of his people attend the truce meeting of their divided lands, as [[Chief Benja]] of the [[Heart (Raya and the Last Dragon)|Heart land]] wishes for all of them to become [[Kumandra]] again. After the gem was broken to pieces, he took one and kept it at Talon.\n\nWhen Raya reaches his house in Talon, it is revealed he has been turned to stone by the [[Druun]], while [[Dang Hu]] became the new chief in his place. He is later revived along with the rest of the Druun's victims when the gem is placed back together.\n\n{{Template:Stub}}\n{{Raya and the Last Dragon}}\n[[Category:Raya and the Last Dragon characters]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Those brought back to life]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]"
