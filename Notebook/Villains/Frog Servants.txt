When she asks some of them if they stole her tarts, they deny. As she looks at the last one, she gazes at him and asks him if he stole her tarts to which he denies. The Red Queen then touches a splotch of Squimberry juice, worried that he was so hungry as the Queen sends her guards to execute him. Later after the [[Tarrant Hightopp|Mad Hatter]] escapes from execution with help from [[Chessur]], the frog servants are seen celebrating their freedom in a plan to fight against the Red Queen.\n\n==Trivia==\n*They are based on the [http://aliceinwonderland.fandom.com/wiki/Frog-Footman Frog Footman] character from the Lewis Caroll works. However, unlike in the books, there are multiple Frog Footmen working for the Red Queen in the film.\n**Coincidentally, the Frog Footman was not featured in the [[1951]] [[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Disney film]], though a drum frog with a loose green head and a cymbal frog with eyes on top of its cymbals and blue legs are briefly seen when [[Alice]] explores [[Tulgey Wood]].\n\n{{Alice in Wonderland}}\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Frogs]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Servants]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Males]]"
