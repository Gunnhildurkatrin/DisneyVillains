She is [[Jake Long|Jake]], [[Arthur Spudinski|Spud]], and [[Trixie Carter|Trixie]]'s Home Economics teacher. She appears to be a [[wikipedia:Pacifist|pacifist]], but is later revealed to be the Korean Dragon, having come to be [[Haley Long|Haley's]] dragon teacher.\n\n==History==\n\nShe is actually the Korean dragon, and takes up the duty of training Jake's little sister [[Haley Long|Haley]] as her dragon master. Her training method for Hayley is much different from [[Luong Lao Shi|Lao Shi]]'s method of training Jake, using a softer approach while giving lessons on trust and peace as opposed to Lao Shi having Jake clean a giants teeth and to trust no one<ref>[[Family Business (American Dragon: Jake Long)|Family Business]]</ref>. One thing she doesn't like is Jake pulling bad pranks on Haley (no matter how much she deserves it). Jake asked for her help when a [[Pooka Pooka|Pooka]] was controlling Haley and other children<ref>[[Haley Gone Wild]]</ref>. She tells Jake that he is destined for great things and gives him extra credit<ref>[[Half Baked]]</ref>. She is usually called Mrs. Park. She is present when [[The Huntsclan|the Huntsclan]] is destroyed by [[Rose]] and Jake made his wish to save her life before he destroyed all the skulls. Sun Park passes by, but she doesn't see Brad about to hurt Jake, but Brad was beaten by [[Evil Jake|Jake's negative doppelganger]]<ref name=\"gang\">[[The Doppelganger Gang]]</ref>.\n\nShe fights [[Councilor Chang|Chang]] and rescues Jake<ref name=\"being\">[[Being Human]]</ref>. She fights in the final battle with [[the Dark Dragon]], Chang, and [[Bananas B.]] She helps Haley defeat Chang by tossing a sphinx-hair net on her that had been used to contain Gramps. She was told to destroy [[the Dragon Council]] by the Dark Dragon but she has huge long ears, while the other dragons turn into different animals, before the final battle is about to begin. She escapes with the other dragons, but Rose is still fighting the Dark Dragon. After the Dark Dragon is imprisoned in another dimension, Sun is cheering for Jake and Rose with the other heroes after The Dark Dragon is gone<ref>[[The Hong Kong Longs]]</ref>.\n\n==Episode Appearances==\n*\"[[Half Baked|Half-Baked]]\" (first appearance)\n*\"[[Family Business (American Dragon: Jake Long)|Family Business]]\"\n*\"[[Haley Gone Wild]]\"\n*\"[[The Doppelganger Gang]]\" (cameo)\n*\"[[Homecoming]]\"\n*\"[[Game On]]\"\n*\"[[Being Human]]\"\n*\"[[The Hong Kong Longs]]\" (final appearance)\n\n==Trivia==\n*According to executive producers Eddie Guzelian and Matt NeGrate, Sun was originally supposed to have a fight on top of a volcano with Rose in<ref>[[Homecoming]]</ref>, which would have resulted in her death at Rose's hands, however the scene was cut for being too dark.\n*Sun Park is seen shortly when she gives Jake an extra credit assignment<ref name=\"bake\">[[Half Baked]]</ref>.\n*Sun Park is called Mrs. Park in the yearbook and she is one of the teachers in the yearbook<ref name=\"being\">[[Being Human]]</ref>.\n*Sun Park is angry at Haley, because Haley was complaining to her about the annoying troll woman that lost the wedding ring down the drain and Haley refused to get it, but sadly she had to.\n*Sun uses her meditation training to calm mind controlled people down when they are controlled by the Pooka.\n*She doesn't want Lao Shi to be to angry at Jake when he messes up.\n*Sun Park makes a cameo appearance in one episode<ref name=\"gang\">[[The Doppelganger Gang]]</ref>, but she doesn't speak.\n*There are only two episodes in which Sun Park does not turn into a dragon<ref name=\"bake\">[[Half Baked]]</ref><ref name=\"gang\">[[The Doppelganger Gang]]</ref>.\n*Sun Park never appeared in Season 1.\n*In dragon forms, Chang is taller than Sun, but in human forms, Sun is taller than Chang.\n*She somehow knows who Chang is, but she doesn't see Chang in Season 1.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{American Dragon: Jake Long}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Park, Sun}}\n[[Category:American Dragon: Jake Long characters]]\n[[Category:Asian characters]]\n[[Category:Dragons]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Schoolteachers]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Martial Artists]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
