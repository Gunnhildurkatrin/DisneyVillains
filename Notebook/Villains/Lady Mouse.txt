This young lady is in terrible trouble and only Basil seems fit to the challenge. Her presence was the perfect diversion of Dawson nearly making his exit to seek new lodgings and Basil chose this moment to recruit the doctor as his new business partner. As she dabs her tearful eyes with a dainty handkerchief, the two shake hands and it is onward to their next adventure.\n\n==Trivia==\n* While unnamed in the film, it is possible that she is based on Mademoiselle Relda, a supporting character from the ''Basil of Baker Street'' books and possible love interest of Basil.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\ngreat-mouse-detective-disneyscreencaps.com-8327.jpg\ngreat-mouse-detective-disneyscreencaps.com-8328.jpg\nLady Mouse 1.png\nLady Mouse.png\ngreat-mouse-detective-disneyscreencaps.com-8398.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Great Mouse Detective}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mouse, Lady}}\n[[Category:The Great Mouse Detective characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Mice]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
