'''Experiment 509''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]]. He\u00a0is designed to sprout into an uncontrollable forest of destruction. His one true place is\u00a0atop the pineapple water tower.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nSprout is wild and tends to be aggressive, often trying to bite people when he was still confined in a flower pot. After he rooted into the ground and grew to enormous proportions, he became very dangerous, spreading his vines like weeds to attack victims.\u00a0However, he apparently calmed down after being uprooted and contained. He also seems to like [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]].\n\n===Physical appearance===\nSprout is a plant-like experiment with a purple head shaped like a {{WikipediaLink|Venus flytrap}}, giving him a lizard-like face and sharp teeth. He has dark blue pupil-less eyes, three leaves surrounding his head like a frill, and a single antenna on his head. His body is leaf-like, with a thick green stem extending to his head and containing eight tentacle-like vines.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nSprout can grow from a small experiment to an immense monstrosity at a rapid rate. Using his burrowing capabilities, Sprout can initiate his growth once he roots into the ground, allowing him to sprout a destructive forest of vicious duplicates, and sends out tendrils that can grow new heads and act like weeds, all with replicas of Sprout's head.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment 509 was the 509th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to spawn into an uncontrollable killer forest. 509 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\n509's pod eventually made its way into a\u00a0post office, where [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]]\u00a0found it on the floor while she was mailing a letter to her pen pal Henry. She then took the pod\u00a0[[Lilo's House|home]] to [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]]\u00a0who described 509's powers, but Jumba, unwilling to risk activating 509 due to the destruction the latter would cause, locked the pod away.\n\nHowever, the following night, Lilo and [[Stitch]]\u00a0stealthily stole 509's pod from Jumba's desk drawer.\u00a0Lilo then activated the experiment, named him Sprout, transplanted him, and fed him super-fertilizer.\n\nThe next day, Lilo took a rapidly-growing Sprout to an outdoor orchid competition. When [[Mertle Edmonds|Mertle]] approached Sprout and noticed he was not an orchid, Sprout lashed out at her, causing Mertle to accidentally break his pot open.\n\nSprout then rooted into the ground and grew into a massive forest of killer plants, which took over the [[Kokaua Town]] fair, causing widespread panic and Stitch to lose the rodeo to [[Zach Mackillin|a five-time champion cowboy]]. Jumba and [[Nani Pelekai|Nani]] learn of the situation and are angry with Lilo for activating Sprout against Jumba's wishes. \n\nEventually, Stitch managed to lasso the original Sprout, uproot him, and drag him into a [[Pineapple Water Tower|pineapple-shaped water tower]] slated for demolition, trapping the latter and causing the forest to die off without the original Sprout. Lilo\u00a0was unsure if this was\u00a0truly Sprout's one true place, but apparently it was the best\u00a0she and Stitch could do on such short notice.\n\nSprout was seen on a computer screen in \"[[Ace (episode)|Ace]]\", posing as an evil creation of Jumba's as\u00a0part of a hoax to fool [[Mortlegax]], the head of E.G.O. industries.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nThe first 624 experiments, including Sprout, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]], and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nSprout participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]].\n\nThe Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.\u00a0Sprout joins them for the song by playing the drums.\n\n===''[[Stitch!]]''===\nSprout was mentioned twice in the ''Stitch!'' anime. In \"Shogun\", it is shown that Sprout was dehydrated back into an experiment pod and locked in [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]]'s vault.\n\nThough Sprout did not officially appear in the exclusive episode's English dub, his [[Sproutling|son]] did. It is revealed that Sprout can produce seed pods and launch them into space, where they cling to asteroids. One of these pods landed on the\u00a0[[Izayoi Island|island]] and grew into a \"Sproutling\" (509-A) that carried out Sprout's original programming before being neutralized.\n\nIn \"Sprout 2.0\", [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]] reveals that he has enhanced another one of Sprout's seedlings with the DNA of [[627|Experiment 627]], disguised it as a plant, and hid it on a deserted island in an attempt to capture [[Stitch]]. [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] and [[Reuben]] disguise themselves and convince Stitch and the gang to go find a flower that grants wishes, but is truly the seedling. Shortly after arriving on the island, the gang finds and almost instantly captures the seedling. However, when the seedling escapes, 627's DNA causes him to become unstoppable. Luckily, this also gave the seedling 627's only weakness: laughter.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Sprout was first revealed in a DVD bonus feature of ''[[Stitch! The Movie]]'' in the experiment gallery.\n*Sprout is an obvious parody of [[w:c:villains:Audrey II|Audrey II]] from ''{{WikipediaLink|Little Shop of Horrors (film)|Little Shop of Horrors}}''.\n*Sprout bears a great resemblance to most real-life {{WikipediaLink|Venus flytrap|Venus flytraps}}.\n*Sprout's [[Experiment Pods|pod]]\u00a0color is blue.\n*Sprout's holographic silhouette appeared in both \"[[Amnesio (episode)|Amnesio]]\" and \"[[Fibber (episode)|Fibber]]\".\n**Sprout is shown to have two different graphic designs on [[Jumba's Computer|Jumba's computer]].\n*In the battle between the [[Leroy]] [[Leroy Clones|army]] and the experiments\u00a0at the end of\u00a0''[[Leroy & Stitch]]'', Sprout did not grow\u00a0into an uncontrollable forest of destruction\u00a0like\u00a0he did\u00a0in [[Sprout (episode)|his debut]].\n*In the English dub of ''[[Stitch!]]'', Sprout is said to produce seeds called [[Sproutling]]s\u00a0(a.k.a. Experiment 509-A) that carry out the same primary function as their father.\n*According to [[Jess Winfield]], Sprout was originally going to be named \"Weedy\" at one point.<ref name=\"WinfieldTVTome\">{{cite web|title=L&S Says Mahalo|url=http://lasfansite.atspace.me/stuff/history/tvtome/page03.html|website={{WikipediaLink|TV.com|TV Tome}}|via=Yet Another Lilo & Stitch Fansite|accessdate=May 27, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319134719/http://lasfansite.atspace.me/stuff/history/tvtome/page03.html|dead-url=no|archivedate=March 19, 2016|date=December 14, 2004}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Plants]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
