He easily befriends them all, but is most fond of [[Cubbi Gummi|Cubbi]], as he relates to the youngster after having been the youngest among his peers as well. Realizing the possibility of Cubbi becoming to last Gummi of Gummi Glen, Chummi offers to take all the Gummi Glen Gummies with him to [[New Gumbria]], aboard his airship.\n\nHis generous offer is initially accepted. Eventually however, the Gummies realized that they do not want to abandon their caretaker duties and just leave their ancestral home behind. Only Cubbi chooses to make the journey, hoping to finally get the chance to be trained as a Gummi knight upon arrival across the ocean.\n\nDuring the journey, Chummi's airship is taken down over [[Drekmore Castle]] by [[Duke Igthorn]] and his [[Ogres]], who seek to use it as a war machine against [[Dunwyn Castle]].\n\nThankfully, with help from the Gummies of Gummi Glen, Chummi gets his airship back and together they thwart Igthorn's scheme. By this time, Cubbi has decided against leaving, and returns home. Chummi continues his journey across the ocean, promising to inform the Great Gummies about the existence of the Gummies of Gummi Glen.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=180 spacing=small position=center captionalign=center>\nScreen Shot 2016-02-06 at 11.05.33 PM.png\nScreen Shot 2016-02-06 at 11.05.35 PM.png\nScreen Shot 2016-02-06 at 11.05.41 PM.png\nAdventuresOfTheGummiBears-UpUpAndAway-CubbiAndChummi.png\nChummi Gummi 2.jpg\nRufftuffburlysailorz.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Adventures of the Gummi Bears}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gummi, Chummi}}\n[[Category:Adventures of the Gummi Bears characters]]\n[[Category:Bears]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Gummi bears]]"
