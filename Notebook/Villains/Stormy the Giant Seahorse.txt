He appears in ''[[The Little Mermaid (TV series)|The Little Mermaid]]'' television series.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[The Little Mermaid (TV series)|The Little Mermaid: The Series]]''===\n[[Ariel]] finds him at the seahorse corral one day while she, [[Flounder]] and [[Sebastian]] are out for a swim. That night at dinner, Ariel asks [[King Triton]] to let her ride Stormy, but he refuses. King Triton reminds Ariel of the time she hid [[Spot the Killer Whale|Spot]] in her room and brought a giant squid home for dinner. King Triton tells Ariel not to go near Stormy. Ariel disobeys him, and sees Stormy, anyway. King Triton catches her, and plans to sell Stormy to a seahorse trader to keep Ariel safe. Ariel thinks she can break Stormy on her own, and finds out that she was wrong. Ariel takes Stormy out the next night, and gets lost in the wilderness. King Triton finds out what Ariel has done, and rides off on his own white stallion, with Sebastian, Flounder and the Seahorse Trainer in tow. Elsewhere, Ariel finds out that Stormy wants to go to the Wilderness, a part of the ocean that even she feels isn't safe. Two octopus wild seahorse wranglers attempt to catch Stormy, but are somewhat unsuccessful. As the wild seahorse wranglers chase them, Ariel is knocked out after hitting her head while she rides Stormy. King Triton has a talk with Ariel, and they reach an understanding. As soon as Ariel's well enough, they set Stormy free. King Triton gives Ariel a calmer seahorse named Seabiscuit. They happily race home, and Stormy sadly watches them go. Stormy then returns home to the wild.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Though he is voiced by [[Jim Cummings]], he rarely speaks.\n\n{{The Little Mermaid}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Marine Animals]]\n[[Category:The Little Mermaid characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Seahorses]]\n[[Category:Giants]]"
