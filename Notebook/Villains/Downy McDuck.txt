The story details how Scrooge's young and unmarried parents have moved to the Klondike, where they decide to get married and have their first son, Scrooge. In the original version of this story, Scrooge's mother was called '''Oretta Paporetta '''(\"oro\" meaning \"gold\" in Italian). The story is the eleventh chapter of the Italian series\u00a0''Storia e gloria della dinastia dei paperi'', which shows the history of the McDucks from the ancient Egyptians to the present date.\n\nShe was a minor recurring character in ''[[The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck]]'' (''[[Uncle Scrooge]]''\u00a0#285-296). In these stories, she and her family live a life of poverty in\u00a0[[Scotland]] during Scrooge's childhood. Downy was also featured on\u00a0[[Don Rosa]]'s\u00a0''Donald Duck Family Tree''\u00a0(''[[Walt Disney's Comics and Stories]]''\u00a0#600).\n\nDowny reappeared in Uncle Scrooge's flashbacks in the Christmas-themed comics ''[https://inducks.org/story.php?c=D+2012-058 Donald's Homemade Christmas]''\u00a0and ''[https://inducks.org/story.php?c=I+TL+3239-1 Scrooge's Christmas Carol]'', alongside Hortense, Matilda and Fergus.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[DuckTales]]''===\n[[File:McMama.png|thumb|left|220px|McMama in \"Once Upon a Dime\".]]\nIn the episode \"[[The Curse of Castle McDuck]]\", Scrooge mentioned his mother, saying that she always told him the story of the hound of castle McDuck. Even though Scrooge claims that he does not believe the story, and that his mother probably made it up so that Scrooge would keep away from the castle, he is still frightened and hesitant to enter the castle grounds. Scrooge also returns to cottage McDuck, where he and his parents used to live. According to this episode, Scrooge's parents were poor farmers.\n\nScrooge's parents made their animated debut in the Season 1 episode\u00a0\"[[Once Upon a Dime]]\", in which Scrooge refers to Downy as '''McMama'''. She, Scrooge and Scrooge's father can be seen living in cottage McDuck, as it previously appeared in the series.\n\n[[Beagle Boys|Backwoods Beagle]] briefly mentioned Scrooge's mother in the season three episode \"[[Ducky Mountain High]]\". When he is trying to come up with a reason for Scrooge to leave the room, he says: \"Your mother is sick!\".\n\n===''[[DuckTales (2017 series)|DuckTales 2017]]''===\nIn the episode \"[[The Secret(s) of Castle McDuck!]]\", Downy greets the kids with open arms. Both were slightly tricked into believing Launchpad was Donald by Scrooge. They only saw \"resemblance\" when Launchpad mimics Donald's temper. \n\n==Trivia==\n*Both Donald Duck's paternal grandmother ([[Grandma Duck]]) and his maternal grandmother (Downy) were voiced by June Foray.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nEdithodrake.JPG\nhr (73467).png|Scrooge briefly mentoins his mother.\nImg103.jpg\nMV5BMjM1OTg1NTA5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzAzMzg0MjE@.
