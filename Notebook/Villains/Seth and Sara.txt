Like her brother, she is immune to bullets and can stop such weapons in their tracks with her telekinesis.\n\nSeth has the ability to change his own molecular structure, enabling him to pass through solid matter. He is quite durable and has incredibly high agility, reflexes and near-invulnerability to most damage. He is also unhurt by bullets.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Race to Witch Mountain]]''===\nSeth and Sara lived on a dying\u00a0world, but their parents who\u00a0 are scientists, sought a way to save their planet without invasion but were arrested before completing their experiment.
