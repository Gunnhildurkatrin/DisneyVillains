However, like most of the residents of Halloween Town, he loves to sing and may just be a monster doing his job rather than the actual Devil. He also finds the Pox disease to be delightful.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]''===\nThe Devil joined in with the citizens of the Halloween Town while they sing \"[[This is Halloween]]\" song.
