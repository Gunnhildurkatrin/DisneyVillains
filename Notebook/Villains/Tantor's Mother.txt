Tantor then spots [[Tarzan (character)|Tarzan]] and takes him for a piranha, and tells her about this, and she doesn't believe him until Tarzan grabs one of the bull elephant's tails, causing a stampede, almost killing a family member of the apes in the process and leading [[Kerchak]] to scold Tarzan for nearly killing someone and himself. She is seen for the last time during the song \"[[Son of Man]]\".\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Tarzan}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Tarzan characters]]\n[[Category:Elephants]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:African characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
