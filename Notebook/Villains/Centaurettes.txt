They were beautiful female horse-like girls (centaurettes) of different colors who were in love with the male horse-like [[Centaurs (Fantasia)|centaurs]].\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Fantasia]]''===\nThe centaurettes are first seen by the river and a waterfall. Some of them were swimming in the river and splashing each other for fun. The ones on dry land were assisted by the small [[Cherubs|cherubs]] with their hair and makeup. The cherubs see the centaurs and help the centaurettes look their best to attract the attention of the centaurs. Each centaurette was able to find a centaur to mate with, and are shown doing various fun activities with their new beaus.\n\nThe centaurettes and centaurs attend the Wine Festival honoring [[Bacchus (Fantasia)|Bacchus]] and help make the wine. Once Bacchus arrives, the centaurettes dance with him and the centaurs. One centaurette flirts with him and he pursues her. The others tease him as well and laugh when Bacchus accidentally kisses [[Jacchus]], his pet donkey. When Zeus arrives to torment them, they all take shelter under trees and in a cave. One centaurette saves a little [[Unicorns|unicorn]] that's trapped on a rock in the river before joining the others. Once Zeus departs, they watch the sunset before going to sleep.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Despite most myths depicting centaurs as a dominantly male race, the centaurettes have mythological ties: there were myths that identified female centaurs as the {{WikipediaLink|Centaurides}}, the rare class of female centaurs in Greek mythology.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nTumblr n7lshdj66z1r3jmn6o1 1280.png\nfantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-8635.jpg\nfantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-8640.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-5826-1-.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-5860-1-.jpg|A white centaurette\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-5867-1-.jpg|Two cupids brush a yellow centaurette's hair\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-5878-1-.jpg|A pink centaurette relaxes while three cupids braid her tail\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-5884-1-.jpg|A centaurette filing her nails with a cattail\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-5902-1-.jpg|A centaurette having her face powdered by a cupid\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-5909-1-.jpg|A black-haired centaurette getting lipstick put on\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-5914-1-.jpg|The centaurette smiles at her reflection\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-5979-1-.jpg|A centaurette with a lily pad hat\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-6002-1-.jpg|A centaurette with a tree bark hat\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-6026-1-.jpg|A centaurette wearing two doves as a hat\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-6028-1-.jpg|The centaurettes look at the centaurs\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-6072-1-.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-6078-1-.jpg|A centaurette with ringlets modeling for the centaurs\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-6089-1-.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-6139-1-.jpg|A blue centaurette\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-6147-1-.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-6165-1-.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-6174-1-.jpg\nTumblr lyvy4tfPVx1r3jmn6o1 1280.png\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-6193-1-.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-6203-1-.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-9089.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-9101.jpg\nimageofcentaurette.jpg|A centaurette swinging on a swing\nCentaurettesphoto.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-9660.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-9721.jpg\nTumblr n3u8kjFASp1rxt9glo6 1280.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-9804.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-9927.jpg|One centaurette rescues a unicorn\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-10511.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-10564.jpg\nTumblr n3gntrpO2y1r18ivno1 1280.jpg\nBlog Nubian centaurette.jpg\nBlog Nubian centaurette 2.jpg\nBlog model department centaur centaurette maquette.jpg\nBlog click mag Nubian.JPG\nBlog reluctant dragon screen grab.jpg\nHouseofmouseguests2.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Fantasia}}\n[[fr:Centaurettes]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]\n[[Category:Greek Mythology]]\n[[Category:Hybrids]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Centaurs]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Fantasia characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Horses]]"
