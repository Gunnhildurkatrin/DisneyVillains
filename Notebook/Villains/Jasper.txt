However, his infatuation also makes him easily distracted as he will mindlessly go after anything shiny. He also likes to \"Go, Go, Go!\"\n\n==Role in the series==\nIn his debut appearance, after seeing\u00a0[[Sofia the First (character)|Sofia]]'s\u00a0[[Amulet of Avalor]], Jasper followed her and stole it after she reluctantly took it off. He then began stealing other shiny objects around the castle, including the Queen's new tiara, until he was spotted by Sofia's animal friends but escaped from them.\n\nJasper nearly fell into a trap by\u00a0[[Cedric the Sorcerer]]\u00a0to obtain the amulet by baiting him with a jewel\u00a0but due to a delay in Cedric's spell casting, Jasper got away with the jewel. Cedric chased after him using a flying contraption until he crashed into the ballroom where Sofia and the guests were. Sofia realized that Jasper was the thief and discovered him under the table hoarding the things he stole and gave back her necklace. Jasper was taken back to the jewel room, where the guards made sure to keep a close eye on him from now on.\n\nAt the time of \"[[Minimus is Missing]],\" Jasper had gotten much bigger and more mature. When [[Minimus]] and the other flying horses went missing, Jasper and his parents accompanied Sofia, James, and Amber in their search for them. Jasper showed that he gets excited easily and flies head-on into any situation without thinking it through. After saving all the flying horses from [[Wendell Fidget|Wendell]], he was very happy and wanted to go on another adventure. His parents commented that they would never be able to get him back in the jewel room after this.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nBaby Griffin 2.jpg\nBaby Griffin 3.jpg\nClover& Baby Griff.jpg\nSofia Baby Griff.png\nSofia Baby Griff02.jpg\nBabyGriff &amp;Sofia.png\nBaby Griff James &amp;Amber02.png\nSofia the first S03E02 (31).jpg\nSofia the first S03E02 (28).jpg\nSofia the first S03E02 (33).jpg\nSofia the first S03E02 (25).jpg|Jasper snaps the neck of the lute.\nSofia the first S03E02 (17).jpg\nbaby griffin plush.jpg|[[Disney Store]] Jasper Plush\nSofia the First Figures.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Jasper was originally referred as the \"Baby Griffin\" until his name was revealed in \"[[Minimus is Missing]]\".\n*Like his parents, he was named after gemstones, in Jasper's case he was named after jasper, a type of orange colored quartz.\n\n{{Sofia the First}}\n[[Category:Sofia the First characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Infants]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Griffins]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]"
