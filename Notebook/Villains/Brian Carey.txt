She wants his help to give Susan a taste of her own medicine.\n\nTogether with Sharon in disguise, Brian goes to a restaurant, where Susan is having a date with Bill as \"Sharon\". Brian being there with a mysterious woman convinces Susan that he is cheating on her, causing her to break character and confront him.\n\nBrian later attends Sharon and Bill's wedding together with Susan. They divorced some time prior to her meeting and marrying [[Jeffrey Wyatt]].\n\n==Trivia==\n*In ''[[The Parent Trap II]]'' ([[1986]]), Susan mentions that she has been married to Brian for 12 years. This would place their wedding in [[1974]]. However, in ''[[The Parent Trap III]]'' ([[1989]]), she gives her former stepchildren's (Brian's kids) current ages as 14 and 16. This would place their births in [[1973]] and [[1975]].\n\n\n{{The Parent Trap}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Carey, Brian}}\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Uncles]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]\n[[Category:The Parent Trap characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]"
