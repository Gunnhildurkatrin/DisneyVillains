She is a peach-colored penguin who has purple hair with pink tufts, green headphones, a pink and yellow scarf, a pair of pink and yellow wristbands, black eyelashes, along with black and white shoes.\n\nShe seems to be very polite. She is a more modern penguin proved by her saying \"lol\" and \"EPIC FAIL!\". She did not have any body items until her redesign in 2013, however. She first appeared in the [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Club_Penguin_Times Club Penguin Times] when there was a tour about the [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Night_Club Night Club]. Her favorite phrase is, \"''It's time to dance!''\". She likes to call herself the \"Dance Machine\". Like [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Rockhopper Rockhopper], the [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Penguin_Band Penguin Band], [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Gary Gary], [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Rookie Rookie], and [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Aunt_Arctic Aunt Arctic], she waddles around [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Club_Penguin_Island Club Penguin Island] giving out a free [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Background background]. Cadence is part of the team that made the [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Dance-A-Thon Dance-A-Thon] party. She made a brand new game called [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Dance_Contest Dance Contest]. She is the only [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Penguin penguin] that can equip two hand items: her boom box and her wristbands. Cadence is one of the only famous female [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Penguin penguins] on [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Club_Penguin Club Penguin] other than [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Aunt_Arctic Aunt Arctic]. She seems to like sugar, since she continuously screams \"CHOCOLATE!\" or \"ICE CREAM\" OR \"SUGAR RUSH!\" She loves to dance with penguins.\n\n[http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Penguin Penguins] using a [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Cheating cheating] device such as WPE Pro can get her hair, wristbands, scarf and shoes, but this is cheating, which is against the rules and will most likely result in a ban.\n\nShe shows up in the [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Dance_Contest Dance Contest] game. When she asks what difficulty the player wants, they can click on her to get to Expert Mode, which is really hard. The player would have to be pretty good at Dance Contest to do well on the expert level.\n\nCadence has a [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Purple_Puffle Purple Puffle] named [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Lolz Lolz]<ref>https://twitter.com/mlewey/statuses/190205728923987969</ref> first seen at the [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Puffle_Party_2011 Puffle Party 2011].\n\n==Appearances==\n*[http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Dance-A-Thon Dance-A-Thon]\n*[http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Penguin_Play_Awards_2009 Penguin Play Awards 2009]\n*[http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Music_Jam_2009 Music Jam 2009]\n*[http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Penguin_Play_Awards_2010 Penguin Play Awards 2010]\n*[http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Music_Jam_2010 Music Jam 2010]\n*[http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Puffle_Party_2011 Puffle Party 2011]\n*[http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Music_Jam_2011 Music Jam 2011]\n*[http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Fashion_Show Fashion Show]\n*[http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Make_Your_Mark%3A_Ultimate_Jam Make Your Mark: Ultimate Jam]\n*[http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Hollywood_Party Hollywood Party]\n*[[Club Penguin Star Wars Takeover]]\u00a0(as\u00a0[[Princess Leia Organa|Princess Cadence]])\n*[http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Teen_Beach_Movie_Summer_Jam Teen Beach Movie Summer Jam]\n*[http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Music_Jam_2014 Music Jam 2014]\n*[http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/SoundStudio_Party Soundstudio Party ] (Only sprite)\n*[http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/10th_Anniversary_Party 10th Anniversary Party]\n\n==Plush Toy==\nClub Penguin released a Plush Toy for Cadence, which was in series 5,\u00a0She is the fifth famous penguin that has a matching plush.\n\n==Other Names==\n*Mix Master\n*Dancing Machine\n*DJ K-Dance\n\n==Dance Moves==\n*\"[[w:c:clubpenguin:Actions|Thriller]]\" move\n*\"[[w:c:clubpenguin:Actions|Headphone]]\" move\n*\"[[w:c:clubpenguin:Actions|Airplane]]\" move\n*\"[[w:c:clubpenguin:Actions|Breakdancer]]\" move\n*\"[[w:c:clubpenguin:Actions|Penguin Slide]]\" move\n*\"[[w:c:clubpenguin:Actions|Coffee Dance]]\" move\n\n==Trivia==\n*Cadence's favorite move is the Breakdance.\n*She is the only known penguin to have eyelashes, besides [[Dot the Disguise Gal|Dot]]\u00a0from ''[[w:c:clubpenguin:Club Penguin: Elite Penguin Force|Club Penguin: Elite Penguin Force]]'', and [[Puffle Handler]].\n*When she is talking, she usually says at least one word in capital letters (e.g., \"let's DANCE!\").\n*The word \"cadence\" is a term in music describing a progression of chords; fittingly, she is a DJ.\n*When the player uses CP Typhoon, they can look at the mascot script which shows Cadence's Script, [[Rockhopper]]'s Script and [[Sensei]]'s Script.\ufeff\n*Her puffle is named ''Lolz'' because she always made her laugh.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nCnpc.png\n640px-Cadence's_Signature.PNG|Cadence's signature\nCadenceTBMBG.png|One of Cadence backgrounds\nCadence_in_-The_Party_starts_now!-..jpg|Cadence as seen in The Party Starts Now\n640px-ROCKY_CECE_CADENCE_1000.PNG|Cadence with Rocky and CeCe\nca.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n<references />\n{{Club Penguin}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Club Penguin characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Penguins]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in video games]]\n[[Category:Club Penguin]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]"
