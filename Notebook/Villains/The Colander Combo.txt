"{{Infobox character\n|name = The Colander Combo\n|image = Kkveggies.jpg\n|rides = [[Kitchen Kabaret]]|shorts = [[Harold and His Amazing Green Plants]]}}'''The Colander Combo''' is a trio of anthropomorphic vegetables who were featured performers in the former [[Kitchen Kabaret]] show at [[Epcot]].\n\nThis Latin-style trio consisted of a tomato playing bongos, an eggplant playing maracas, and Mr. Broccoli playing a xylophone.\n\nThey sang the song \"[[Veggie, Veggie, Fruit, Fruit]]\" along with [[The Fiesta Fruit]] and [[Bonnie Appetite]].\n\nThe Colander Combo, sans their performing outfits, would appear in the 1984 educational film [[Harold and His Amazing Green Plants]] to teach the title character about how plants grow.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Mr. Broccoli (who would occasionally flip off his sunglasses and shout \"Cha-cha-cha!\") became the most popular character in the show, similar to how [[Big Al]] did in the [[Country Bear Jamboree]].\n*Broccoli & Co., the gift shop that was located near the show's exit, was named after Mr. Broccoli.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nKkfireworks.jpg\nColanderComboAnimated.jpg|The Colander Combo in [[Harold and His Amazing Green Plants]]\n400003463503-2.jpg|Mr Broccoli as part of a VInylmation set\n</gallery>\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Colander Combo, The}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Character trios]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Foods]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]\n[[Category:Bands]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Kitchen Kabaret characters]]"
