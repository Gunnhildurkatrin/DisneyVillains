'''Experiment 489''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]]. He is designed to use his tentacles to squeeze the life out of his victims.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Stitch! The Movie]]''===\nExperiment 489 was the 489th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to squeeze the life out of his victims with his tentacles.\u00a0489 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai, with 489's pod landing on top of a buoy.\n\nLater, a tidal wave splashed over the buoy, activating the experiment.\n\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nAt an unknown point after this, Experiment 489 was presumably captured and named Huggo.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nAll 624 experiments, including Huggo, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium\u00a0to be destroyed. However, Lilo, Stitch, Jumba, Pleakley, Reuben and Gantu arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nIt is unknown whether or not\u00a0Huggo participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]].\n\nThe Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Huggo is one of only two 4-series experiments that have their image, name, number, and function confirmed, the other being [[Mary (Lilo & Stitch)|Mary]]. Interestingly, both debuted in ''[[Stitch! The Movie]]''.\n*Huggo is one of the only known experiments with six limbs; in this case, they are tentacles. [[Splodyhead]] has six limbs: two arms and four hind tentacles, and uses either four or all six for locomotion. [[Swapper]] also has six limbs, but only uses two or four for locomotion.\n*Huggo and [[Thresher]]\u00a0have very similar heads/faces.\u00a0Perhaps they were created using some of the same DNA.\n*Huggo, [[Clink]], and Thresher are the only known experiments with stalked eyes, a trait common in the invertebrates that all three are inspired by.\n*Huggo and [[Yin]] are the only known experiments based on cephalopods. Though given Huggo and Thresher's uncanny resemblance, Thresher may also be cephalopod-like.\n*In one scene, Huggo's [[Experiment Pods|pod]] was green, and in another, it was red.\n**On a similar note, Huggo has appeared in different colors. In ''Stitch! The Movie'', he was red, but in ''[[The Origin of Stitch]]'', he was blue.\n*Huggo is one of the few experiments to not appear in the group photo at the end of ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''.\n*With only one brief animated scene and no other appearances in [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|the franchise]] (apart from his image being used in ''[[The Origin of Stitch]]'' and erroneously referred to as Experiment 144), Huggo most likely has the least amount of screen time out of all the fully-confirmed experiments. (The aforementioned Mary has a briefer, less animated scene in ''Stitch! The Movie'', but she also appears animated in ''Leroy & Stitch''.)\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\">\nscreenCapture 07.07.13 22-40-58.jpg|Huggo's experiment pod\nscreenCapture 07.07.13 22-41-13.jpg\nscreenCapture 07.07.13 22-43-01.jpg\nscreenCapture 07.07.13 22-43-46.jpg\nscreenCapture 07.07.13 22-45-02.jpg\nscreenCapture 07.07.13 22-45-26.jpg\nscreenCapture 07.07.13 22-46-00.jpg\nscreenCapture 07.07.13 22-47-07.jpg\nscreenCapture 07.07.13 22-49-07.jpg\nscreenCapture 07.07.13 22-50-00.jpg\nscreenCapture 07.07.13 22-50-10.jpg\nscreenCapture 07.07.13 22-50-24.jpg\nscreenCapture 07.07.13 22-52-02.jpg\nscreenCapture 07.07.13 22-55-58.jpg\nscreenCapture 07.07.13 22-56-32.jpg\nscreenCapture 07.07.13 22-57-41.jpg\nscreenCapture 07.07.13 22-58-14.jpg\nThe Origin Of Stitch Huggo.jpg|Misidentified as Experiment 144 (Samolean)\n</gallery>\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Cephalopods]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
