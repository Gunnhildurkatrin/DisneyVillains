She is confident, eager and very friendly, albeit in a rough way. She enjoys relaxing and hanging out with Sprig and is willing to jump into action if given the opportunity. Like most children however, she cares very much for her mother and when things get scary, is shown to cling to her like most children do. She tends to be impatient when it comes to her mother\u2019s rules and expectations, but she comes to accept them upon learning Felicia\u2019s past and intentions to take her on an adventure someday.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nIvy Sundew is close in age to Sprig, but is slightly shorter and stouter than him. She is yellow with a light yellow underbelly and possess orange hair that stick out in tufts underneath her teal beanie. She wears a light blue shirt and denim dungarees to go along with them. She is barefoot with two toes, has three fingers and light violet tongue.\n\n== Relationships ==\n\n=== Sprig Plantar ===\nIvy had been friends with Sprig for a long time. The two are so close that they are comfortable with rough housing with one another and hanging out casually. While not confirmed until \"[[Anne of the Year]]\", Ivy has apparently had a crush on Sprig for a long time. This was slightly hinted at in \"[[Croak and Punishment]]\" where she opted to have a Blue Moon Shell, which was initially meant for her as a birthday present, stay with Sprig so that she will know when she is close to his house. It is confirmed that they are very much in love with one another and will someday go on a date. \n\n=== Felicia Sundew ===\nIvy loves her mother, but she was initially shown to be strict and overbearing to her. Felicia expected Ivy to obey her and complete her chores perfectly. Ivy lacked the patience to put up with Felicia\u2019s rules, but soon learned that her mother was teaching her self-defense through those strict chores. Ivy came to appreciate her mother for understanding her desire for adventure and promising to take her on one in the future. Ivy cares about Felicia and is shown to hug her mother whenever something dangerous is happening. Ivy is also shown to help Felicia with running her tea shop and hold her mother\u2019s hand like most children do.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Ivy seems to be the only true friend that Sprig has ever had. Though it can be argued that Maddie Flour is also a close friend.\n*While most animated shows tend to develop romantic relationships over the course of the series' run, Ivy and Sprig's relationship was made official by the end of the first season.\n*Ivy's full name, Ivy Hibiscus Matcha Sundew, are all names of plant or tea related things. Ivy, or Hedera, is a type of climbing vine that itself carries various subset plants. Hibiscus is a type of flower found in tropical climate areas that can be used to make Hibiscus tea. Matcha is finely ground powder made from green tea leaves that are most commonly made in East Asian countries. The Sundew, or Drosera, is a small carnivorous plant that is called so because of its liquor like dew that hangs from its leaves. Each name perfectly summarizes her character as well as various themes of the show.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\">\nMom , please stop.png\nMuch better.png\nDating Season 3.png\nAnne of the Year 4.jpg|Lvy revealing to have a crush in [[Sprig Plantar|Sprig]].\nReturn to Wartwood still 6.png\nReturn to Wartwood still 13.png\nReturn to Wartwood still 14.png\nReturn to Wartwood still 25.png\nReturn to Wartwood still 26.png\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*[[w:c:amphibiapedia:Ivy Sundew|Ivy Sundew]] at the [[w:c:amphibiapedia:Main Page|Amphibia Wiki]]\n\n{{Amphibia}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Amphibia characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Frogs]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]"
