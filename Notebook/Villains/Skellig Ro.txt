It is also shown that he is capable of controlling the weather, which he uses to test the skills of those who wish to learn from him.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nSkellig Ro Art.png\n</gallery>\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Miles from Tomorrowland}}\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Miles from Tomorrowland characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Mentors]]"
