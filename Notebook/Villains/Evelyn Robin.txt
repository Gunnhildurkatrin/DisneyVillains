During a conversation with Evelyn, she explains to her husband that there are perfect schools for Madeline that do not require them to send her away and also while talking, she explains about Christopher has to adapt to having a new life in the real world rather than having fun with Winnie the Pooh and his friends at the Hundred Acre Wood.

Evelyn then tells her daughter Madeline, sharing her sorrow with her daughter that her husband cannot stay, because Christopher has to work at Winslow Enterprises while Madeline has boarding school. To cheer herself up, Madeline decides to have fun.\n\nLater during a plan to find Christopher Robin, Madeline, Pooh, and his friends from the Hundred Acre Wood pass by her family's house just as her mother asks her if she would like some lemonade, only to find out that Madeline has left a note linked to Christopher Robin. Furthermore, Evelyn comes to the rescue and tries to catch up with Madeline while arriving at London who is trying to find her father.\n\nKatherine Dane later arrives at the bank, warning Christopher that his wife Evelyn couldn't find her daughter and thanks to Katherine's advice, Christopher reunites with his wife just as the couple rides on a car to find Madeline so she can reunite with her family again much to Winslow's worry.
