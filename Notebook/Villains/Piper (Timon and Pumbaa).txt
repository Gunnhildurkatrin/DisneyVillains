She is voiced by [[April Winchell]].\n\n==Background==\n===Physical Description===\nPiper is a physically large flying squirrel with purple fur and a pale face and underbelly. She also has dark markings on her head, face, and paws. She wears bright pink lipstick and has a red nose and blue eyes. Additionally, she wears a pink ribbon around her neck.\n\n===Personality===\nPiper is outgoing. However, she tends to be satirical at times. She is also selfish, as she initially refused to help [[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]] get beetles unless they helped her. She is also dishonest, as even after they held up their end of the bargain, she still failed to help them. Despite her bad points, Piper is incredibly stubborn, as she would not give up her romantic pursuit of another flying squirrel.\n\n==Appearances==\n===\"[[Saskatchewan Catch]]\"===\nPiper accidentally hit [[Timon]] while she was trying to catch her unnamed love interest. Timon and [[Pumbaa]] wanted to get some beetles that were at the top of the trees, and they needed Piper's help to reach them. However, she only agreed to help them once they agreed to help her get the attention of the aforementioned flying squirrel. \n\nEventually, Timon and Pumbaa successfully got the male flying squirrel to fall in love with Piper, and they decided to mate. Piper then flew off, leaving Timon and Pumbaa, and thus not staying true to her word.\n\n===\"[[Around the World with Timon & Pumbaa]]\"===\nAfter [[Pumbaa]] got struck by lightning and became amnesiac, [[Timon]] brought Piper to him in an effort to get his memories back.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Piper's voice actress April Winchell voiced three other characters in Timon & Pumbaa, which are [[Frieda]], [[Madame Credenza]], and [[The Tigress]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nPiper 1.jpg\nPiper 2.jpg|Piper and her unnamed mate\nPiper 3.jpg|Timon with Piper and her mate\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Lion King}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Timon & Pumbaa characters]]\n[[Category:Squirrels]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]"
