"[[File:Letters_to_Santa_(6).jpg|thumb|200px]]'''Officer Frank Meany''' is an airport security guard seen in the ''Muppets''\u00a0television special ''[[A Muppets Christmas: Letters to Santa|Letters to Santa]]''. He works alongside [[Bobo the Bear]]. Officer Meany is bitter and rude, which the Muppets discover is due to his getting on [[Santa Claus|Santa's]] naughty list as a child because of his bullying, denying him the red tricycle he wanted for Christmas.\n\nIn an attempt to get on the good list, he lets the Muppets pass through security to deliver their letters to Santa. He had written a letter to Santa asking to get off the naughty list, a wish that is granted by Santa due to his gesture.\n\n{{MuppetWiki}}\n\n{{The Muppets}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Meany, Frank}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Police officers]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]"
