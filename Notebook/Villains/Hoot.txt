He is a great horned owl and one of\u00a0[[Warwick]]'s loyal henchmen, the other being the [[Halloween Hound|Howlloween Hound]].\u00a0\n\n\n\n==Background==\n75 years ago, Hoot served as one of Warwick's henchmen. Warwick and the Howlloween Hound had struck an agreement to rule the world together. Hoot had doubts about Warwick's plan, but Warwick refused to listen to Hoot and insulted the owl. However, after four of the puppies already had their souls taken, [[Pip (Spooky Buddies)|Pip]] bit Warwick's hand and attempted to escape. As Pip's soul was about to be consumed, the sun began to rise and expelled the Howlloween Hound back to the netherworld. Cornered by the [[Sheriff Dan|sheriff]], Warwick jumped in the mirror to the netherworld alongside the Howlloween Hound, much to Hoot's shock and dismay.\n\n==Role in the film==\n75 years have passed, and after two boys went into the old manor and approached the mirror, Warwick and the Howlloween Hound\u00a0both escaped back into the real world. Hoot notices and informs Warwick, who uses a potion to turn the boys into rats. Warwick and the Howlloween Hound then set out to Fernfield to find the stuff that was needed to complete the ritual: his spellbook, his staff, and five puppies who share the same blood. Hoot was relieved to see Warwick safe, but he continued to act mean towards the owl and told him to go find the spellbook.\n\nWhile many kids were out trick-or-treating, Hoot notices Billy who had the staff in his possession, to which he later flies back to the manor to inform Warwick. After the Howlloween Hound captures the five Buddies, he imprisons them inside the manor. Warwick then tells Hoot to guard the cage containing the Buddies, threatening him that if he failed, he would turn the owl into a featherduster.\n\nShortly after, Pip enters Warwick's manor, where he and the Buddies manage to reason with Hoot\u00a0and tell him that he can reform. Hoot agrees and releases the Buddies, but then the Howlloween Hound sees that Hoot betrayed them, so he turns the owl into stone, leaving Hoot helpless. Pip and the Buddies get trapped, but Pip bravely informs the Howlloween Hound that he sucked his siblings 75 years ago. The Howlloween Hound turns Pip into stone as well, but Skip and Rodney's rat forms help them all escape.\n\nIn the end, the sun rose and all who had been turned into stone were back to normal with their souls in place, including [[Zelda (Spooky Buddies)|Zelda]], [[Deputy Sniffer]], Pip and his siblings, and even Hoot himself. Afterwards, Hoot flies out of the manor and perches in a nearby tree, where he presumably lives the rest of his now-peaceful life as a wise owl.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Hoot is the only antagonist to reform in the film, though it is unclear how he became Warwick's henchman.\n*During the 75 years, Hoot did not age whatsoever, nor did Warwick, the Howlloween Hound, Pip and his siblings.\n\n{{Air Bud}}\n[[fi:Huu]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Air Bud characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Owls]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]"
