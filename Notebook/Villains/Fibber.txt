'''Experiment 032''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]]\u00a0and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]]. He\u00a0is designed to detect lies; the more people lie, the more he buzzes, forcing entire populations to tell the truth. He was captured by [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]], but was rescued in \"[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]\".\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nFibber appears to be mute (except when buzzing at a lie) and sometimes blank, although he has displayed emotion on a few occasions. For example, in \"[[Spike (episode)|Spike]]\", when [[Pleakley]]\u00a0managed to convince the other experiments in his E.A.R.W.A.X. group to\u00a0attempt hugging therapy on each other, Fibber can actually be seen shedding tears.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nFibber is a small orange experiment with stubby limbs and a very large head with a dark orange marking on the forehead that glows bright yellow whenever he beeps. His head has little antennae and four ears at the base, a round nose, and black-blue eyes.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nWhenever he hears a lie, Fibber responds by emitting a loud buzzing sound and lights up the pattern on his forehead. The bigger the lie, the louder he beeps, and the brighter his marking glows.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment 032 was the 32nd genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to\u00a0use his lie-detecting ability to force entire civilizations to only ever tell the truth. Based on Jumba's incorrect theory, this would result in a societal collapse.\u00a0032 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.\n\nAt an unknown point after this, Experiment 032 was activated.\n\nAn estimated 12 hours after his activation, 032 was captured by [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Stitch]] and taken back to the [[Lilo's House|house]], where Lilo tried to look up 032 on [[Jumba's Computer|Jumba's computer]]. When [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] himself revealed which experiment it was, Lilo claimed she knew all along, causing 032 to\u00a0buzz loudly in response. He buzzed again when Lilo lied to [[Nani Pelekai|Nani]] about cleaning her room, making Stitch openly laugh at Lilo's dishonesty.\n\nThat night, while Stitch was forced to share his bed with 032, named Fibber, [[Pleakley]] received an inconvenient call from [[Mrs. Pleakley|his mother]]. She had been badgering her son about finding a wife, and even revealed to the latter that she'd selected a perfect bride on [[Plorgonar]] and hosted an arranged marriage. Pleakley felt heartbroken\u00a0over leaving his ''[[Pelekai \u02bbohana|\u02bbohana]]'' forever until Lilo and Jumba\u00a0convinced him to\u00a0lie his way out. So\u00a0Pleakley called his mother back and began to tell her about his fake proposal, while Fibber kept buzzing.\n\nShortly after, Pleakley's relatives arrived in person at the Pelekai residence to witness his sham engagement to Nani (who reluctantly posed as Pleakley's fianc\u00e9e), which led to a tragic wedding. Meanwhile, Lilo and Stitch attempted to hide Fibber in all sorts of places to drown out his frequent buzzing caused by Pleakley lying to his family.\n\nWhen [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] returned from a spa weekend, he discovered Fibber's recent activation, which [[Reuben|Experiment 625]] deliberately neglected to notify him about. Gantu later crashed the phony ceremony to try and\u00a0take the experiment, but was foiled by Lilo and Stitch, although Gantu managed to divulge Fibber's lie-detecting nature in the process.\n\nPleakley eventually told his relatives the truth, and while Fibber buzzed at the false comments they made about Pleakley, they were able to accept the fact that he was happy living on Earth and didn't want to get married. However, as Pleakley's family prepared to depart, Gantu reappeared in his\u00a0[[Manta Shuttle|shuttle]]\u00a0and captured Fibber. Regardless, Lilo decided to let Fibber stay with Gantu for now.\n\nBack at\u00a0[[Gantu's Ship|Gantu's ship]], Fibber buzzed when Gantu lied to [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]] about his\u00a0whereabouts, while Reuben befriended the lie-detecting experiment.\n\nIn \"[[Spike (episode)|Spike]]\", Fibber was one of the experiments in Pleakley's E.A.R.W.A.X. group. He buzzed during the therapy session whenever one of the other experiments lied (mainly [[Bonnie (Lilo & Stitch)|Bonnie]], when she lied about her being intelligent and falsely accused [[Clyde (Lilo & Stitch)|Clyde]] of getting them arrested). Earlier, Fibber buzzed when Pleakley denied the fact that his antenna was prematurely orange and simply dyed green. When the other experiments later began to cause chaos, Fibber watched nonchalantly while smiling.\n\nIn \"[[Remmy (episode)|Remmy]]\", Fibber was one of the experiments in Lilo's dream.\n\nIn \"[[Woops (episode)|Woops]]\", Fibber\u00a0was sent back to Gantu\u00a0after [[Woops|Experiment 600]] caused mischief and nearly blew H\u00e4msterviel's cover to the\u00a0[[UGF Troopers|prison guards]].\n\nFibber reappeared in \"[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]\", and was freed along with Gantu's other captive experiments by Lilo, Stitch, and several other experiments in a rescue mission.\n\n===''[[The Origin of Stitch]]''===\nFibber was one of the experiments that were gliding on the screen, but he is 580 instead of 032.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nThe first 624 experiments, including Fibber, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium\u00a0to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]], and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nFibber did not participate in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]], instead choosing to retreat with the weaker experiments. However, in one scene, Fibber can be seen around some of the Leroys as they started to shut down.\n\nThe Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Fibber was first revealed in a DVD bonus feature of ''[[Stitch! The Movie]]'' in the experiment gallery.\n*Fibber was activated off-screen.\n*In\u00a0[[Fibber (episode)|his debut]], it is revealed\u00a0that Fibber likes cookies, as he was seen raiding the cookie jar at one point.\n*In \"[[Spike (episode)|Spike]]\",\u00a0Fibber was seen at Pleakley's E.A.R.W.A.X. group, but Gantu captured him.\n**However, this episode was confirmed by [[Jess Winfield]] to take place chronologically after \"[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]\", considering the fact that [[Nosy]], [[Bonnie (Lilo & Stitch)|Bonnie]], and [[Clyde (Lilo & Stitch)|Clyde]] are also present in Pleakley's E.A.R.W.A.X. group.<ref name=\"WinfieldTVTome\">{{cite web|title=L&S Says Mahalo|url=http://lasfansite.atspace.me/stuff/history/tvtome/page03.html|website={{WikipediaLink|TV.com|TV Tome}}|via=Yet Another Lilo & Stitch Fansite|accessdate=May 27, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319134719/http://lasfansite.atspace.me/stuff/history/tvtome/page03.html|dead-url=no|archivedate=March 19, 2016|date=December 13, 2004}}</ref>\n*In \"Snafu\", Fibber did not buzz when [[Reuben]] denied being ticklish. Since the containers are oddly not soundproof, it is possible that Fibber wasn't paying attention. Arguably, Reuben may have been telling the truth, but is not immune to [[Tickle-Tummy]]'s tickling ability.\n*His number was also given to [[Hammerface]] in the English dub of ''[[Stitch!]]''.\n*Fibber's head appears in the online game ''[[Jumba's Lab (game)|Jumba's Lab]]''.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
