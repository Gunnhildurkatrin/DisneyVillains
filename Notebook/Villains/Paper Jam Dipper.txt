He is also unable to speak properly. At the end of \"[[Double Dipper]]\", he and the other clones disintegrate due to the fact that water is their weakness.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nPaper Jam Dipper tends to be too friendly with other clones and makes a lot of noise. No one can understand what he says, and one can only guess by the way he says it. He seems to be good friends to [[Tyrone]].\n\nWhen he, along with the other clones, were exposed to water and began disintegrating, he admits it would be best for him, showing he was aware he wouldn't have a chance to make any effort in life.\n\n===Physical Appearance===\nPaper Jam Dipper is a deformed clone. He has rounded teeth, wrinkled skin, a large stomach, and is taller than the other clones. The color on Paper Jam Dipper is a little faded and dark (separate).\n==Role in the series==\nPaper Jam Dipper was created by accident in an attempt to clone the fourth [[Dipper Pines|Dipper]] for a plan to steal [[Robbie (Gravity Falls)|Robbie]]'s bike, distracting him and giving Dipper a chance to ask [[Wendy (Gravity Falls)|Wendy]] to dance. He is excluded from all plans, and is disintegrated with clones 5-10 when the original Dipper sets off the emergency sprinklers.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nS1e7_paper_jam_dipper_is_born.png\nS1e7 paper jam dipper hugs number 3.png\nS1e7 pjd hungry.png\nTyrone With Paper Jammed Dipper Clone.png\nS1e7 farewell pjd.png|Paper Jam Dipper's death.\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*A cracker can't fit into his mouth if it's being held vertical.\n*His speech is garbled and can only be understood through the caption.\n**Also, when he disintegrates, the caption shows he refers to himself in third-person.\n*He seems to say \"Nang\", like the [[Klimpaloon]] from ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]''.\n{{GFWiki}}\n{{Gravity Falls}}\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Gravity Falls characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Alternate Forms]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Characters with disabilities]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Those destroyed]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
