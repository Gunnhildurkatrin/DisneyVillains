"{{Infobox character\n|name = Reggie the Brownie\n|image = 304px-Reggie.png\n|shows = ''[[American Dragon: Jake Long]]''}}'''Reggie'''<ref>http://www.jeffgoode.com/tv/americandragon/critters/brownie.htm</ref> is a character from the [[Disney]] cartoon series ''[[American Dragon: Jake Long]]''. He is a type of elf without magical abilities known as a Brownie. He was captured by the [[The Huntsclan|Huntsclan]] (along with other magical creatures) to be part of the annual Huntsclan hunting contest.<ref>[[The Hunted]]</ref>\n\n==Physical Appearance==\nLike other Brownies, Reggie stands just a few inches tall and is no bigger than an adult hand. He has pointy ears and red hair, which also are characteristics of his species. He wears a blue sleeveless vest over his green shirt, a pair of brown pants, beige shoes, and uses a rope as a belt. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n==Personality==\nAs part of the \"Flawed Group\", Reggie has some severe anger-management issues, while most elves are gentle, kind, and peaceful. He denies this very aggressively, ironically proving it right. He gets mad at absolutely everything, and is not afraid to show it. He even admits to hating everyone, even himself. Reggie can also be very aggressive in battle: during some combat training, he became so frustrated that he tore apart a dummy's face. He's also a bit of a lone wolf, and stays with his gang of magical creatures only to get revenge over the Huntsclan.\n\nAt the end, however, Reggie seems to get better control over his tantrums. During a fight with the Huntsclan, he even puts aside his impulse of taking three enemies on himself and actually resorts to cunning in order to defeat them. His hate for his companions also seems to dissipate.\n\n==Episode Appearances==\n===Season One===\n*\"[[Dragon Summit]]\" (first appearance)\n*\"[[The Halloween Bash]]\"\n*\"[[The Hunted]]\" (final appearance)\n\n==Quotes==\n*(to Courtney) \"I'm whatever you want me to be, doll face.
