She is also seen as being quite athletic for her age though, taking up baseball and wrestling. She constantly beats up\u00a0[[Oscar Proud|Oscar]] whether he insults her or not, and constantly insults him, but in the end, she respects him deep down, stating \"sometimes I like you\".  Suga Mama is in love with [[Papi Boulevardez|Papi]]. On the contrary, Papi despises Suga Mama and often makes rude remarks about her in Spanish, which she usually thinks are compliments. Suga Mama's big sister, [[Sista Spice|Spice]] has telekinesis. She shows extra amounts of love for her poodle, [[Puff]]. She repeatedly shows no respect for Oscar and prefers her other son, [[Bobby Proud|Bobby]]. However, during ''[[The Proud Family Movie]]'', she finally gives him some respect and listens to him for once.\n\n== Background ==\nNot much is known about Suga Mama's early life, nor her age, this fact often being made fun of by Oscar, resulting in Oscar normally getting beat down by her. What is known is that she has an older sister called [[Sista Spice]] that was favored more by her parents than herself, perhaps explaining why she favors her older son Bobby over Oscar, despite Oscar being more productive and having a real job. In the episode, \"[[She Drives Me Crazy]]\", [[Trudy Proud|Trudy]] does mention that Suga Mama's driver's license expired in [[1938]]. An event from twenty years ago shows her looking exactly the same as before. However, while slimming down to fit into a wedding dress, her diet was so successful, that she gained the slim and attractive body she had as a young woman in her 20's. She is a former member of the Southern Belles, and worked as a mechanic during World War ll along with her friend and former rival Gertie Dinkins, where she met her future husband [[Percy Proud]].\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Suga Mama resembles and acts like [[Mama Odie]] from ''[[The Princess and the Frog]]'', which is another production of the creator, [[Bruce W. Smith]], created.\n*In some episodes, Suga Mama's arm and leg muscles vary from thick to thin ones and vice versa.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{The Proud Family}}\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:The Proud Family characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Grandparents]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Aunts]]\n[[Category:Martial Artists]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Wrestlers]]\n[[Category:Widows/Widowers]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
