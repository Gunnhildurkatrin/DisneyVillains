Her hair is tied in a ponytail, but the rest stays down. Dijonay wears a lavender button-up collared shirt that exposes her stomach with a sky blue jacket over it, which matches her bobbles and a blue skirt that reaches the top of her knees.\n\n== Personality ==\nDijonay is a rather complicated person. On the one hand, she's not exactly the most loyal of friends as she habit of back-stabbing people or not doing the things a friend should be doing. On the other hand, she does often feel bad when she does do these things and have a lot of regret. She has shown to be selfish but also caring at the same time. \n\nClearly not the most ideal of friends (as Suga Mama often tells Penny) but at least she does not treat Penny as poorly as LaCienega. \n\n==History==\n===''[[The Proud Family]]''===\nShe is [[Penny Proud|Penny]]'s selfish, chubby and enthusiastic best friend. She loves to gossip and has gotten Penny into trouble many times. She has an obsessive crush on [[Sticky Webb]], who is trying to avoid her affection. Eventually, Penny stopped trusting Dijonay, since the latter always mistreated her, though the girls still remain friends. Dijonay's name is a pun on dijonnaise, and she has nine wild younger siblings named after all spices, seasonings, and condiments.\u00a0That explains, it's fitting that Dijonay is an good cook. Her biggest talent however, is poetry writing and reciting. Penny got jealous of her once because they both discovered together that Dijonay was really better at it. She is also a member of the girl group LPDZ consisting of herself and her three friends Penny, LaCienega and Zoey. She stated that her family is originally from Louisiana meaning she was not born in Wizville. She's also know both Penny and LaCienega since they were preschool-aged.\n\nDijonay hasn't always been a great friend to Penny, but she has shown enough evidence that she does indeed care about her. \n\n==Episode Appearances==\nAll of the episodes.\u00a0\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Dijonay's name is a pun on the name of Best Foods'/Hellmann's Djionnaise - and she has nine younger siblings named after all spices, seasonings, and condiments.\n*In \"[[Makeover]]\", it is revealed Dijonay is putting a pillow inside of the back of Zoey's skirt.\u00a0\n*Despite being a recurring character, Dijonay, along with Penny, Trudy, Oscar, and Suga Mama are the only characters to be in all the episodes.\n*Despite Dijonay being an obvious poor influence/friend (unlike LaCienega, who acts selfishly out of insecurity), Penny never stops to be friends with her.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n{{The Proud Family}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jones, Dijonay}}\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:The Proud Family characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Martial Artists]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Cheerleaders]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Dancers]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Nieces]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Detectives]]"
