His kingdom is unnamed, though it is appears to be [[France|Frankish]] in nature as opposed to the [[England|Britannic]] basis for [[Dunwyn Castle|Dunwyn]].\n\nAt times, his kingdom is under siege by a rebel group commanded by the [[Marquis de Bouillabaisse]], a mirror image of how Dunwyn is regulartly threatened by [[Duke Igthorn]].\n\nHe does seem snooty in nature, such as when [[King Gregor]] marveled at a tapestry Marie had presented as a gift, Jean-Claude did not seem to show the same respect for a bird statue given to him in return. However, he kept his thoughts to himself and showed public gratitude to [[Princess Calla]].\n\nWhen the truth is shown that Marie has been really rude and obnoxious to Calla, King Jean-Claude does not put up with that behavior and humbly apologizes to Gregor for the trouble.\n\n==Appearances==\n*\"[[Princess Problems]]\"\n*\"[[May the Best Princess Win]]\"\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=150 captionalign=center position=center spacing=small>\nPrincess Problem .jpg\nGummi Bears Princess Problems Screenshot 5.JPG\nG1010.jpg\nclaude_2.jpg|King Jean Claude in Armor For War\nKing Jean.jpg\nScreen Shot 2014-11-13 at 1.59.13 pm.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Adventures of the Gummi Bears}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jean-Claude, King}}\n[[Category:Adventures of the Gummi Bears characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Kings]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:French characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]"
