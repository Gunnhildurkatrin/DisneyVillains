"[[File:Guardianserpent.jpg|thumb|250px]]The Aztec '''Guardian Serpent '''is a giant orange snake featured in the show ''[[American Dragon: Jake Long]]''. The Guardian Serpent guards one of [[The 13 Aztec Skulls|13 Aztec Crystal Skulls]]. It mainly appears once in Season 2 in the episode \"[[Breakout (American Dragon: Jake Long)|Breakout]]\".\n\n==Physical Appearance==\n\nThe Guardian Serpent has brownish-orange scales with a paler underbelly. Its tail ends with a rattle, just like rattlesnake's. It also has feather-like crests coming out of its neck and cheeks. It has a viciously fanged mouth, two green eyes and a golden Aztec crown on top of its head. The Aztec Skull it guards is placed on that very crown.\n\n==Magical Powers==\n\nThe Guardian Serpent is an extremely fast and agile creature. It whips the ground with its tail or lunges its head forward to attack. When it has captured its prey in its coils, it will squeeze it slowly and eat it mercilessly. Its scales are so hard that they cannot be cut through.\n\nIf the rattle at the tip of the Serpent's tail is ever torn off, it can grow back after some time.\n\n==Life in the Magical World==\n\nBecause it was assigned as a guardian to an Aztec Skull, the Guardian Serpent lives in a secluded cave inside Central Park in New York City. If someone ever tries to steal its Skull, it will fight against the intruder with all of its might. It will go as far as to chase them outside of its home. If the Skull is ever definitely taken from it, the Guardian Serpent will hunt whoever stole it until it retrieves its treasure.\n\n== Episode Appearance ==\n\n=== Season Two ===\n*[[Breakout (American Dragon: Jake Long)|Breakout]] (only appearance)\n\n==Defeat and Demise==\n\nAt the end of \"Breakout\", the Guardian Serpent is hit on the head by a green energy beam coming from the Huntsman's spear. It then collapses to the ground and is never seen to awaken. It is unclear if this blow actually killed the Guardian Serpent, but is considered likely since it is never seen again in the series.\n\n==Trivia==\n*It is possible that the Guardian Serpent was based on the Aztec/Mayan deity Quetzalcoatl, a feathered snake.\n*When Jake rips off the Guardian Snake's rattle, it is seen that its blood is not red but green.\n*Since the Guardian Serpent only appears at night, it is assumed to be nocturnal.\n*The Guardian Serpent also appears in \"[[Being Human]]\".\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\">\nGuardian Serpent.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{American Dragon: Jake Long}}\n[[Category:American Dragon: Jake Long characters]]\n[[Category:Snakes]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Presumably Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Mystical animals]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
