It appears throughout the attraction at many points.\n\n==Background==\n===Development===\nThe Raven was incorporated into the attraction as a tribute to [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and was to serve as the attraction's narrator, being the physical form that the [[Ghost Host]] would take. Eventually, this was toned down to the Raven cawing and speaking in addition to an unseen Ghost Host narration, going as far as the Raven's voice being recorded for the Stretching Room (\"Caw, Caw, he took the coward's way!\") and the Conservatory (Caw! Caw! You've disturbed another guest!\").\n\nUltimately, the Raven would just have no dialogue at all beyond his cawing.\n\n==Appearances==\n===The Haunted Mansion===\n{{Main|The Haunted Mansion (attraction)}}\nThe Raven appears in several rooms: The Conservatory, the Seance Room, the descent from the Attic in the trees and above the crypt of the [[Hitchhiking Ghosts]]. With his appearance in the conservatory, fans often associate the Raven as belonging to [[Madame Leota]].\n\n===[[Phantom Manor]]===\n{{Main|Phantom Manor}}\nThe Raven appears in the Music Room, the Seance Room, the Ballroom, the Graveyard, and Phantom Canyon.\n\n===''The Haunted Mansion'' (film)===\n{{Main|The Haunted Mansion (film)}}\nThe Raven appears in several scenes of the film, watching the Evers when they enter the house and appearing in the Seance room by Leota's crystal ball when [[Ramsley]] looks into it to spy on [[Jim Evers|Jim]]. It is revealed in a commentary by director Rob Minkoff that the producers did not use an actual raven to play the film's raven but instead, a harmless bird with African origins and similar characteristics to the raven due to the strict application of California's laws on domesticated birds of prey.\n\n===''The Ghost Gallery''===\nThe Raven appears in the cast-member made backstory to Disney World's Haunted Mansion where it is given the name of Richard Belle. In the story, Richard Belle was once the maternal uncle of George Gracey Jr. (a composite character of [[Master Gracey]] and the [[Ghost Host]]); however, George never knew him, as he died a year after his own birth. Years later when George became the master of Gracey Manor, Richard's widow Elma moved into Gracey Manor to become closer to the family. It was around this time that Elma had acquired a pet raven who she referred to as Richard and would often have long conversations with it, at one point even painting a portrait of it only for the family to realize that she had painted a portrait of her late husband. In 1920, a scream was heard from Elma's chambers, and when the family entered they found her dead, pointing towards her raven who then flew into the night.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nhaunted-mansion-disneyscreencaps.com-4253.jpg|The Raven as seen in the film\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Haunted Mansion}}\n{{Disney Crossy Road}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Raven}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Raven}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Magical Objects]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:The Haunted Mansion characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Crossy Road characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Birds]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Ravens]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
