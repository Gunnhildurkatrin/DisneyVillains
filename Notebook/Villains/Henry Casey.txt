He lives and bonds together with [[White Fang (character)|White Fang]]. He was the one seen by Lily, child of Moses. His love interest is Lily.\n\nHe gave Lily a white cloth when he returned into the tribe. Lily taught him how to use his bow. He was the one who planted the dynamite into the rocks that blocks the path of the animals. He also dreamed what Moses dreamed about, White Fang, Lily, but in that dream, also him.\n\n==Trivia==\n* The scene where Henry Casey falls into a river and down a waterfall is based off John Thornton falling into a river and drifting down the current from ''The Call of the Wild'', another novel written by Jack London.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nWhiteFang2MythoftheWhiteWolf-Still2.jpg|Henry with Lily\nscreen_image_260513.jpg|Lily showing Henry how to use a bow and arrow\nleggenda_di_zanna_bianca_scott_bairstow_ken_olin_007_jpg_mebw.jpg|Henry and Lily showing their feelings for each other\nwhite_fang_2_myth_of_the_white_wolf_1994_454x302_15404.jpg\nwhitefangii_0001.jpg|Henry with White Fang\nPKWjQPLyWLVGeF0UhKmWsvQK5Jw.jpg|Henry, White Fang, and Lily overseeing the the miners\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Casey, Henry}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:White Fang]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:White Fang characters]]"
