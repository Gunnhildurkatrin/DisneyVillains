He is noted for having a successful history of beach parties, music-playing, and surfing.\n\nHe came to reside under the heavily damaged clock-tower along the lagoon and the tourist-trade of the locals would make him the lagoon's mascot.\n\n=== Development History ===\nLagoona was created in the late 90s in response to the popularity of his [[Disney's Blizzard Beach|Blizzard Beach]] counterpart, [[Ice Gator]]. While Ice is a skier and sledder, he is a surfer. A third gator was planned for [[River Country]] named Ranger Gator, but was not implemented.<ref>https://twitter.com/JimShull/status/1422698688644665344</ref>\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n=== Typhoon Lagoon ===\nWhen first entering the park, a sand sculpture (in reality a statue) of Lagoona can be seen. Within the park, his \"home\" can be found at the board room under the clock tower, featuring memorabilia related to his surfing career. He will make appearances here for [[Theme Park Characters|meet 'n' greets]].\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nLagoonagator.jpg\nHighdry.jpg\nDSC 0019.JPG|A portrait of Lagoona looking over [[Mount Mayday]]\nTyphoon-lagoon.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n<references />{{Typhoon Lagoon}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Alligators]]\n[[Category:Advertisement characters]]\n[[Category:Character stubs]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Typhoon Lagoon]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
