He is [[Princess Elena|Elena's]] friend and rising star of the Royal Guard.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nGabe is a very enthusiastic, confident, and reasonable person. Gabe is also very protective of Elena and Isabel, because of this, he does not like [[Princess Elena|Elena]]'s take-charge approach mostly for the sake of his job. Gabe is very professional and takes his job very seriously.\n\nIt is shown in \"[[Spellbound]]\" that he is skeptical of [[Mateo]] being appointed Royal Wizard and doesn't believe that Mateo is meant to be one. Yet, he trusts Mateo and follows his orders to help save the rest of the people cast in stone. He also proves to be a good friend when he is the first to give Mateo the credit for saving the guests from [[Fiero]]'s spell.\n\n=== Physical Appearance ===\nGabe has a muscular, slender body with brown hair, brown eyes, thick eyebrows, and wears the blue guards' uniform.\n\n==Role in the Series==\nAt eighteen years old<ref>[https://twitter.com/_CraigGerber/status/761224069564010496]</ref>, Gabe makes his debut in \"[[First Day of Rule]]\" when Elena leaves Avalor Castle to visit the city. He formally introduces himself to her when she gets out of the carriage. When [[Princess Isabel]] wants to stay behind to draw the boats some more, Elena tells Gabe to watch her. Gabe is asking Isabel what it was like when her sister faced [[Shuriki]] when Isabel spots some purple dogs boarding a ship. When the pair investigates, the dogs are revealed to be Noblins who take them prisoner. When Elena appears and frees them, Gabe tells her to take her sister and go but Elena refuses. Elena talks to the Noblins and learns that they were taking the ships to get home after Shuriki imprisoned them.\n\nGabe is mostly seen throughout the series accompanying Elena for protection. In \"[[Prince Too Charming]]\" he learned that Elena's leadership style made her much nicer and more responsible in comparison to someone like Alonso. Prince Alonso made Gabe carry all the luggage and had him ride wherever he and Elena went on Pedro, an aged horse well past it's prime that Gabe termed \"The Slowest Horse in the Kingdom.\" This treatment annoyed and angered Gabe to no end and eventually went with Elena when she commandeered Alonso's chariot and forced the insensitive Prince to ride Pedro to get back at him. When [[King Juan Ram\u00f3n]] had Alonso help build the bridge he observed with vindictive enjoyment. \n\nHe makes his next biggest appearance in \"[[Olaball]]\" where he tries his best to make his father proud by playing olaball. When he does terrible he tells Elena that he was trying to be like his father. She soon tells him to play his own way. At first, he keeps following what his dad has been saying but soon starts playing his own way and wins the cup. He also proves to his father that he is a great Royal Guard by saving Princess Isabel's and Princess Cat's life. This makes his bond with his father stronger.  \n\nIn \"[[The Princess Knight]]\", he trains Elena for a fencing competition after Elena realizes that he lets her win, believing that she was good. He helps her train for two days getting up at five a.m., throwing mangoes at her, and making her climb up steps. Gabe helps her win by showing her sword moves and the leaping stag move. It's said that he's the best fencer in all of the guards and won the royal guard fencing competition.  \n\nIn \"[[The Curse of El Guapo]],\" Gabe was in the running to be Captain of the Royal Guard when his boss retired. Up against three other boys he goes on to compete against them in an obstacle course. Gabe took a cursed sword that made him act arrogant to help him win. Elena helps him realize that it is himself that makes a good guard, not the weapon. Then during the final obstacle, his fellow guard fell so Gabe turned around to help him finish the obstacle. After the obstacle final was over Princess Elena promoted him to be the new Captain of the Royal Guard.\n\nAfter learning of Esteban's original alliance with Shuriki, followed by Elena disowning him and stripping him of his position as Chancellor, Gabe agrees with Mateo to have the best of his Royal Guards trained to use magic to counter Esteban and Ash Delgado in the future. However, during the training, Gabe grows restless and impatient, and this leads to the guards botching a spell and making a mess of Avalor Palace. After Mateo reprimands Gabe for his impatience, he helps the guards fix their mistake before Elena and Naomi return and would have seen what happened.\n\n==Trivia==\n* In an alternate reality, Gabe is a baker.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nFirst Day of Rule 3.jpg|Gabe meets Elena\nElena of Avalor 08.jpg\nElena-of-Avalor-2.jpg\nAll Heated Up 6.png\nSpellbound 21.jpg\nSpellbound 23.jpg\nSpellboundEOA3.png\nPrince Too Charming 2.jpg\nOlaball 1.png\nOlaball 3.png\nThe-Princess-Knight-4.png\nThe-Princess-Knight-5.png\nMyFairNaomi4.jpg\nMy Fair Naomi 3.png\nEp23AGeckosTale10.png|Gabe in Elena's arms\nThe Gecko's Tale 19.jpg\nThe Gecko's Tale 5.png\nThe Gecko's Tale 7.png\nEp23AGeckosTale49.png\nEp23AGeckosTale79.png\nEp23AGeckosTale85.png\nParty of a Lifetime 20.png\nParty of a Lifetime 21.png\nParty of a Lifetime 14.png\nParty of a Lifetime 15.png\nParty of a Lifetime 4.png\nParty of a Lifetime 13.png\nBlockheads 8.png\nBlockheads 11.png\nBlockheads 1.png\nBlockheads 18.png\nBlockheads 22.png\nElena of Avalor Shapeshifters - Gang meets Cruz.png\nElena of Avalor Shapeshifters - Jaquin Trio.png\nSong of the Sirenas 40.jpg\nThe Tides of Change 10.png\nThe Tides of Change 32.jpg\nThe Tides of Change 3.png\nThe Tides of Change 4.png\nThe Tides of Change 36.jpg\nThe Magic Within 1.jpg\nElena of Avalor S3 1.jpg\nElena of Avalor S3 7.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\">\nElena of Avalor Dolls 3.jpg\nElena of Avalor Dolls 2.jpg\nElena of Avalor Figures.jpg\nElena of Avalor 2D cast concept.png\nElena of Avalor Deluxe Classic Doll Gift Set.jpg\nGabe Elena of Avalor.jpg\nGabe 2.png\nDisney Mini Doll Set - Elena Of Avalor & Friends.png\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Elena of Avalor}}\n[[Category:Elena of Avalor characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]\n[[Category:Lieutenants]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Captains]]\n[[Category:Shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Jaguars]]\n[[Category:Horsemen]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Generals]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]"
