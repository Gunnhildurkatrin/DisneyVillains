In a rather weird way, he would get them done. He also disturbs [[Fa Zhou|Mulan's father]], who was praying. During the end of the movie, he joined Mulan's ancestors' ghosts at the party along with the chickens.\n\n===''[[Mulan II]]''===\nIn the second movie, Little Brother watches Mulan training in the field. As [[Lesson Number One|a musical number]] is played,\u00a0Little Brother plays with the little girls as they learn how to fight.\n\n===Other appearances===\nLittle Brother makes a small cameo in ''[[Tarzan]]'' when several gorillas gather around [[Archimedes Q. Porter]] and shake him upside down, causing many items to fall from inside his pockets, one of them resembling Little Brother.\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*Little Brother's voice actor,\u00a0[[Chris Sanders]], also voiced [[Stitch]] in the ''[[Lilo & Stitch]]'' franchise.\n*Little Brother is the third dog to be owned by a [[Disney Princess]], with [[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]]'s dog [[Bruno (Cinderella)|Bruno]] being the first and [[Pocahontas (character)|Pocahontas]]' dog [[Percy (Pocahontas)|Percy]] (in [[Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World|the sequel]]) being the second.\n*The name \"Little Brother\" is possibly a reference to Mulan having a little brother in the original ''Ballad of Mulan''. Aptly enough, Mulan may have named her dog this because she considers him her adoptive \"brother.\"\n* Although Little Brother never appeared in the [[Mulan (2020 film)|2020 remake]], the scene where a young Mulan chases a chicken across the village pays homage to the scene where Mulan tells Little Brother to feed the chickens across the village.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\">\nMulan-disneyscreencaps.com-323.jpg\nMulan-Screencaps-mulan-751334 780 440.jpg\nMulan-disneyscreencaps.com-338.jpg\nMulan-disneyscreencaps.com-348.jpg|Little Brother with [[Fa Mulan|Mulan]].\nMulan-disneyscreencaps.com-448.jpg\nMulan2-disneyscreencaps.com-324.jpg|Little Brother with [[Cri-Kee]]\nMulan2-disneyscreencaps.com-466.jpg\nMulan2-disneyscreencaps.com-637.jpg\nMulan2-disneyscreencaps.com-640.jpg\nMulan2-disneyscreencaps.com-691.jpg|Licking one of the girls\nCameo 23 - Little Brother in Tarzan.PNG\n</gallery>\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nlilbrotherpin.png\nlittle_brother_plush.jpg\nMulan's puppy.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Mulan}}\n[[Category:Mulan characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Servants]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Disney Crossy Road characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
