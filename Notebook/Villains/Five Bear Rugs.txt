Zeke is used as the name of the band's tour bus, with the film's DVD commentary explaining he had passed away early on in their musical career and the bus name was a memorial to him.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Biography===\nFrom 1972's Country Bear Jamboree record album:\n\n''The Five Bear Rugs began playing music together when they were in first grade. Fifteen years later they were still playing\u2014in fourth grade! Zeke plays the banjo and wears glasses\u2014he\u2019s the only one who can read music. Fred plays the mouth harp and carries the tune (his wife says Fred is lazy, and a tune is the only thing he carries). Ted blows the white lightning jug, and Tennessee plays the one-stringed thing (he hopes one day to add more strings). Zeb plays fiddle, and Zeb\u2019s son Oscar accompanies his father on concert tours because Zeb\u2019s wife works (she models fur coats\u2014always the same one\u2014at a nearby boutique).''\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===''[[The Country Bears]]''===\nThe Country Bears, the film's equivalent to the Five Bear Rugs, were originally construction workers that sang together during lunch breaks. Their foreman Henry noticed their talent and the band was established in 1974 to massive success, spawning hit albums, a cartoon, and, anachronistically, the Disney theme park attraction itself.\n\nDuring the span of their career together, the band produced five albums.\n* \"The Album What That's Our First\"\n* \"This Here's the Untitled Album\"\n* \"Give Us Paws\"\n* \"To the Last Drop Water Tower\"\n* \"Straight Outta Pendleton\"\nAfter the massive failure of their attempt at entering the hip-hop scene with \"Straight Outta Pendleton\" and years of clashing egos, the band broke up and went their separate ways in 1991. About a decade later, young fan Beary Barrington would rally them back together for a benefit concert to save [[Country Bear Hall]].\n\n==Trivia==\n*One of the Oscar figures created for Disneyland's version of the show now resides in the Disney Archives, still wearing a cub scout uniform from the Vacation Hoedown.\n*According to early concepts for the attraction, including concept art and an early Bear Band Serenade demo, Zeke was originally envisioned as a percussionist playing cymbals, drums and cowbells.\n\n[[File:Bear Band Serenade Mineral King Demo|thumb|right|250px|\"Bear Band Serenade\" Demo]]\n\n*Tennessee was initially going to be called '''Lemonade. '''The opening verse of the song, according to the aforementioned demo, would've been:\n\n<poem>\n''The bear band bears are ready''\n''They're set to serenade''\n''Zeke and Zeb and Ted and Fred''\n''And a bear named Lemonade''\n</poem>\n\nWhen the verse was changed to:\n\n<poem>\n''The bear band bears will play now''\n''In the good ol' key of G''\n''Zeke and Zeb and Ted and Fred''\n''And a bear named Tennessee''\n</poem>\n\nHe was renamed Tennessee so it would rhyme with \"G\".\n* Zeke's singing voice from 1975 onward was modeled after the country singer and banjo player Grandpa Jones.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nCountryBearJamboree Poster.png\nCountryBearJamboreeBears.jpg\ncbj_bearband1974ww.jpg\nBearcountrychristmas1.jpg\n11401V-800.jpg\n4562298-14335669-thumbnail.jpg|Concept art of the band.\nWDW32502020Country20Bear20Band.jpg\ncountry bear 2.jpg\nattraction-rewind-country-bear-christmas-special-feat-1_1.jpg\nSTK683483.jpg\nTigger Movie Country Bears.jpg|Cameo in ''[[The Tigger Movie]]''.\n</gallery>\n{{The Country Bears}}\n[[Category:Bears]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Bands]]\n[[Category:Country Bear characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Spell Cards characters]]\n[[Category:Music groups]]"
