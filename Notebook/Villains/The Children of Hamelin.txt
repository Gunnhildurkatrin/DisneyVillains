So he uses his music to lead all the village children out of Hamelin and into an enchanted world, where they can play and laugh all day long.\n\nThey have appeared in ''[[The Pied Piper]]'' and in [[ABC]]'s ''[[Once Upon a Time]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===\nThe Children of Hamelin appear in ''Once Upon a Time'', as inhabitants of Fairytale Land.
