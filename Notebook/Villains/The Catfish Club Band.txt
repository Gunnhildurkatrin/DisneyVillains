They are the house band of the Catfish Club, the underground music [[Wikipedia:Club|club]] in Atlantica that existed in opposition to [[King Triton]]'s ban on music. Their band leader and vocalist is [[Sebastian]], who also plays maracas. While these specific characters make their d\u00e9but in ''Ariel's Beginning'', similar characters did appear in the \"[[Under the Sea]]\" sequence in the [[The Little Mermaid|first movie]].\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning]]''===\nThey first appeared when [[Ariel]] followed [[Flounder]] to the club, where they sang \"[[Jump in the Line (Shake Senora)]]\" with [[Sebastian]]. At first they were afraid of her because they thought she would tell [[King Triton]], but when she sings \"[[I Remember]]\"\u00a0they come out of hiding and sing with her and welcome her into the club and give her the nickname \"Red\". The next night Ariel brought [[King Triton's Daughters|her sisters]] to come and [[King Triton's Daughters|Arista]] got to play Cheeks's saxophone. However, [[Marina Del Rey|Marina]]\u00a0spotted Sebastian and told King Triton, who locked them, [[Sebastian]] and [[Flounder]] in the dungeon. Ariel\u00a0freed them and started to run away\u00a0and sang \"Shake Shake Senora\" again. Once they arrived at the shadowy place where Ariel found [[Queen Athena|her mother]]'s [[Queen Athena's music box|music box]], they couldn't go back to [[Atlantica]] with Ariel, Flounder, and Sebastian because they didn't want to be sent back to jail. However, when they returned to save Flounder and Ariel from Marina's [[Electric Eels]], they and Ariel were trapped by the eels. They were able to escape when Flounder tied the eels into a knot. King Triton arrived and took Ariel home, then they got a group hug. They arrived at King Trition's annoucement and bought back music and welcome Arista into the band and danced in the dancing train.\n\n==Known Members==\n*'''[[Sebastian]]''' ([[Samuel E.
