Timmy takes several pictures of the elves (which are subsequently deleted) before being sparkled by Lanny and carried back to his bed. After the delay in the Prep of Timmy's house causes [[Magee]] to declare \"Figgy Pudding\" (meaning that Santa has to skip Timmy's house this year), Wayne regains his enthusiasm for his job and works together with Lanny to try to help Santa find Timmy's house during the raging snowstorm.
