In the books, Tom was a young boy (about 12-13) growing up in the 1840s who was characterized as being overly cunning, lazy and manipulative. Due to these traits, Tom finds himself frequently ahead of his peers despite being disobedient and never following the rules however in-turn it results in him being spurned by his crush, [[Becky Thatcher|Becky]].\n\nBecause of this his stories revolve around his cunning exploits, pranks, rebuking society to partake in childish games but learning humility and putting others before him along the way.\n\nTom Sawyer made his first Disney appearances at the Disney theme-parks, before having received any appearances in other media.\n\n===Personality===\nTom is kind, gentle, and friendly, but also mischievous and boastful.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===Film===\n\n====''[[Tom and Huck]]''====\nTom notably appears in the Disney film, ''[[Tom and Huck]]'', played by [[Jonathan Taylor Thomas]]. Together with his best friend, [[Huckleberry Finn]], he went looking for the treasure of the evil [[Injun Joe]] while also trying to bring Injun Joe to justice for the murder of Dr. Robinson. In the end, he manages to defeat Injun Joe and is hailed as a hero in his town.\n\n====''[[The Adventures of Huck Finn]]''====\nHe has one shot in ''The Adventures of Huck Finn'', where he is played by Danny Tamberelli as he shouts \"Go for the glory!\".\n\n===Television===\n\n====''[[Once Upon a Time]]''====\nTom appeared in ''Once Upon a Time'', played by child-actor Reilly Jacob. Here he was shown as a slacking off child at the [[Storybrooke]] school where he aggravated his teacher [[Snow White|Mary-Margarett]].\n\n===Printed Materials===\n\n====[[Kingdom Keepers]]====\nTom Sawyer briefly appeared in the first-book [[Kingdom Keepers I: Disney After Dark]], where he was encountered by protagonist  [[Finn Whitman]].\n\n===Video Games===\n\n====[[The Chase on Tom Sawyer's Island]]====\nTom is the protagonist in this Pac-Man inspired game where players must outrun bears on Tom Sawyer Island.\n\n===[[Disney Parks]]===\n\n====[[Club 33]]====\nOne of the booths in Club 33 depicts Tom and Huck on a raft, looking upon the Mark Twain Riverboat.\n\n====[[Main Street, U.S.A.]]====\nA window on Main Street advertised, \"SAWYER FENCE PAINTING\", a business in Anaheim, California and Lake Buena Vista, Florida run by one Tom Nabbe. This is a tribute to Disneyland actor Tom Nabbe who portrayed Tom Sawyer at the parks.\n\n====[[Tom Sawyer Island]]====\nTom Sawyer's Island is themed around Jackson Island, the island which he, Huck and Harper escape to to play pirate. The island is an interactive attraction themed around the characters of Mark Twain with many allusions to Tom, including his treehouse and messages from him being found.\n\n=====Pirate's Lair on Tom Sawyer Island=====\nPirate's Lair on Tom Sawyer Island was a refurbishment made to tie the attraction of [[Disneyland]] in with the ever-popular ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean (franchise)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' franchise. Newspaper clippings and messages referenced the island's fictional history, being known as Jackson Island (from the books) which here was once a smuggling port for pirate's like [[Jack Sparrow]] and [[Jean Lafitte]] with remnants of their exploits still being found on the island. The island later served as a base for the Americans during the War of 1812 when they made allies with the smugglers and pirates of the Mississippi.\n\nThe island would be traveled to by the boys Tom Sawyer, Huck Finn and Joe Harper as part of their adventures. During this time they turned the island into their own pirate's lair due to their love of piracy, with Tom declaring himself as, \"''The Black Avenger of the Spanish Main''\".\n\n====[[Mark Twain Riverboat]]====\nTom Sawyer is brought up by the captain of the Mark Twain Riverboat in Disneyland when passing by the Pirate's Lair on Tom Sawyer Island. The captain mentions how Tom Sawyer always wanted to be a pirate before an audio-clip of Tom plays with him saying, \"It\u2019s just the life for me! You don\u2019t have to get up mornin\u2019s. And you don\u2019t have to go to school, and wash, and all that blame foolishness. You see, a pirate don\u2019t have to do anything!\".\n\n====Liberty Belle Riverboats====\nTom Sawyer is brought up by the ride's narrator Sam Clemens (Tom's real-life creator) on this attraction. While passing by the island, the ride's Sam mentions having been close friends with Tom and the gang growing up and that he played with them on Tom Sawyer Island.\n\n====[[Theme Park Characters|Meet 'n' Greets]]====\nTom Sawyer and Huck Finn are both established [[Theme Park Characters/Face Characters|characters to meet]] at the Disney Parks (namely Disneyland) although they have become progressively more rare over the years.
