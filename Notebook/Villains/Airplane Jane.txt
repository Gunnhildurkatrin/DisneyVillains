Jane was once a finishing school attendee with [[Princess Grace]] of [[Walla-Walla-Bing-Bang]], but \"never finished\".\n\nDespite her show-offish attitude (she never misses a chance to rub it to Baloo that she is the better pilot) and often sneaky, competitive nature, she also has a heart of gold underneath and would help out a friend in need.\n\nHer only appearance is in the episode \"[[Waiders of the Wost Tweasure]]\".\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\">\nWaiders-of-the-Wost-Twearure-14.png|Baloo and Kit meet Plane Jane.\nWaiders-of-the-Wost-Twearure-11.png\nWaiders-of-the-Wost-Twearure-15.png\nWaiders-of-the-Wost-Twearure-19.png\nAirplane_Jane.jpg\nWaiders-of-the-Wost-Twearure-28.png\nWaiders-of-the-Wost-Twearure-29.png\n45_05.jpg\nWaiders-of-the-Wost-Twearure-34.png\nWaiders-of-the-Wost-Twearure-37.png\n45_09.jpg\nWaiders-of-the-Wost-Twearure-39.png\n45_10.jpg\nWaiders-of-the-Wost-Twearure-40.png\nWaiders-of-the-Wost-Twearure-42.png\nWaiders-of-the-Wost-Twearure-45.png\nWaiders-of-the-Wost-Twearure-46.png\n45_12.jpg\nWaiders-of-the-Wost-Twearure-48.png\n45_13.jpg\nWaiders.jpg\nWaiders-of-the-Wost-Twearure-50.png|Baloo and Jane find the Ruby Wings only to find out they have been followed.\n45 15.jpg\nWaiders-of-the-Wost-Twearure-55.png\nWaiders-of-the-Wost-Twearure-57.png|Jane and Baloo at Grace's coronation.\nWaiders-of-the-Wost-Twearure-58.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{TaleSpin}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jane}}\n[[Category:TaleSpin characters]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Hippopotamuses]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
