These two work for the [[Time Baby]]. They are heavily implied to be the Squadron's top agents.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Season 1 ===\nIn \"[[The Time Traveler's Pig]]\", shortly after\u00a0[[Dipper Pines|Dipper]]\u00a0and\u00a0[[Mabel Pines|Mabel]] arrive back in the present after their time-traveling adventure, Lolph and Dundgren come to the site to arrest\u00a0[[Blendin Blandin]], who is charged with the twins' \"violations of the time travelers' code of conduct.\" Blendin tries to explain the situation as the agents drag him away, but they do not believe him, especially after he tries to convince them that Mabel's\u00a0pig\u00a0is their leader. After\u00a0[[Stan Pines|Stan]]\u00a0challenges Lolph to try and dunk him, Lolph blasts the dunk tank with his\u00a0laser arm cannon, successfully knocking Stan down in the process. The agents then return to their own time with Blendin and hand him over to the\u00a0[[Time Baby]].\n\n=== Season 2 ===\nIn \"[[Blendin's Game]]\", Lolph and Dundgren were in charge of bringing Blendin in after he escaped from the\u00a0Infinetentiary. However, upon being caught, Blendin invokes\u00a0Globnar and selects Dipper and Mabel as his opponents. The pair are then ordered to bring Dipper and Mabel to the Globnar arena, but the twins manage to escape to the past when Mabel tricks Lolph into thinking that she was one of his ancestors. Escorting a restrained Blendin, they follow the pair back in time to ten years before their time of origin, and hunt them through\u00a0Gravity Falls\u00a0until the Pines turn themselves in.\n\nIn \"[[The Last Mabelcorn]]\", a picture of them from \"Blendin's Game\" is shown as\u00a0Bill\u00a0mentioned picking his next pawn.\n\nIn \"[[Weirdmageddon Part 1]]\", Lolph and many other members of the Time Paradox Avoidance Enforcement Squadron, are vaporized by\u00a0[[Bill Cipher]]\u00a0when trying to stop him from destroying space and time, leaving Blendin the only one left\n\n== Trivia ==\n* <span>Despite his apparent death, however in the Gravity Falls:\u00a0</span>''Journal 3''<span>\u00a0it was revealed that the Squadron used holograms of themselves to confront Bill Cipher in the present, meaning the real Loph is still alive and well.</span>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nBlendin Blandin with hair.png\nBlendin's Game.png\ndundgren.png|Dundgren\nlolph.png|Lolph\nS1e9 time police.png\nS2e8_lolph_and_dundgren_chasing.png\nS2e8 Key.png\nS2e8 def the dumbest.png\nS2e8_surrounded.png\nS2e8_last_words.png\nS2e8 nice aim.png\nS2e8 stripped of title.png\nS2e8 crew in past.png\nS2e8_blendin_search.png\n</gallery>{{GFWiki}}\n{{Gravity Falls}}\n[[Category:Gravity Falls characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
