Buttowski''' is [[Kick Buttowski (character)|Kick]] and [[Brad Buttowski|Brad's]] spoiled little sister. She usually competes in beauty pageants and recitals, with varying levels of success.\n\nIn \"[[Not Without My Cereal]]\", she takes Kick's cereal and runs around the grocery store, acting as the antagonist, but eventually helps Kick in the end.\n\n==Appearance==\nBrianna seems to have inherited the shortness genes in the family and looks abnormally stubby for a girl of her age. She has blonde hair, which is somewhat styled to resemble her favorite television character, \"Teena Sometimes\" (although Brianna's bangs are curled away, with her hair is pulled into a puffed ponytail). She has noticeable blue eyes and a small nose. Brianna is seen with a small crown on her head to resemble the one worn by Teena Sometimes, and she also wears pearl earrings.\n\nHer common attire consists of a pink shirt over a purple jacket, blue jeans, and pink boots. Due to her idolization of Teena Sometimes, and given her family's hair coloring, blonde may not be her natural hair color.\n\n==Family==\nBrad is her older brother and so is Kick. Little is known of her relationship with Brad, but it is shown that she has a Love-Hate Relationship with her other brother, Kick. She teases Kick about his real birth name, calling him \"Clarence\" (like [[Kendall Perkins|Kendall]]) and often takes what is precious to him, like Trike X-5 and his cereal but she does have a mutual respect for Kick and helps him out occasionally.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\n640px-Itunes_brianna_sispact.jpg\nBrianna.JPG\n640px-Teena_flash_mob.jpg\nBrianna_Penelope_rivalry.jpg\nBrianna.PNG\n640px-Petrified!_honey&brianna.jpeg\n640px-Petrified!_fathoney&brianna.jpeg\nMwnc_kick&brianna.jpg\nNflix_b_vs_p.jpg\nNwmc_cutebrianna.jpg\nNwmc2.jpg\nSc_02.png\nSc_03.png\nSc_04.png\nSc_05.png\nSc_07.png\nSc_08.png\nSc_11.png\nSisterpact1.jpg\nSisterpact2.jpg\nSisterpact3.jpg\nNwnc kickbrianna&honey.jpg\n640px-Kickbri.PNG\ntumblr_mcknwnUQ6i1r9zy3co1_1280.jpg\nItunes kick family aaction.jpg\nSc 10.png\nPenelope painted.jpg\nPenelope flip out.jpg\nPenelope laugh.jpg\nbrianna thumb up.jpg\nButtowski siblings photo.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Kick Buttowski: Suburban Daredevil}}\n[[Category:Kick Buttowski characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Dancers]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
