She almost gets eaten by the [[Wolf (Make Mine Music)|wolf]] but manages to survive. She is sometimes afraid as seen when she imagines the wolf scaring her, and when she swims across a frozen lake to escape from the wolf.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Make Mine Music]]''===\nSonia first appears when she comes out of some bushes (thus revealing she is not the wolf) and greets [[Peter (Make Mine Music)|Peter]], wanting to join him and Sasha on their wolf hunt. She eventually gets curious of Peter's popgun as she pretends to use it to hunt the wolf. She even imagines herself capturing it, but soon runs away in terror because of it scaring her and hides under the snow, to which Sasha calls her a coward. She then accompanies Peter, Sasha, and later [[Ivan]] on their wolf hunt. She is later chased by the wolf and gets separated from the rest of the group. When she tries to hide inside a tree and gets intercepted by the wolf, she is supposedly eaten by it, and the gang has a thought about her going to Heaven. However, Sasha avenges the incident by taking on the wolf. At the end of the segment, it is revealed that Sonia is not dead, and she and Sasha go off to see the victory parade.\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\nSonia made a few cameos as a guest in the show.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink|Sonia}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Sonia is represented in the music by an oboe.\n\n{{Make Mine Music}}\n\n[[fr:Sonia]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Make Mine Music characters]]\n[[Category:Russian characters]]\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Hunters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Peter and the Wolf]]"
