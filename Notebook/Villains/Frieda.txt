She is voiced by [[April Winchell]].\n\n==Background==\n===Physical Description===\nFrieda is a tall and slim human with blond hair and caucasian skin. She wears a pink parka, blue earrings, blue boots, and blue hair ribbons. She has blue eyes. She also wears mauve lipstick.\n\n===Personality===\nFrieda is friendly. Frieda is also a giving spirit. This can be seen when she willingly gave up the time she was spending with Fronk to go with him to the clocktower. Additionally, Frieda is caring, expressing concern over Fronk losing his job as timekeeper. She not only felt this way knowing how much it meant to him, but also because she loves the clock herself.\n\n==Appearances==\n===\"[[Swiss Missed]]\"===\nFrieda was skiing in the Alps with her fiance, [[Fronk Fegnugen|Fronk]], making future plans with him. Suddenly, [[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]] approached them with a problem: the town's clock had stopped working, and the town could not operate properly without the correct time. The four of them then skiied back down, Fronk and Frieda stopping quickly at a chapel to get married before heading off to the clocktower. \n\n[[Quint|Clockwork Quint]] appeared at the clocktower to take Fronk's job, since the clock was not working. However, he was forced to leave after Fronk successfully repaired the clock, and Frieda embraced him.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Frieda's voice actress April Winchell voiced three other characters in Timon & Pumbaa, which are [[Piper (Timon and Pumbaa)|Piper]], [[Madame Credenza]], and [[the Tigress]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nFrieda 1.png\nFrieda 2.png|Frieda and her husband, Fronk\nFrieda 3.png|Timon and Pumbaa confronting Frieda and Fronk\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Lion King}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Timon & Pumbaa characters]]\n[[Category:Swedish people]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]"
