She is a member of [[Fireside Girls]] in [[Danville]] Troop 46231.\n\n==Background==\n===Physical appearance===\nAdyson has straight dark brown hair with large bangs and a curve at the bottom. She has green eyes, rosy pink skin, and a red headband (which sometimes isn't seen in a few episodes). She wears a sleeveless uniform with a split in the collar and sides at the bottom, and high-top shoes, and in winter, a red shirt with a dent at the neck and long, bunchy sleeves, a longer brown skirt with an orange belt with yellow bow, black slip on shoes, and has an orange and red kerchief on her head in place of her hairband.\n==Relationships==\n===[[Isabella Garcia-Shapiro]]===\nAdyson is really good friends with [[Isabella Garcia-Shapiro|Isabella]]. She sang with [[Isabella Garcia-Shapiro|Isabella]] in the song [[S'Winter (song)|S'Winter]], along with [[Gretchen]]. She willingly took Isabella's place as the one in charge when she left with [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]] and [[Ferb Fletcher|Ferb]] to circumnavigate the world and helped her up on a plane when Clay Aiken sang (\"[[Phineas and Ferb Summer Belongs to You!]]\"). Later that summer, she was saved by Isabella when she was caught in a river and forced downstream. Also, Isabella helped her heal from her concussion. (\"[[The Great Indoors]]\")\n\n===The Other Fireside Girls===\nAlong with the other Fireside Girls, Adyson is often involved with [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]] and [[Ferb Fletcher|Ferb]]'s Big Ideas. In \"[[The Great Indoors]]\", Adyson was shown to be accident prone; getting heat/sun stroke in the desert biome, getting swept away by a raging river in the rainforest biome, and getting hit on the head with a rock in the mountain biome. In \"[[Isabella and the Temple of Sap]]\", Adyson was tethered to [[Gretchen]] as the latter was reading a book and calling out directions to the other girls.\n\n===[[Phineas Flynn]]===\nAdyson along with the other Fireside Girls, help out Phineas with him and [[Ferb Fletcher|his brother]]'s Big Ideas.\n\n===[[Ferb Fletcher]]===\nNot too much is known about the relationship because both of them rarely speak. Also, in \"[[The Great Indoors]]\", Ferb said to Adyson, \"Sorry, Adyson.\" when she received a concussion.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Adyson is one of the characters to be an ambidextrous sprite. When she turns her head, her bangs swoop to the other side. Sometimes, the other side of her head can be seen in a few episodes.\n*Her first cameo speaking line was in \"[[Tree to Get Ready]]\", while her first true speaking line occurred within \"[[Isabella and the Temple of Sap]]\", where she made a sarcastic comment on the \"Help Thy Neighbor\" patch.\n*Adyson is based on [[Jeff \"Swampy\" Marsh]]'s granddaughter.\n*She, along with [[Gretchen]], are the only Fireside Girls not to have a red collar at the neck.\n*Her surname was revealed in \"[[Fireside Girl Jamboree]]\". As of this episode, she's the only Fireside Girl besides [[Isabella]], [[Ginger Hirano|Ginger]], and [[Candace Flynn|Candace]] to have her surname revealed.\n\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"200\" spacing=\"small\">\nS'Winter.jpg|Adyson singing S'Winter with [[Isabella Garcia-Shapiro|Isabella]] and [[Gretchen]]\nFireside Girls in desert clothes.jpg|Adyson suffering heat stroke and being helped by [[Katie]] and [[Ginger Hirano]]\nAdyson and Milly armed with water balloons.jpg|Adyson and [[Milly]] armed with water balloons\nGitchee Gitchee Goo 2.jpG|Adyson in the extended version of [[Gitchee Gitchee Goo]] during [[Phineas and Ferb Musical Cliptastic Countdown]] (far right)\nAdyson Ride Again.JPG|Adyson in ''[[Phineas and Ferb Ride Again]]''\nAdysonFerbGretchen.jpg|Adyson with Ferb and Gretchen\nAdyson Climbing.jpg|Adyson climbing a mountain\nAdyson holding Baby Phineas.JPG|Adyson holding Phineas as a baby\nCake baking.jpg|Adyson baking a cake\nAdyson working on eggs.jpg|Adyson about to swat an egg\nAdyson launching water ballons.jpg|Adyson sling-shotting water balloons\nAll Fireside Girls in Ride Again.JPG|Adyson with the other Fireside Girls in Ride Again\nchar_45921.jpg|Adyson at the hideout\nAdyson Sweetwater.jpg|Adyson standing up\nGinger stop again.jpg|Adyson in Waggle Dance\nMilly's hair.png|Adyson entering the biodome\nTrojan boat.jpg|Adyson in the Trojan-style boat.\nScreen Shot 2015-03-14 at 10.49.08 PM.png|Adyson in [[Bee Story]]\nFireside Girls pyramid-NotLP.JPG|Adyson in the pyramid\nGretchen singing Jump Right In.JPG|Adyson singing back-up in [[Jump Right In]]\n</gallery>\n\n{{PF-Wiki}}\n{{Phineas and Ferb}}\n\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sweetwater, Adyson}}\n[[Category:Phineas and Ferb characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Scouts]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Circus performers]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Time travelers]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Deuteragonists]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Bees]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
