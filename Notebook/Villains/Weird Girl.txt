She is one of [[Victor Frankenstein]]'s classmates and is well known for her eerie gaze, and strange personality. She is 12-years-old.\n\n==Description==\nWeird Girl doesn\u2019t fit in well with the other kids. She delivers ominous pronouncements in a monotone voice with an unnerving stare. Her constant companion is her fluffy white cat [[Mr. Whiskers (Frankenweenie)|Mr. Whiskers]], whose unblinking gaze matches her own. The other kids give them a wide berth\u2014especially when Weird Girl rambles about Mr. Whiskers\u2019 dreams.\n\n== Appearances ==\n===''[[Frankenweenie]]''===\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"150\">\nTumblr n4klewHaik1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\nfrankenweenie weird girl.png\nweird-girl-and-mr-whiskers.jpg\nFRANK 09 12 12 holly-vampire.jpg\nWeirdGirl Frankenweenie.png\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*She bears a strong resemblance to Staring Girl.
