'''Experiment 103''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]]. He is designed to intercept and prevent pollination by attracting bees and other pollinators to himself instead of flowers. He was captured by [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]], but was rescued in \"[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]\".\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment 103 was the 103rd genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to prevent the pollination of flowers by attracting bees to himself. 103 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.\n\nAt an unknown point after this, Experiment 103 was activated and captured by [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]].\n\nIn \"[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]\", Stamen was freed along with [[Gantu]]'s other captive experiments by [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], and several other experiments in a rescue mission.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nThe first 624 experiments, including Stamen, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]] and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nIt is unknown whether or not Stamen participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]].\n\nThe Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Stamen was activated off-screen.\n*Stamen and [[Tickle-Tummy]] are the only experiments rescued in \"[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]\" that had never been seen or referenced before. [[Nosox]] had never been seen before, but was mentioned in \"[[Amnesio (episode)|Amnesio]]\" and seen in [[Experiment Pods|pod]] form in \"[[Drowsy (episode)|Drowsy]]\".\n*Stamen is one of the few experiments to not appear in the group photo at the end of ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nVlcsnap-2013-06-27-13h35m32s178.png\nVlcsnap-2013-03-23-14h37m23s239.png\nVlcsnap-2013-02-05-12h16m39s241.png\nVlcsnap-2013-02-09-20h08m40s179.png\nExperiements (Snafu).jpg\nVlcsnap-2013-07-17-21h01m19s222.png\nVlcsnap-2013-01-08-18h06m52s87.png\nVlcsnap-2013-07-15-22h39m34s215.png\nVlcsnap-2013-06-27-13h19m57s190.png\nVlcsnap-2013-02-05-12h44m30s29.png\nVlcsnap-2013-03-23-13h51m10s10.png\nVlcsnap-2013-07-06-15h23m16s162.png\nVlcsnap-2013-07-06-15h28m07s143.png\nVlcsnap-2013-01-16-17h52m52s132.png\nVlcsnap-2013-01-16-18h04m04s184.png\nVlcsnap-2013-01-16-17h39m04s2.png\nVlcsnap-2013-07-15-22h17m07s71.png\nVlcsnap-2013-12-28-20h22m40s189.png\nVlcsnap-2013-07-06-17h02m11s14.png\nVlcsnap-2013-02-09-19h54m50s54.png\nVlcsnap-2013-02-08-11h58m00s88.png\nPanes21.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
