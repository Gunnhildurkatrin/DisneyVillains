Although very wise, he is known to be very silly and playful at times. He can sometimes be an annoyance and appear to help at all, when in fact he actually does in his own strange way. His wisdom often doesn't make sense at the start, but it eventually becomes clear once his lessons have been learned.\n== Background ==\nGlossaryck has been the magical mentor for the queens of Mewni for centuries. He has appeared in every one of the queens' tapestries, showing his significance to the queendom. He is also the single most powerful being in the universe, and he created many other powerful beings, including [[Hekapoo]], [[Lekmet]], [[Omnitraxus Prime]], and [[Rhombulus]].\n\n=== Physical Appearance ===\nGlossaryck is a very small, blue man with a long white beard. He has an very long nose, six fingers on each hand, and a gem implanted on his forehead. He usually, though not always, wears a yellow-brown robe.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\">\nRaid the Cave concept 18.png\nRaid the Cave concept 17.png\nMewberty-17.jpg\nMewberty-19.png\nMy New Wand 14.jpg\nStar-On-Wheels-19.png\nInto-the-Wand-5.png\nThe-Battle-of-Mewni-25.png\nMeteora's Lesson 1.jpg\nMeteora's Lesson 2.jpg\nMeteora's Lesson 3.jpg\nMeteora's Lesson 5.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*{{Interwiki|https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/star-and-the-forces-of-evil/images/6/64/Favicon.ico|starvstheforcesofevil|Glossaryck|Star vs. the Forces of Evil Wiki}}\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Star vs. the Forces of Evil}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Mentors]]\n[[Category:Star vs. the Forces of Evil characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Immortal]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Those brought back to life]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Servants]]"
