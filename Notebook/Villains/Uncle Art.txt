An intergalactic pizza man, Art takes his job seriously to the point of taking on a superhero persona in his deliveries. He was voiced by late [[Adam West]], who portrayed the superhero Batman in the [[Wikipedia:Batman (1966 TV series)|1966\u20131968 TV series]] and [[Wikipedia:Batman (1966 film)|film adaptation]], which can be connected to why Uncle Art was first mistaken by Lewis to be a charismatic superhero.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Meet the Robinsons]]''===\nArt first appears in the film running past [[Bud Robinson|Bud]] and [[Lewis Robinson|Lewis]] to make another delivery in his ship, the Anchovy Saucer. He later appears at dinner, reminiscing over a delivery when the spaghetti arrives and participates in the battle against [[Tiny the T-Rex]], briefly bombarding the dinosaur with pizza dough before it re-emerges and bites into the ship, bringing it down.\n\n===[[Meet the Robinsons (video game)|''Meet the Robinsons'' (video game)]]===\nArt hangs out with his ship parked outside and enlists [[Wilbur Robinson|Wilbur]]'s help to round up some creatures called Zumzats, which stowed away on his ship during a delivery. Later, in the alternate timeline, Art stops to deliver a pizza to Emperor [[Stanley (Meet the Robinsons)|Stanley]], allowing Wilbur an opportunity to enter the fortress.\n\n== Trivia==\n\n*Art's last name was present in earlier drafts of the film before falling out of use in the final film.\n*Art off-handedly mentions his meatball pizza stopping a civil war on the Moon of Qward. Qward is a planet from the DC Comics universe primarily known as the headquarters of ''Green Lantern'' villain Sinestro.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nArtGame.jpg|Art in the video game\nArt1.JPG\nUncle-Art.jpg\n\n</gallery>\n\n{{Meet-the-Robinsons}}\n[[Category:Meet the Robinsons characters|Framagucci, Art]]\n[[Category:Characters|Framagucci, Art]]\n[[Category:Disney characters|Framagucci, Art]]\n[[Category:Males|Framagucci, Art]]\n[[Category:Heroes|Framagucci, Art]]\n[[Category:Uncles|Framagucci, Art]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]"
