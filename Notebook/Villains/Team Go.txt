They protect Go City and are occasionally shown on the Disney Channel television series ''[[Kim Possible]]''. It was never explicitly stated if they're the only superheroes in the Kim Possible universe, though this is a possibility. They appear together in two episodes in the series, one from Season 2 and one from Season 4. Hego also makes a solo appearance in Season 4.\n\nThe team consists of a group of siblings, whose names all consist of personal pronouns followed by the syllable \"go\": [[Hego]], [[Mego]], and twins both named [[Wego Twins|Wego]]. In the backstory of the characters, their sister [[Shego]] was formerly a superhero like them, but turned to villainy and is one of the principal villains on the series.\n\n==History==\nThough nothing is mentioned about their parents, all of the members of Team Go (Hego, Mego, Shego, and the Wego Twins) received their powers from a rainbow-colored comet that crashed into their tree-house when they were children. Since then, Team Go took on the responsibility of using their powers for the greater good. However, the team disbanded after Shego left to pursue a more villainous lifestyle but also because she was the one who kept the rest of her siblings in line and focused on the task at hand. Team Go first debuted in \"[[Go Team Go]]\" when an old arch enemy of Team Go named [[Aviarius]] appeared and stole the powers of Hego, Mego, and the Wego Twins.\n\nCoincidentally, [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim Possible]] and [[Ron Stoppable]] were in Go City at the Mucho Grande [[Bueno Nacho]] where the first member of Team Go, Hego, lost his powers. During the encounter, Hego's super strength was transferred to Kim. This triggered a series of events which led to the reformation of Team Go in an effort to save the Wego Twins who had been captured by Aviarius. After arriving at Aviarius' lair and bypassing his security measures, Team Go and Team Possible confronted Aviarius himself. He was able to steal Shego and Hego's powers (Hego's powers being in Kim) and turn the might of Team Go against the good guys. Despite this advantage, he is finally defeated and Team Go presumably disbands once again due to the departure of Shego with Dr. Drakken.\n\n==Members of Team Go==\n===Hego===\n{{Main|Hego}}\nHego appears to be the oldest of the Go Team and acts as its leader. His default 'Go' colors are black and blue. Hego's Go power is super strength. He has blue hair and eyes, but a normal skin tone and appears as very tall and muscular. Hego borrows heavily from the superhero stereotype in both appearance and personality. He often throws out witty banter lines like \"Looks like this bird is ready for his cage!\" Hego also has a habit of stating the obvious, for which Mego often berates him. Hego takes pride in what he does and is rather bossy, but he has a strong sense of justice and usually means well. His personality is so annoying however, that after five minutes with him, Ron states that he was beginning to see why Shego left.\n\nHego has an alter ego in the form of a [[Bueno Nacho]] restaurant manager. He wears the standard uniform and glasses while in this role, and his hair color changes to black. He treats his job there with the same enthusiasm and perfection as he does with his role as a superhero. Hego's relationship with his sister Shego is obviously strained, but he still cares for her unconditionally. He states that Shego \"may be a cranky smartmouth prone to excessive violence\" but still believes she's a hero deep down.\n\n===Mego===\n{{Main|Mego}}\nMego is another member of the Go Team, and assumed to be the second oldest of the 5 'Go' siblings. He appears as tall and lanky, with a purple skin tone, hair, and eyes. His 'glow' grants him the power to shrink, which he thinks is very useful although no one agrees with him. Mego, as his name suggests, is rather self centered, and has a large, easily offended ego. Whenever someone else is talking about something important, he tries to become the center of attention.\n\nIn terms of personality he shares some traits with Shego. He appears easily irritated, and has a habit of making sarcastic or cutting marks, usually towards Hego, whom he frequently calls a \"big dolt\". Although it should be noted he's not anywhere near as violent as Shego is. While his personality can make him appear mean and shallow he is still a good guy. His relationship with his sister also appears strained, but like Hego, he still seems to care for her.\n\n===Wego Twins===\n{{Main|Wego Twins}}\nThe Wego Twins are the youngest of the Go Team, and possibly an older and slightly more mature version of Kim Possible's brothers Jim and Tim. They are relatively short and have red hair and eyes. They share the red 'glow' which allows them to generate copies of themselves. They are rather optimistic and happy-go-lucky, and often complete each others sentences (another similarity they have with Kim's brothers). Their relationship with Shego isn't very clear, as she doesn't address either of them directly at any point in the episode.\n\n===Shego===\n{{Main|Shego}}\nShego was the only female member of Go Team until her departure. It seems she always had a temper, was always irritated with her brothers and had an increasing interest in evil. She apparently went to college and has a degree in child development. She is the hired sidekick to [[Dr. Drakken]]. Shego still wears her Go team outfit, which is green and black. Her \"go\" power enables her to produce destructive energy blasts, usually from her hands.\n\n==The Go Tower==\n[[File:Go Tower.jpg|thumb|250px]]\nThe '''Go Tower''' is a very \"superhero-like\" residence in which Go Team (all except Shego) live. The building is shaped like the word \"GO\", which appears to be a nod to the DC Comics's '''Teen Titans Titan's Tower'''.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Their names all begin with pronouns - Me, He, She, and We.\n*Go is the Japanese word for 5, which was the original number of team members. It could be another reason the team broke up, as their name didn't fit their number of members anymore.\n*In the German translation of Kim Possible, Mego and Shego are voiced by Andreas and Katrin Fr\u00f6hlich, real-life siblings.\n*Shego is the only member of Team Go who doesn't wear a mask. The only time she does wear a mask was in \"[[October 31st]]\".\n*The team is a form of 5 siblings.\n*Shego is the only member whose hair color doesn't match with her outfit or the color glow of her powers.\n*The team glows in colors that matches with their outfits.\n**Hego - blue\n**Mego - purple\n**Shego - green\n**Wego - red\n*The team's names represent their looks, personalities, and genders.\n**'''He'''go - boy\n**'''Me'''go - self-centered\n**'''She'''go - girl\n**'''We'''go - twins\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nGo Team Go (3).png|\"Go Team Go!\"\nTeam Go.PNG|The good old days revealed.\nComet.PNG|Multi-colored comet that gave super powers to Team Go.\nTeam Go's Aircraft.PNG|Team Go's Aircraft.\nTeamgo0.PNG\n20170712 152954.png\nThe Go Twins.png\nBlue Glow.png\nGo Team Go (2).png\nGo Team Go (1).png\nTwins.jpeg\nGo Team Go 35.jpeg\nHego and Mego.jpeg\nHego and Shego.jpg\nThe Go Siblings.jpg|Shego and her brothers in the same place.\nShego's and her Brothers.jpeg\nTeam Go group.jpg|One big happy family.\n6766.png\nDepressed.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Kim Possible}}\n[[Category:Kim Possible characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Superheroes]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Orphans]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
