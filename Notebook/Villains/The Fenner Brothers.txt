They promise to bring the papers she has to sign after Mardi Gras but later at night, at the La Bouff's party; wearing horse costumes, they inform her that she was outbid by a gentleman and that unless she can top his offer by Wednesday, she \"can kiss that place goodbye\". Tiana tries to object but they tell her that \"a woman of her background\" would have difficulties running a restaurant business despite complimenting her cooking. After Tiana turns into a frog and she, with [[Prince Naveen]], are being chased by [[Stella (The Princess and the Frog)|Stella]], they get a cake thrown on them, thus making them resemble clowns. \n\nAt the end of the movie, Tiana returns to the Fenner Brothers with her new husband, Naveen and alligator friend, [[Louis (The Princess and the Frog)|Louis]] and gives them the large sum of money needed for her to purchase the sugar mill. They were hesitant to accept it at first, but when Louis growled at them, scaring them very much, they finally surrendered and gave Tiana the key to the place.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Their appearances are based on the film's directors, [[John Musker]] and [[Ron Clements]]. Their names, in turn, are revealed in the end credits; Henry (short one) and Harvey (tall one).\n*Henry may be a bit more sympathetic than Harvey, as he seemed rather reluctant to tell Tiana about being outbid, while Harvey just thoughtlessly blurted it out.\n*Technically, the Fenners were a bit correct in the notion that Tiana wouldn't have been to run the restaurant by herself, as she just bought the building but she needed more money in order to pay the personnel and for taxes. However, thanks to Naveen's and possibly Charlotte's financial support (which the brothers probably didn't think about), Tiana was ultimately able to run the place successfully.\n*When they mention Tiana's background, they were likely referring to the fact that she came from a poor working family as well as lacking actual experience in running a business instead of her race.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nPrincess-and-the-frog-disneyscreencaps.com-1301.jpg\nIma.jpg\nUyu.jpg|The brothers warning Tiana that unless she can top a gentleman's full cash offer by Wednesday, she will have to give up her restaurant forever\nPrincess-and-the-frog-disneyscreencaps.com-2793.jpg|The Fenners being confronted by an angry Tiana due to how long it took her to save the money\n4k-princessfrog-animationscreencaps.com-4021.jpg|The Fenners saying someone of Tiana's \"background\" would have a hard time running a restaurant.\nPrincess-and-the-frog-disneyscreencaps.com-3571.jpg|The brothers get a cake splattered on them.\nPrincess-disneyscreencaps com-10365.jpg|The brothers getting the down payment from Tiana\nPrincess-disneyscreencaps com-10368.jpg|The brothers scared stiff of [[Louis (The Princess and the Frog)|Louis]]\nPrincess-disneyscreencaps com-10369.jpg|The brothers frightened by Louis\nPrincess-disneyscreencaps com-10370.jpg|The brothers scared to death of Louis\nPrincess-disneyscreencaps com-10371.jpg|The brothers accepting Tiana's down payment\nPrincess-disneyscreencaps com-10372.jpg|The brothers surrendering the key to Tiana's restaurant\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Princess and the Frog}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fenner Brothers, The}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:The Princess and the Frog characters]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]"
