In ''Old Yeller'', he was named Young Yeller and was a Labrador Retriever. However, in ''Savage Sam'', he was named that and was a Bluetick Coonhound, as he was in the book. It is currently unknown why this change happened, however in the book he was always a Bluetick Coonhound; he inherited his colors from his mother, Miss Prissy. He was never named Young Yeller in the book. \n* In the first film, his barks would later be reused in ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'' for the [[Dalmatian Puppies|puppies]] during the ending scene.\n* Also in the first film, his whimpering is really recycled sound effects from [[Lady]] from ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' when she was a puppy.\n* When he was fighting the pack of wolves his growls were recycled from his father in the first film.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nYoung Yeller - Puppy.jpg|Young Yeller as a puppy\nYoung Yeller - Adult.jpg|Young Yeller as an adult\nSam Snarling.jpg|Savage Sam not recognizing Travis\nMV5BMjA3MTU4OTgwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjQ1MjIyNw@@._V1_SX640_SY720_.jpg|Savage Sam with Beck\n</gallery>\n{{Old Yeller}}\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Old Yeller characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]"
