## Project overview

This is the final project in the course Social Graphs and Interactions, taught at DTU 2021. This Project is about the network of Marvel villains.  At the beginning of this project all villains from the Disney universe where included, but as time passed a decision was taken to only include the Marvel villains. The video below will give you a quick insight of project. Links to an explainer notebook and a Github repository can be found under the video.
