"[[File:Duchess_the_zebra.jpg|250px|right]]\n'''Duchess''' is a zebra in Disney's [[1960]] movie, ''[[Swiss Family Robinson]]''.\n\n==Role in the film==\nIn the film, Duchess was found stuck in a mud hole and was about to be food for some hyenas, cheetahs, and vultures until [[Fritz Robinson (Swiss Family Robinson)|Fritz]] came and scared them away. She was soon set free by Fritz, [[Ernst Robinson|Ernst]], and [[Roberta]], who rode her all the way back to the Robinson's [[Swiss Family Treehouse (Swiss Family Robinson)|treehouse]].\n\nOn the day of the Robinsons' new holiday, Duchess is one of the animals who participate in the race, with Roberta riding her again, along with [[Duke and Turk|Turk]] (ridden by Francis' monkey), [[Lightning (Swiss Family Robinson)|Lightning]] the mule (ridden by Fritz), [[Clementine (Swiss Family Robinson)|Clementine]] the ostrich (ridden by Ernst), and [[Rocky (Swiss Family Robinson)|Rocky]] the elephant (ridden by [[Francis Robinson|Francis]]). During the race, Duchess leads Roberta to the beach where Roberta spots the [[Pirates (Swiss Family Robinson)|pirates]] coming ashore to look for her since she was their former prisoner mistaken for a boy at first. When the pirates led by [[Kuala]] come ashore, Duchess can be seen running back and forth while being chased by the dogs who are probably trying to bring her back to the family.\n\nIn the end, after the pirates' deaths, and as Ernst travels to [[England]] with Roberta's grandfather, [[Captain Moreland]] to continue his education there, Duchess can be seen running away along with Clementine, [[Duke and Turk|Duke]], Turk, and Rocky as Francis tries to bring them back.\n\n==Notes==\n*According to [[Ken Annakin]], they gave the zebra an electric shock to get her to move in the mud, a practice that is now illegal in [[Hollywood]] movies.\n\n{{Swiss Family Robinson}}\n[[Category:Swiss Family Robinson characters]]\n[[Category:Zebras]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]"
