He is married to [[Wanda Raccoon]] and is the father of [[Pinch Raccoon|Pinch]] and [[Scootch Raccoon]]. He operates Lake Hoohaw's recycling boat and also helps people with household problems.\n==History==\nOf all of the members of the Raccoon Family, Walter is the one whose behavior is closest to that of a real raccoon. Raccoons are known to be mostly nocturnal and are known for their abilities when it comes to scavenging and foraging. Walter works the late evening to night shift and sleeps during the day. As such, he is often away from way home or sleeping when his kids are awake, but he does his best to be a good father to them. When he is working, Walter is usually seen wearing a pair of yellow overalls with a recycling symbol, along with a red cap and boots.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nWalter Racooon scream.png\nPinch's parents helping her.png\nsleepyhead.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{PB&J Otter}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Raccoon, Walter}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Raccoons]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Playhouse Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:PB&J Otter characters]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]"
