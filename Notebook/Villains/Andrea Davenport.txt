Social influencer, future disrupter, Brighton Middle School's official goodwill ambassador.|Andrea introducing herself to [[Molly McGee]]|First Day Frights}}\n'''Andrea Davenport''' is a minor antagonist who appears in the [[Disney Channel]] animated series, ''[[The Ghost and Molly McGee]]''. Her family owns a clothing store chain. \n\n==Background==\n===Personality and traits===\nAndrea is a top student at [[Molly McGee|Molly]]'s school, who is highly respected among her teachers and fellow students. She is very egotistical, and somewhat snotty and crude, but still remotely nice when it comes to newcomers. She despises anyone who mispronounces her name (\"An-drea\" instead of \"ON-drea\"), even if it is accidental, to the point of having the offenders mistreated and outcasted. Most of the school appears to be afraid of her, even the teachers.\n\nShe also works as a commercial actress for her family's business, Davenport's.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nAndrea is a young, fair-skinned girl of medium height with waist-length, blonde hair which she dyed her hair light blue and fades to purple, and has one blue streak, freckles under her eyes, brown eyebrows, and light brown eyes. She wears purple eyeshadow and has freckes under her eyes. Her attire consists a bright pink hoodie, a purple skirt held with a pink belt, maroon leggings, and white whine-heeled boots.\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*Andrea's surname is taken from Davenport, [[Iowa]], which is where producer Britta Reitman grew up.<ref>https://twitter.com/InevitablyBill/status/1444794908250976261</ref>\n*Early art development indicated that Andrea would wear green and have blond hair.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nFile:First Day Frights (3).jpg\nFile:First Day Frights (5).jpg|\"It's ON-drea.\"\nFile:First Day Frights (6).jpg|\"You said AN-drea.\"\nFile:First Day Frights (7).jpg\nFile:First Day Frights (8).jpg\nFile:First Day Frights (10).jpg\nFile:First Day Frights (12).jpg\nFile:First Day Frights (17).jpg\nFile:First Day Frights (18).jpg\nFile:First Day Frights (19).jpg\nFile:First Day Frights (20).jpg\nFile:First Day Frights (21).jpg\nFile:Hooray for Mollywood!
