She was [[Belle]]'s younger sister. She was cut because Linda Woolverton, after rewriting the film from scratch at Katzenberg's order, wanted to place more emphasis on Belle's loneliness.\n\n==Background==\nClarice loved her family very much and took any opportunity she could to assist them.\n\n==Role in [[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|the film]]==\nClarice is first seen in the alternate opening happily playing in the yard of [[Maurice|her father's]] mansion with he and Belle. When her [[Marguerite|Aunt Marguerite]] arrives, she is shown to be somewhat afraid of her and runs to hide between Maurice's legs. Later, after her family has moved into [[Belle's cottage|the cottage]], she, her father, and her sister enjoy a happy moment together dancing to the music played by her mother's former music box that has just become Belle's birthday gift. When tax collectors arrive and tell Maurice that he must either pay them the money he owes or lose the house as well as [[Philippe|Orson]], Clarice becomes upset and argues that they simply cannot take the horse. When Maurice has left to sell the music box and Marguerite invites [[Gaston]] to the house for tea, Clarice attempts to flatter him by serving him tea before her aunt shoos her out of the room so that he and Belle can talk privately. She is last seen on the night her father has failed to return asking her sister whether or not he has got lost in the storm.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nBelle Clarice.jpg|Clarice with [[Belle]]\nClarice Charley.jpg|Clarice with Charley\nClarice Marguerite (2).jpg|Clarice greeting her [[Marguerite|aunt]]\nClarice Belle Maurice.jpg|Clarice dances with [[Belle]] and [[Maurice|her father]] to her mother's music box\nClarice Marguerite.jpg|Clarice surprised at her [[Marguerite|aunt's]] attempt to butter up [[Gaston]]\nClarice serving tea.jpg|Clarice serving tea to [[Gaston]]\nClarice Belle Maurice (2).jpg\nClarice Sketch (6).jpg\nClarice Sketch (1).jpg\nClarice Sketch (2).jpg\nClarice Sketch (3).jpg\nClarice Sketch (4).jpg\nClarice Sketch (5).jpg\nGaston with Belle's Family.jpg|Clarice watches as [[Gaston]] proposes to [[Belle|her sister]]\nClarice Smiles.jpg|Trying not to giggle at the sight of [[Gaston]]\nClarice Worried.jpg|Asking [[Belle|her sister]] if [[Maurice]] got lost in the storm\nBelle Clarice (2).jpg|Clarice and [[Belle]] excited at the prospect of having a kitty when they meet Charley for the first time\nClarice Marguerite (3).jpg|Watching as Charley gets caught underneath [[Marguerite|her aunt's]] dress\nClarice Belle Charley.jpg|Clarice, [[Belle|her sister]] and Charley watch as [[Gaston]] leaves [[Belle's cottage|their cottage]] after having come over for tea\n</gallery>\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Clarice}}\n\n{{Beauty and the Beast}}\n[[Category:Deleted characters]]\n[[Category:Beauty and the Beast characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:French characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Servants]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
