In fact, he is secretly an ally of the fairy-folk, helping to protect their treasures, and working together with Beechwood Short.\n\n==Appearance==\nIn the film, Artemis was not home much at Fowl Manor, traveling a lot for his work. His son enjoyed the postcards he sent and kept them for his fairy collection, even though he did not know them to actually be real. One day, he disappeared while aboard his ship, the ''Fowl Star''. As the news was reported that he had been named a person of interest in a number of high-profile thefts, Artemis received a call from a mysterious stranger who told him \"I have your father. If you want to see him alive again, get me one ton of fairy gold''.''\" He hatched a plan to kidnap a fairy in order to the gold as a ransom, the fairy in question turning out to be [[Holly Short]].
