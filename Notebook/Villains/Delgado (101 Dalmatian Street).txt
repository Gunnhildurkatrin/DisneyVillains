He is one of the puppies of the Dalmatian family.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nDelgado is a very energetic and eager pup, capable of running at incredible speeds thanks to his doggie wheelchair which makes him the fastest of his siblings. He often darts about at high speeds and is shown to admire and look up to his older stepsister Dolly. He speaks very quickly and with a strong,\u00a0lighter pitched British accent. He sometimes likes to say car sound effects out loud when he runs.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nDelgado is a Dalmatian puppy with two spots on his left ear, two spots on his forehead and one black patch on his right ear. He also appears to have a notch in his left ear. He has only two visible front legs, with sock-like patterns similar to Dolly. He's missing his hind legs, but the joints are attached to a red dog wheelchair that is secured by his waist. He wears a black collar with a gold dog tag shaped like a yellow road line.\n\n==Appearances==\nDelgado first appeared in \"[[Boom Night]]\" in the background at the end of the episode, watching the fireworks with his siblings. He is also seen in \"[[Who The Dog Do You Think You Are?]]\", helping Diesel set up the Prince of Dalmatia portrait in the lounge.\n\nHis first speaking appearance was in \"[[May Contain Nuts]]\", where he did stunts at the skate park with his family watching. He later tried to impress Dolly by showing her he had mastered a rolling trick, but she was too focused on being with Sid and later hurt his feelings when she ditched him and refused for him to tag along after asking if he can come with her. He is later seen helping Dylan rescue Dolly from her fall from the church tower, getting excited by Dolly about to perform her parkour trick. He and Dolly then run about the house together after Dylan suggests they play \"PoodleWolf\" with him.\n\nIn \"[[Snow Day (101 Dalmatian Street)|Snow Day]]\", a rambunctious Delgado is seen zipping around upstairs when Doug is handing out winter hats to the pups and veers straight towards the stairs, flies into the air for a few seconds and then crashes down the stairs, \"bowling over\" his siblings, causing Deepak to swallow a glowing cat toy. He is seen lying face first on a stair with his hind wheelchair legs up in the air. He is later seen being chased by Dolly so she can put his hat on, with Delgado commenting he doesn't want to as the hats are itchy.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Delgado is voiced by Jack Binstead who, like Delgado, also uses a wheelchair.\n*This marks the second handicapped Dalmatian in the franchise, the first being [[Tripod]] in the 1997 Disney show ''[[101 Dalmatians: The Series]]''.\n*Delgado is similar to [[Lollie]] from ''[[Puppy Dog Pals]]'', because they both use a wheelchair.\n*He shares the same name with Delgado from Beverly Hills Chihuahua.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\">\nDelgado Model SheetsDL.png|Delgado Character Ref\nScreen Shot 2019-04-03 at 2.22.32 AM.png|Delgado's first appearance in \"Boom Night\"\nScreen Shot 2019-03-31 at 2.00.59 PM.png|Sad Delgado\nScreen Shot 2019-03-31 at 11.39.17 PM.png\nTumblr d430bd2261947c4757ec0d6d2c6b7be4 e9187ce1 1280 (1).jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{101 Dalmatians}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:101 Dalmatians characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters with disabilities]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:English characters]]"
