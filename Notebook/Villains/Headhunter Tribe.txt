They were known by the [[Jungle Navigation Company]] as being headhunters due to their practice of collecting the skulls of their enemies. The Umbala were enemies of the Jungle Navigation Company, attacking their boats, skippers and passengers while also being responsible for killing several other settlers and colonists.\n\n===Development history===\nDue to the racism embedded in the characters, the headhunters were removed in a [[2021]] refurbishment. Similarly, the skulls belonging to them were removed throughout [[Adventureland]] and largely replaced by tribal art. The tribe scene was removed by several chimpanzees riding the boat The Mekong Maiden in Disneyland and Kwango Kate in the Magic Kingdom. The tribe still appears in [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] and in [[Tokyo Disneyland]], however.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===[[A Pirate's Adventure: Treasures of the Seven Seas]]===\nThe headhunters are prominent characters in the mission, \"Heads, you lose\" in this interactive [[Pirates of the Caribbean]] game at the [[Magic Kingdom]]. Taking place in the 18th century, the headhunters are shown to have a disdain for pirates considering that they killed several of them and put their skulls on display with a sign reading, \"Pirates be warned!\". In the game, players act as part of [[Jack Sparrow]]'s crew to race with [[Captain Barbossa]] for the treasure of the pacific, a golden skull under the headhunter's possession.\n\n===The Jungle Cruise===\nThe tribe appears in the Nile River section of the attraction. They are first seen in their tribe as they partake in a ceremonial dance to the sound of drummers playing music. Nearby, a canoe full of skulls can be seen which the skipper states belonged to their last tour.\n\nAfter passing by this area, three headhunters disguised in leafs attack the boats with their spears only for the skipper to make an escape. Throughout the queue and load-area for the Jungle Cruise and other parts of Adventureland, skulls can be seen mounted which can be presumed to belong to victims of the Umbala.\n\n====Indiana Jones Summer of Hidden Mysteries====\nIn this overlay, the tribe members had the headdress of [[Mola Ram]] after it was supposedly left behind by [[Indiana Jones]].\n\n====[[Jingle Cruise]]====\nIn Disneyland's Jingle Cruise, the Umbala wore ugly-sweaters and danced to a victrola playing holiday music while their tribe was decorated with Christmas decor. The ambush was replaced by the warriors drinking holiday liquor and cheering on the passing boats in celebration of the holidays.\n\n====Jungle River Cruise====\nThe tribe warriors fire blowdart in this version of the attraction.\n\n==Other Appearances==\n\n===Film===\n\n====''[[Jungle Cruise (film)|Jungle Cruise]]''====\nThe Headhunter Tribe makes a form of cameo in this film, being white men in stereotypical warpaint hired by [[Frank Wolff]] as part of his charlatan Jungle Cruise. They use blow-darts to shoot at his passengers for fake thrills in his attraction. They are also partially adapted via Trader Sam's tribe the Puka Michuna, which Frank lies about being headhunting cannibals and who visually parallel the Umbala.\n\n==Trivia==\n*One of the attacking headhunters in the Jungle Cruise shouted out, \"I love disco!\" during the ambush of the boat.\n*Despite being identified as headhunters, headhunting is not a practice amongst African tribes.\n*In [[Disneyland]], one of the attacking headhunters was wearing a tribal mask made to resemble the face of [[Donald Duck]]. In [[Walt Disney World]], a similar mask marks the entrance to the attraction.\n\n==External links==\n*''[https://junglecruise.fandom.com/wiki/Headhunter_tribe Headhunter tribe]'' on ''[https://junglecruise.fandom.com/wiki/Jungle_Cruise_Wiki Jungle Cruise Wiki]''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\n4ab9447f491f-600x338.jpg\nJungle Cruise Movie Tribe.png|The, \"Natives\" in the film\n</gallery>\n{{Jungle Cruise}}\n{{Pirates of the Caribbean}}\n[[Category:Jungle Cruise characters]]\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:African characters]]\n[[Category:Pirates of the Caribbean characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Indiana Jones characters]]"
