At the age of 10, he experiences a frightening incident when he encounters sorcerer [[Balthazar Blake]] after wandering into the bizarre Arcana Cabana curio shop. He\u2019s given a dragon ring that comes to life on his finger, and he\u2019s told that he\u2019ll be a very important sorcerer himself. He then witnesses a furious battle between Balthazar and another sorcerer named [[Maxim Horvath]] which made him want to forget the whole matter. Until both Balthazar and Horvath re-enter his life 10 years later, forcing him to confront a destiny he would very much like to ignore!.\n\n===Personality===\nDave's actor, Baruchel, states that; \"Dave is his own worst enemy, the architect of his own misery. He spends his life trying to live down that moment in the Arcana Cabana when he first encountered Balthazar and Horvath. He gravitates towards physics, which is the discipline he gives his life to. When he meets up with Balthazar again, the sorcerer tells Dave that it was no coincidence that he drifted towards physics because although illusion and magic are different, magic and science are the same thing\". Some of this mainly refers his trauma that he struggles with since he accidentally humiliate himself when Balthazar and Horvath fight each other, in which Horvath accidentally wet the young Dave's pants, something that his peers laughed at. This is also something that he berates on Balthazar when they reunite on Chrysler Building, implying that he was traumatized so much to the point that only psychiatrists could help him get better.\n\nThough he can be a brave person when in the later fight against [[Morgana le Fay]] (especially after learning that Balthazar was feeling lonely for centuries and Horvath uses this against him by using a Disguise spell on a pedestrian that made her became Veronica's look-alike), Dave's actual personality are akin to nerdy, clumsy, and insecure college student lacking confidence and poise (though these traits became lessened as the movie progressed). He is also a bad liar, something that Balthazar likes.\n\n===Powers and Abilities===\n====Powers====\n*'''[[Magic]]:''' As a descendent of [[Merlin (The Sorcerer's Apprentice)|Merlin]], Dave is immensely powerful, unlike other sorcerers he can use his magic without a magic ring; Dave is the only one of Merlin's descendents to inherit his ancestor's powers.\n\n====Abilities====\n*'''High-Level Intellect/Skilled Tactician:''' Dave is highly intelligent. As a sorcerer and college student, Dave is a capable tactician.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Jay Baruchel stated that \"Dave is his own worst enemy, the architect of his own misery. He spends his life trying to live down that moment in the Arcana Cabana when he first encountered Balthazar and Horvath. He gravitates towards physics, which is the discipline he gives his life to. When he meets up with Balthazar again, the sorcerer tells Dave that it was no coincidence that he drifted towards physics because although illusion and magic are different, magic and science are the same thing.\", referring at destiny and past misfortune which Dave struggled with throughout the film.\n*Dave's character basis are the Apprentice from \"''The Sorcerer\u2019s Apprentice''\" poem by Goethe as well as Sorcerer Mickey in its ''Fantasia'' segment adaptation.\n**Dave's clumsy attempt to cut one of his animated mops into pieces is a direct homage to Fantasia's ''The Sorcerer\u2019s Apprentice'' segment where Sorcerer Mickey attempted to do the same thing albeit less successful owing to the former's clumsiness. The difference however, is the danger that they faced from inexperienced use of Cleaning Spell: Whereas Mickey came close to drowning, Dave  was nearly electrocuted as the flooded water ended up electrified by one of his electronic equipment.\n*It's implied Dave had experienced being bullied during his high school years as, when Drake Stone briefly threaten him while unveiling his status as a sorcerer (using telekinesis-enhanced strength to lift Dave up at men's bathroom and briefly left him hanging on the wall), he sighed with a reply, \"It's high-school all over again!\".\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nTSA LA Concept Art 2.jpg\nDaveandBecky-TSA.png\nDaveStutler-TSA.png\nDave-TSA.png\nsorcerers-apprentice-disneyscreencaps.com-4431.jpg|Dave becomes Balthazar's apprentice\nsorcerers-apprentice-disneyscreencaps.com-4501.jpg|\"These are old man shoes.\"\nsorcerers-apprentice-disneyscreencaps.com-4637.jpg|Trying to create a plasma ball\nsorcerers-apprentice-disneyscreencaps.com-4663.jpg|\"Ow!
