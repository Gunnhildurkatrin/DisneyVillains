When the elite Scout Fairies set out to capture him, Fawn becomes his only protection, as well prove that he is not what everyone thinks.\n\nIt is discovered that he's actually a mighty protector of Pixie Hollow who awakens once every thousand years by the passing of a green comet. The passing is followed by a giant green lightning storm that could destroy the fairies' homes or kill them. To prevent this; Gruff creates four towers, one in each season, to draw the lightning strikes to them. Then after he transforms, he flies around collecting the lightning and holding the energy until the storm has passed. It is shown that he can use the stored lightning to restore life to a dead fairy.\n\nOnce Gruff's mission is done, he returns to his den to sleep for another thousand years, until he is needed once more to protect Pixie Hollow.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink|Gruff}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Gruff's vocal grunts and growls are a combination of sounds from a cat, dog, llama, hyena, and a camel.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rc9RrQjBD2w</ref>\n*According to Fawn, Gruff appears to be a hybrid of ''Didelphis marsupialis'' and ''Bison occidentalis''. These are the scientific nomenclatures for the common opossum and an extinct species of bison.\n*The book about his legend was fragmented, so the truth about him was lost long ago. This was the reason the fairies believed he was a threat until he proved otherwise.\n*Gruff resembles the [[Bandersnatch]] from the [[2010]] film, ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Disney Fairies}}\n[[de:Nimmerbiest]]\n[[es:Gruff]]\n[[ru:\u0413\u0440\u0430\u0444]]\n[[Category:Disney Fairies characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Deuteragonists]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
