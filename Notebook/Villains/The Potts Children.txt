Like their brother, the children were transformed into a teacup set by the [[Enchantress]].\n\n==Appearances==\n===''Beauty and the Beast''===\nThey were first alluded to when Mrs. Potts was putting Chip into the cupboard for the night, despite his protests, shortly before Belle entered the kitchen after leaving [[Belle's Room|her room]] during the first night at the [[Beast's Castle|castle]]. Despite this, however, they were later awake and helping prepare Belle's meal (\"[[Be Our Guest]]\"). They aren't seen again until the climax of the film, where they aided Mrs. Potts in driving out the invading villagers by pouring hot tea onto a bald, mustachioed baker. They aren't seen again for the rest of the film, although they are implied to have regained their human form.\n\n===Disney Princess: Princesses and Puppies===\nIt is revealed that Mrs. Potts has a daughter.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nPrincesses-and-Puppies-disney-princess-38319627-500-386.jpg|One of Mrs. Potts' daughters\n</gallery>\n\n{{Beauty and the Beast}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Potts Children, The}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Beauty and the Beast characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]\n[[Category:Magical Objects]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
