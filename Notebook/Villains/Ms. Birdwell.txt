Plus, she has a rather strong British accent. She is very kind and helpful to her \"Chippers\", and would not let anything happen to them, especially to the point of not letting [[Kronk]] and his Chipmunks ruin their events. Other qualities she shows are order, determination, seriousness, and even knows how to reprimand someone ([[Tipo]]) when she needs to.\n\n===Physical appearance===\n{{Quote|She was a vision. Feet like a pair of landlocked tugboats. Knees like brass doorknobs. Elbows so rough, they could take the grain right off a 2x4. And her eyes. They say the eyes are the window to the soul. Hers were more like triple-locked steel-reinforced security doors with a combination I just had to crack. No doubt about it. She was the kinda girl you'd want to bring home to [[Papi (The Emperor's New Groove)|Papi]].|[[Kronk]]|Kronk's New Groove}}\nBirdwell has a round head with big dark eyes, a large nose, and a wide mouth. She has black hair that is tied in a bun and stays that way throughout the film. She is lean and tall, with thin arms, string legs, and very large feet. Clothing-wise, she wears a tan troop dress, an orange neckerchief around her neck, and an orange belt. She also wears a tan hat with orange trim.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Kronk's New Groove]]''===\nBirdwell is first seen in Kronk's flashback of Camp Chippamunka. Unlike Kronk, she is more into the competition than letting her \"Chippers\" have fun. While they were trying to get acquainted upon their first encounter, Kronk's Chippers unintentionally cause a stir, which angers Birdwell. She and Kronk then get into a fight and attempt to outdo each other in the preliminary competition. However, she gradually comes to adore him and later falls in love with him. They eventually spark a romance together and make raisin bread for their Chippers. However, when Tipo, one of Kronk's Chipmunks, pulls a prank to win the camp tournament and is caught by Birdwell, Kronk protects the boy at the cost of alienating his love. Back to the present, Tipo feels guilty, so he runs off to find Birdwell and tells her the truth. In the end, Kronk sees Birdwell again and finally wins her love, and she eventually marries him, as seen in the end credits.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The scene where Kronk and Birdwell eat dinner and first kiss\u00a0is a parody of the similar iconic scene from the Disney movie\u00a0''[[Lady and the Tramp]]''.\n*It is unknown what her ethnicity is; it could be that her name translates to Birdwell.\n**However, she shares the same name with a female panel, Miss Birdwell, in ''[[What's My Crime?]]'' from the [[1961]] animated film ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]''.\n**Some viewers can assume she is British because she was voiced by Tracey Ullman, who is British and voiced Ms. Birdwell with an English accent.\n*For some unknown reason, she does not appear in [[The Emperor's New School|the TV series]], nor is she mentioned.\u00a0\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nKronksnewgroove 07.jpg\nKronksnewgroove 381.jpg|Kronk and Ms. Birdwell's first kiss\nKronk's New Groove Cast.jpg\nKronks new groove 09 16knkys16 4ci.jpg\nKronks new groove 05 12kronk ks12b.jpg\nKronks-new-groove-disneyscreencaps.com-3871.jpg|Ms. Birdwell's big feet\nKronks-new-groove-disneyscreencaps.com-3942.jpg|Birdwell helps one of her scouts\nPapi138.png\nPapi142.png\nPapi143.png\nPapi144.png\nPapi145.png\nKronk & Birdwell (1).jpg\nKronk & Birdwell (2).jpg\nKronk & Birdwell (3).jpg\nKronk & Birdwell (6).jpg\nKronk & Birdwell (7).jpg\nBirdwellsad.jpg|A sad Birdypoo\nKronk & Birdwell (4).jpg|Kronk and Birdwell's marriage\nKronk & Birdwell (5).jpg|Wedding picture\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{The Emperor's New Groove}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Scouts]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Peruvian characters]]\n[[Category:The Emperor's New Groove characters]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Deuteragonists]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Coaches]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]\n[[Category:Native American characters]]"
