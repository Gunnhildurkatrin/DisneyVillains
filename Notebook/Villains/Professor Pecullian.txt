He is a fun magical Faun and the teacher in charge of the Majestic Hall class at the\u00a0[[Royal Preparatory Academy]].\n\n\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nProfessor Pecullian is a very smart, friendly, and fun faun. He understands the importance of books. However, he also understands the importance of learning from experience or as he puts it \"going out and doing.\"\n\n==Role in the Series==\nMr. P first appears in \"[[One for the Books]]\" when Flora brings the Majestic Hall students to his class. Mr. P devotes his first lesson to teach the students how to open their minds and learn by doing. To help them with the latter, he gives them a Mystery Gardening project: Raising Mystery Trees, magical trees that love what their owners love to the point where they thrive when the owners give what they love to them. The goal is to get their trees to grow fruit so they can make Magical Mystery Jam. Prince James is the first to get his tree to grow fruit when he gives it pudding due to it being his favorite food. Vivian gets hers to grow fruit by humming to it due to her love for music and Amber gets hers to grow fruit by complementing hers due to her infantile love of flattery. Sofia eventually gets hers to grow fruit by bringing it near the other trees due to her deep love for her friends. However, the bookish Prince Desmond struggles due to being used to learning from books and refuses to ask for help. When Desmond finally swallows his pride and asks Mr. P for help, Mr. P helps him realize that he thrives on books due to his love for books. After Desmond's finally grows fruit, Mr. P transports everyone to the Jamnasium to make Magical Mystery Jam with the fruit.\n\n==Trivia==\n*He is the second Faun to appear in the series, preceded by [[Winter (Sofia the First)|Winter]] in \"[[Winter's Gift]]\".\n\n{{Sofia the First}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pecullian, Professor}}\n[[Category:Schoolteachers]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Sofia the First characters]]\n[[Category:Fauns and Satyrs]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Professors]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]"
