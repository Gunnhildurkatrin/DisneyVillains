(short for '''Automatic Branch Engineer''') is an animatronic train conductor with a Jimmy Stewart-like voice created by [[Gremlin Prescott]] who looks after the [[Cartoon Wasteland|Wasteland's]] [[Train Tunnels|Train Tunnel]] Dioramas in ''[[Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two]]''.\n\nHe asks [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] and [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit|Oswald]] to help fix the three dioramas and\u00a0to repair the damage caused by the quake. The player receives a golden pin after repairing the dioramas, however, if the players damage any of the dioramas, A.B.E. will summon\u00a0[[Beetleworx]]\u00a0to attack them.\n\nHis exact origin is unknown, although it is believed that he is partially based on an animatronic\u00a0[[Abraham Lincoln]] from various American\u00a0Disney attractions, he also shares some similarities to other animatronic robot characters such as the [[Timekeeper]] and [[Tom Morrow]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nTRT Lighting 05.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Epic Mickey}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Epic Mickey characters]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Mechanics]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in video games]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Interactive Studios characters]]\n[[Category:Engineers]]"
