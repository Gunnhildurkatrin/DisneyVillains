Between this and Jose's ego running wild, tensions boil over and the macaw band breaks up.\n\nMichael additionally finds himself the target of those who would want to take a Tiki Bird home with them. Initially, the Randy family wants to buy him, but he flies away insisting he's not for sale. Later he is captured by Saoirse, a rich adventurous Irish girl who wants to bring a Tiki Bird home to her father as a gift to get him to notice her, thus giving him his Irish accent. After a chase and the island narrowly avoids a volcanic fate, she explains the full story and Michael considers going back to Ireland with her willingly but flies back immediately as she sets sail, as he merely wanted to set her on the path back home to reconnect with her father. The band comes back together and Saoirse eventually returns with her father for a proper vacation.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nRSCN7075.JPG|Michael with [[Jos\u00e9]], [[Fritz]] and [[Pierre]] in ''[[It's a Small World: The Animated Series]]''.\nTumblr oh2t9vkZw31riu867o2 1280.jpg|[[Disney Kingdoms: Enchanted Tiki Room]] Variant Cover featuring Michael\nTiki birds Card.jpg|Michael with Fritz, Pierre and Jos\u00e9 on a [[Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom]] Christmas promo card.\n</gallery>\n\n{{Enchanted Tiki Room}}\n{{Disney Kingdoms}}\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Parrots]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Irish characters]]\n[[Category:Kinect Disneyland Adventures characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Infinity characters]]\n[[Category:Enchanted Tiki Room characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Kingdoms characters]]\n[[Category:Tales from Adventureland characters]]\n[[Category:Spell Cards characters]]\n[[Category:Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom Characters]]"
