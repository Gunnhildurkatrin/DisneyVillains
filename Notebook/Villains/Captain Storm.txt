Storm manages to save them and earn their trust. Later, he tricks the three young ducks into finding spare parts for their damaged ship as an advantage to make them help retrieve his treasure while Kent and Donald (mostly) repair the ship. During the journey, Storm fakes an ankle injury in order to allow the young ducks to go into the skull cave and retrieve the \"spare parts.\"\n\nAfter the young ducks manage to defeat the serpent by making it swallow boulders and notice Storm coming inside the cave, they quickly see through Storm's deception, trickery, and true colors; revealing he is actually a pirate captain looking for his treasure he hid through impossible traps. Captain Storm makes off with his treasure in Kent's fixed ship while leaving the ducks to drown in the tide flowing inside the cave and the others stranded on the island.\n\nWhen Donald rescues his nephews, they go after Storm on a pirate ship (from the cave) and sink the stolen ship with cannon balls and Kent's tanning oil, thus, causing Storm to lose his treasure; much to Kent's dismay. Storm is then captured by the Ducks as they sail on the pirate ship with Donald commandeering it.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"180\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nCDon1.jpg\nCDon2.jpg\nCDon3.jpg\nCDon4.jpg\nCDon5.jpg|Captain Storm's Wanted poster\nCDon6.jpg\nCDon7.jpg|Captain Storm's defeat\n</gallery>\n\n{{Quack Pack}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Storm}}\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Captains]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Quack Pack characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]"
