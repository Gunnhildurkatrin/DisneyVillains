'''Experiment 031''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]]. He\u00a0is designed to run around around and pinch people. His one true place is with [[Mrs. Hasagawa]] as one of her \"cats\".\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment 031 was the 31st genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to pinch people.\u00a0031 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai. Against statistically unlikely (but not impossible) odds, several experiment pods landed in one location: [[Mrs. Hasagawa]]'s yard, 031's pod being one of them.\n\nAt an unknown point, [[Mrs. Hasagawa]] mistook 031's pod for an apricot and placed it in a colander for later consumption along with numerous other pods.\n\nAfter\u00a0[[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Stitch]] redecorated Mrs. Hasagawa's yard without her permission, she was less than thrilled with the results, but decided to\u00a0thank them for their work with the \"apricots.\"\u00a0The pods were then revealed, but before Lilo and Stitch could stop her,\u00a0she washed\u00a0them with a watering can, thus activating the experiments.\n\nAfter his activation, 031 began to follow his primary function by pinching Lilo and exclaiming, \"Got you!\" Lilo and Stitch believed the experiments to be a danger to Mrs. Hasagawa and, along with [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] and [[Pleakley]], decided to capture them all. Eventually, Stitch wrestled with 031, the former winning, and forcing the latter into a container.\n\n031 and the other experiments were about to be taken away, but were returned to Mrs. Hasagawa when Lilo and Stitch saw how much she cared for them. 031 was then named Gotchu.\n\nIn \"[[Woops (episode)|Woops]]\", Gotchu was oddly seen as one of the captive experiments in [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s [[Prison Asteroid K-37|prison cell]], although he is barely seen behind [[Fibber]], suggesting [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] caught Gotchu, but this was an error. Gotchu was then sent back to Gantu after [[Woops|Experiment 600]] caused mischief and nearly blew H\u00e4msterviel's cover to the [[UGF Troopers|prison guards]].\n\n===''[[The Origin of Stitch]]''===\nGotchu was one of the experiments that was gliding on the screen, but he is 586 instead of 031.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nThe first 624 experiments, including Gotchu, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]] and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nGotchu participated in the following battle between the experiments and the\u00a0[[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]] by chasing and pinching Leroys.\n\nHowever, the Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Gotchu was activated off-screen.\n*According to Mrs. Hasagawa, Gotchu has a special neck pillow.\n*In \"[[Woops (episode)|Woops]]\", Gotchu erroneously appeared with Gantu's other captive experiments, although he is barely seen, but he was already living with Mrs. Hasagawa, and Lilo and Stitch discovered him while Gantu was asleep.\n*Gotchu is one of the few experiments to not appear in the group photo at the end of ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nVlcsnap-2013-09-01-09h17m53s216.png\nscreenCapture 22.12.13 21-47-10.jpg\nGotchu running to Lilo.jpg\nscreenCapture 22.12.13 21-51-50.jpg\nGotchu pinches Lilo.jpg\nscreenCapture 22.12.13 21-53-24.jpg\nWrapper and Gotchu.jpg\nStitch struggling with Gotchu.jpg\nscreenCapture 24.12.13 23-01-37.jpg\nGotchu grabs Stitch's nose.jpg\nStitch and Gotchu fighting.jpg\nStitch shoves Gotchu in container.jpg\nscreenCapture 24.12.13 23-18-02.jpg\nVlcsnap-2013-02-08-11h58m00s88.png\nVlcsnap-2013-02-08-11h31m23s149.png\nVlcsnap-2013-02-08-12h06m06s200.png\nVlcsnap-2013-04-15-07h27m59s93.png\nVlcsnap-2013-03-30-20h17m07s98.png\nVlcsnap-2013-07-07-22h58m23s166.png\nVlcsnap-2013-03-30-20h26m41s17.png\nVlcsnap-2012-07-10-15h59m57s32.png\nvlcsnap-2013-07-05-16h02m58s17.png\nVlcsnap-2012-07-10-16h15m29s176.png\nThe Origin Of Stitch Gotchu.jpg|Misidentified as [[Tank (Lilo & Stitch)|Experiment 586]]\npanes10.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]"
