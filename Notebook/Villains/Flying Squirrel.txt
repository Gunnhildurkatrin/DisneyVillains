It is only after Donald cheats him and mistreats him that he is shown to be short tempered and cunning.\n\n==History==\nThe Squirrel is first seen collecting acorns to store in his tree when Donald comes along his cart of peanuts. The Squirrel goes to look at them longingly but the presence of Donald scares him away.\n\nDonald then makes a deal with the Squirrel asking him to help hang the sign up for him in exchange for a peanut. He agrees and afterwards Donald gives him a peanut.\n\nHowever the Squirrel finds out that Donald has cheated him when he finds the nuts inside the shell are black and have worn away to dust.\n\nHe complains to Donald that he wants a real peanut, but Donald refuses and throws him into the park fountain. After this the Squirrel tries many ways to get a peanut, but Donald constantly thwarts him.\n\nIn the end Donald loads a cannon full of popcorn and fires at him. The Squirrel returns fire by dropping pine cones on him and then stuffing a tree branch into the cannon. There is an almighty explosion that catapults Donald into the air. The Squirrel retrieves a peanut from Donald's pocket before the duck hits his peanut cart with a loud crash.\n\nHe then holds up the peanut in triumph.\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe flying squirrel bears a slight resemblance to [[Chip and Dale|Chip]].[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Squirrels]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
