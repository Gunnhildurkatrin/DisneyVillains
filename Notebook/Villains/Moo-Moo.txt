"[[File:Moomoolover01.jpg|thumb|250px]]\n'''Moo-Moo''' is Alma's stuffed cow from the [[Disney Junior]] show ''[[Doc McStuffins]]''. She is voiced by Collette Whitaker.\n\n==Role in the Series==\nShe appeared in the episode \"Blame It On The Rain\", when [[Alma]] accidentally left her outside in the rain and is then devastated. [[Doc McStuffins (character)|Doc]] takes Moo-Moo to the clinic to get her dried off. When Hallie puts a wristband on her, she cries because she is sad that Alma has left her out in the rain. Doc, [[Lambie]] and [[Stuffy]] twist and squeeze Moo-Moo, and then roll and press to cure her 'squishyitis'. Then they dry her in the sun and give her one last check-up and she is ready to go home, but she doesn't want to, because she thinks Alma left her out in the rain on purpose. Doc and her friends tell her that Alma still loves her even if she makes a mistake and about their previous mistakes. Aft singing a song about making mistakes, Doc and Moo-Moo hear Alma crying in her garden. Realizing that everyone, including best friends, make mistakes sometimes, Moo-Moo is ready to go back to Alma and receives one more cuddle from Lambie, Stuffy, and Hallie. Doc takes Moo-Moo to Alma's house and gives her back to Alma. When it starts to rain again, Alma takes Moo-Moo, her fairy doll and her frog inside.\n\n==Appearances==\n*\"[[Blame it on the Rain]]\" (first appearance)\n*\"[[Moo-Moo's Tutu Boo-Boo]]\"\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nMooMooDoc McStuffins01.png\nMooMooDoc McStuffins02.png\nMoo-moo being spun around.jpg\nDoc, alma, lambie and moo-moo.jpg\nLambie and moo-moo.jpg\nmoo-moo as she appears in doc's summertime clinic.jpg|Moo-Moo as she appears in the game Doc's Summertime Clinic\nDoc sings what's going on to moo moo .jpg\nMoo moo's ripped leg.jpg\nBallet at the clinic.jpg\nMoo moo dancing with the swans.jpg\nQueen of ballet song 2.jpg\nQueen of ballet song.jpg\nMoo moo in her ballet outfit.jpg\n</gallery>\n{{Doc McStuffins}}\n[[Category:Toys]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Doc McStuffins characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Cattle]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
