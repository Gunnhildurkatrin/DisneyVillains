Bobcat]] who appeared in the ''[[Bonkers]]'' episodes directed by Robert Taylor. He is a yellow bunny with detachable body parts (somewhat like [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]]), and as his name suggests, they tend to fall off easily. In the series, Fall-Apart worked as Bonkers' stunt double at Wackytoons Studios until his show was cancelled. He mostly appears in the Lucky episodes.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\">\nBonkers The Day the Toon Stood Still Screenshot 1.JPG\nBonkers The Day the Toon Stood Still Screenshot 2.JPG\nBonkers The Day the Toon Stood Still Screenshot 3.JPG\nBonkers The Day the Toon Stood Still Screenshot 4.JPG\nBonkers The Day the Toon Stood Still Screenshot 5.JPG\nBonkers The Day the Toon Stood Still Screenshot 6.JPG\nBonkers The Day the Toon Stood Still Screenshot 7.JPG\nBonkers The Day the Toon Stood Still Screenshot 8.JPG\nBonkers The Day the Toon Stood Still Screenshot 9.JPG\nBonkers The Day the Toon Stood Still Screenshot 10.JPG\nBonkers The Day the Toon Stood Still Screenshot 11.JPG\nBonkers The Day the Toon Stood Still Screenshot 12.JPG\nBonkers The Day the Toon Stood Still Screenshot 13.JPG\nBonkers The Day the Toon Stood Still Screenshot 14.JPG\nBonkers The Day the Toon Stood Still Screenshot 15.JPG\nBonkers The Day the Toon Stood Still Screenshot 16.JPG\nBonkers The Day the Toon Stood Still Screenshot 17.JPG\nBonkers The Day the Toon Stood Still Screenshot 18.JPG\nBonkers The Day the Toon Stood Still Screenshot 19.JPG\nBonkers The Day the Toon Stood Still Screenshot 20.JPG\nBonkers The Day the Toon Stood Still Screenshot 21.JPG\nBonkers The Day the Toon Stood Still Screenshot 22.JPG\nBonkers The Day the Toon Stood Still Screenshot 23.JPG\nBonkers The Day the Toon Stood Still Screenshot 24.JPG\nPiquellaughs1.jpg\nColor Me Piquel - Bonkers and Fall-Apart surprised.png\nPiquellaughs8.jpg\nPiquellaughs9.jpg\nPiquellaughs10.jpg\nPiquellaughs11.jpg\nFall-Apart meets Santa.jpg\nBonkersFallApartRabbit.jpg|Fall-Apart Rabbit with Bonkers and Lucky Piquel\nBonkers Concept Art - Size Comparison.jpg\nGoing bonkers.jpg\nBonkersvm.jpg\nBonkers (SNES) - Fall-Apart Rabbit.png\nBonkers (MD) - Fall-Apart Rabbit.jpg\n</gallery>\n==Trivia==\n*He bears a striking resemblance to\u00a0[[Roger Rabbit]].\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Bonkers}}\n[[Category:Rabbits]]\n[[Category:Bonkers characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Bonkers]]"
