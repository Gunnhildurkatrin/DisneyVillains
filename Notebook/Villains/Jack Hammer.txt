This giant robot, built by [[Willem Viceroy]], serves as the primary antagonist of the episode \"[[Weinerman Up]]\".\n\n==Description==\nJack Hammer was a robot that is too complex for Viceroy to control, so he installed it's control panel in the local arcade for fans of video games to play.\n\n==Role in the episode==\nJack Hammer was made to look like a tall, muscular man in overalls, steel-toed boots, and a hard hat. He wielded a sledgehammer that could convert into a jackhammer. Jack's internal mechanisms were so complex that they were installed in the control panel of an arcade game called ''Jack Hammer Hates [[Norrisville]]''. The game was made to represent the actual city, and whatever happened in-game happened in reality.\n\nCoincidentally, it was found by Howard, who was presently in a feud with Randy over who could win the most games. Randy was forced to go fight, and shocked to discover Jack Hammer was real with Howard controlling him, who thought it was all a game. Once [[Randy Cunningham]] was done, [[Howard Weinerman]] took up the controls. When Randy came face to face with the giant robot, he realized it was all a trap. Randy desperately tried to tell Howard the truth, but Howard disregarded it all as a way to distract him so he'd mess up.\n\nAs such, the city was being destroyed, with Jack Hammer being too big and powerful to stop. Randy tried to tell Howard, but thinking he was trying to trick him to win, but Howard didn't believe him and captured Randy.  Randy soon realized that letting Howard win was the only way to make Jack Hammer lose. Once Howard had beaten the score, Randy made a final request. Howard had Jack Hammer take a swan dive off the edge of a cliff. With the destruction of the robot, the game ceased to function. Breaking out. Randy realized the only way to stop him was to let Howard win, so he rolled with the blows until Howard got a big enough score to win. Afterwards. Howard had Jack Hammer jump off a cliff, destroying the robot. \n\nJack Hammer makes an appearance in the episode \"[[Escape from Scrap City]]\". He is no longer functional and has become the gate leading in and out of the arena.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nWeinermanUp - 154.jpg\nWeinermanUp_-_188.jpg\nWeinermanUp_-_202.jpg\nWeinermanUp_-_221.jpg\nWeinermanUp_-_250.jpg\nWeinermanUp_-_258.jpg\nWeinermanUp_-_298.jpg\nWeinermanUp_-_306.jpg\nWeinermanUp - 444.jpg\nWeinermanUp - 489.jpg\nWeinermanUp - 511.jpg\nJack Hammer Taunt.jpg\nJack_Hammer_Befuddle.jpg\nWeinermanUp_-_531.jpg\nWeinermanUp_-_532.jpg\nJack_Hammer_Copter_Kick.jpg\nWeinermanUp_-_537.jpg\nWeinermanUp_-_539.jpg\nWeinermanUp_-_541.jpg\nWeinermanUp - 575.jpg\nWeinermanUp - 578.jpg\nWeinermanUp - 616.jpg\nWeinermanUp - 617.jpg\nWeinermanUp - 618.jpg\nWeinermanUp_-_620.jpg\nWeinermanUp - 626.jpg\nWeinermanUp - 627.jpg\nWeinermanUp - 766.jpg\nWeinermanUp - 767.jpg\nWeinermanUp - 768.jpg\nWeinermanUp - 792.jpg\nJack Hammer Swan Dive.jpg\nWeinermanUp - 803.jpg|Jack Hammer's destruction\nScrap City Arena.png|Jack Hammer's cameo\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Randy Cunningham}}\n[[Category:Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja characters]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Machines]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Those destroyed]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
