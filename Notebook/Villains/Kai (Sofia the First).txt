He left his home in the North Forests of Wei-Ling so he could dance all he wants. He quickly became disillusioned due to having no one to dance for. He first appears while Princess Sofia, Prince Jin, and Wu-Chang are walking through the forest. Kai is happy to meet a princess and Wei-Ling's Crown Prince and Imperial Sorcerer and offers to do some dancing. Jin turns him down in favor of his sister. Kai walks away sadly prompting Sofia and Wu-Chang to tell him they have time for one dance. After the dance, Kai helps them on their journey by giving them Bamboost.
