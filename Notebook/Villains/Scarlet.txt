To the other Star Darlings, Scarlet seems to be on a completely different orbit, but that\u2019s just fine for this confident and independent starling. Scarlet\u2019s just not a warm, touchy-feely kind of girl, but she knows she needs to work on opening up to the other girls. Scarlet can\u2019t wait to visit Wishworld and let her inner light shine through!''\n===Personality===\nScarlet is confident, intense, passionate, magnetic, curious, rebellious, independent, and very brave. However, on the other hand, she is a loner and can alienate others by being secretive, arrogant, stubborn, sarcastic, and jealous. She is the drummer of the Star Darlings band.\n\n== Appearance ==\nScarlet\u2019s theme color is fuchsia. She is a teenage girl with tan skin, fuchsia eyes, lips, and fuchsia hair with black highlights styled in a short side cut. Her outfit consists of a fuchsia hoodie under a dark vest, a dark belt with a pink buckle, dark fuchsia ruffled skirt, black and fuchsia striped stockings, and dark boots. Her accessories are her star-charmed boot buckles.\n\nOn Earth, Scarlet\u2019s appearance changes to look like a normal human. Her hair color changes to black with only a streak of fuchsia. Her skin also loses its sparkle and her outfit changes to look more human. The only item that remains the same are her star-charmed boot buckles.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nDisney's Star Darlings - Scarlet - Profile Picture.jpg\nDisney's Star Darlings - Scarlet Discovers True Strength - Book Cover.jpg\nStar Darlings 01.jpeg\nStar Darlings 14.jpeg\n</gallery>\n==Trivia==\n* Scarlet is named after [[wikipedia:Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]] (\u264f), the eighth of the twelve astrological signs of the zodiac, which means the scorpion.\n\n{{Star Darlings}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Star Darlings characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
