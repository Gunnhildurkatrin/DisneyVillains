Later, after O'Malley offers the kittens some milk for them to drink, the Milkman unfortunately finally notices them on his rearview mirror, thus forcing to stop his truck yet again only a little more violent this time. As the truck comes to a stop, O'Malley accidentally \"flies\" towards the Milkman and ends up on his head. The Milkman tries to grab him but misses as he and the other cats try to escape him. As the cats are running away scared from him, the Milkman chases them away with a wrench and a bucket, which he throws at them but misses while insulting them and then continues driving his way. The Milkman isn't seen throughout the rest of the movie after this.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The Milkman's truck resembles [[Jasper and Horace's truck]] from the animated\u00a0''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians|101 Dalmatians]]''.\n*The Milkman also bears a strong resemblance to\u00a0[[Amos Slade]] from ''[[The Fox and the Hound]]''.\n**The milkman also bears some resemblance to [[Louie the Hot Dog Man]] from ''[[Oliver & Company]]''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-3702.jpg|The Milkman about to be frightened by [[Thomas O'Malley]]\naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-3705.jpg|The Milkman scared\naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-3706.jpg|\"Sacre...\nAristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-3707.jpg|... bleu!\"\naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-3715.jpg|The Milkman driving somewhat out of control\naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-3717.jpg|The Milkman stopping his truck\naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-3722.jpg|The Milkman getting out of his truck\nThearistocats-disneyscreencaps.com-3724.jpg|\"Sapristi!\"\naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-3726.jpg|\"[[Thomas O'Malley|Stupid cat]]!\"\naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-3728.jpg|\"Brainless lunatic!\"\naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-3730.jpg|The Milkman trying to fix his truck\naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-4258.jpg|The Milkman about to notice O'Malley and the cats in his truck\naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-4259.jpg|The Milkman noticing O'Malley and the cats in his truck with his rearview mirror\nAristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-4261.jpg|\"Sapristi!\"\naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-4262.jpg|The Milkman stopping the truck violently\naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-4267.jpg|The Milkman stopping the truck as O'Malley \"flies\" towards him\naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-4269.jpg|Frightened O'Malley on the Milkman's head while covering his eyes\naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-4271.jpg|The Milkman noticing O'Malley\naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-4273.jpg|The Milkman trying to grab O'Malley...\naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-4274.jpg|... but misses\naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-4275.jpg|The Milkman angry as O'Malley and the other cats are trying to escape him\naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-4282.jpg|The Milkman chasing O'Malley and the cats with a wrench\naristocats-disneyscreencaps.com-4283.jpg|The Milkman throws the wrench at them but misses.\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Aristocats}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Milkman, The}}\n[[Category:The Aristocats characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:French characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
