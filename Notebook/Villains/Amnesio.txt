'''Experiment 303''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]]. He\u00a0is designed to wipe people's memories. Luckily, Jumba programmed a password into him to reverse the amnesia process, though it must be spoken within earshot of him. He was captured by [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]], but was rescued in \"[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]\".\n\n==Background==\n===Physical appearance===\nAmnesio is a small, blue beetle/cicada-like experiment with a round body, two thick arms, two thick legs, a purple mark on his stomach, two large wings on his back with purple spots on them, a round face with large black eyes, a little mouth and two thin antennae.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nAmnesio can produce a red laser vision from his eyes that erases the memories of anyone hit in the eyes. If he hears the password ''\u02bbohana'', the memories of all his victims will be restored.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment 303 was the 303rd genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Jacques von H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to erase his victims' memories with a red laser vision from his eyes. 303 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.\n\n303's pod was used as a ping-pong ball by [[Keoni Jameson|Keoni]] and another player until it got whacked off the table and into a little boy's bucket of sand. Thinking the pod was a marble, the boy put it on top of his sand castle. A small wave then splashed over the castle, activating 303, which caused the boy to flee [[Lahui Beach|the beach]] in terror.\n\n303 then proceeded to erase people's memories, including a married couple whose wife clashed with her husband after losing her memory. Meanwhile, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Stitch]] handed out homemade invitations to the former's birthday party.\n\n[[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] later tracked 303 down, but found it quite difficult to subdue the latter while he was airborne, as he managed to successfully evade all of Gantu's plasma blasts.\n\nGantu and 303's presence caught the attention of Lilo and Stitch. Grabbing a butterfly net, Stitch climbed a telephone pole to try to nab 303 as the latter perched on a power line, but he was instead captured in a containment orb by Gantu. Lilo, Stitch, and Gantu were soon fighting over the captive experiment, which ended with 303 wiping all three of their memories, leaving the trio dazed.\n\nPlagued with amnesia, Lilo and Gantu decided to team up and figure out what to do with the captured experiment. Stitch, however, reverted to his original programming, while Lilo and Gantu assumed he was an escaped convict.\n\nWith their memories erased, Lilo and Gantu (dubbed Martha and Lenny) went after Stitch and did recreational activities together at some point. They later ran into [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] and [[Pleakley]], where 303 wiped both of their memories, but not before they explained to Lilo, Stitch, and Gantu exactly who was on whose team.\n\nLilo and Stitch then decided to team up to get their memories back. Gantu wanted to come along too, but Lilo was unsure of him upon hearing that he is actually an evil experiment hunter. After Lilo and Stitch discovered how to reverse 303's effects, Gantu set the experiment free. Lilo grew devastated, even though Gantu stated that he didn't want his memory back.\n\nLuckily, Stitch was able to use his binocular vision to locate 303, and the trio chased him into a factory. Despite Gantu's protests, Lilo undid 303's effects by shouting out, \"[[Pelekai \u02bbohana|''\u02bbOhana'']]!\" Although everyone got their memories back, Gantu managed to recapture 303 after a long pursuit and take off with him.\n\n303, named Amnesio, was successfully sent to an inpatient\u00a0[[Jacques von H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]], where the former ended up erasing H\u00e4msterviel's memory also. Gantu misleadingly described him as a dangerous criminal named \u201cDoofus\u201d who had just been captured by Ace Jackson (Gantu) while admiring a pottery jar that read \"World's Greatest Cop\", which Lilo had made Gantu earlier.\n\nIn \"[[Woops (episode)|Woops]]\", Amnesio\u00a0was sent back to Gantu\u00a0after [[Woops|Experiment 600]] caused mischief and nearly blew H\u00e4msterviel's cover to the\u00a0[[UGF Troopers|prison guards]].\n\nAmnesio\u00a0reappeared in \"[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]\", and was freed along with Gantu's other captive experiments by Lilo, Stitch, and several other experiments in a rescue mission.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nIn the film's opening, Amnesio can be seen waving hello to [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], along with [[Snooty]] and [[Babyfier]].\n\nLater, the first 624 experiments, including Amnesio, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium\u00a0to be destroyed. However, Lilo, [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]], and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nAmnesio participated in the following battle between the experiments and the\u00a0[[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]] by erasing Leroys' memories.\n\nHowever, the Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.\n\n===''[[Stitch!]]''===\nAmnesio made an appearance in the ''Stitch!'' anime where he used his powers on [[BooGoo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]], [[Reuben]], and [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]. It is revealed that Amnesio holds the stored memories in pouches under his wings. If his victims ingest the pouch with their memories in it,\u00a0everyone's memory will be fully restored. Only Amnesio knows whose pouch belongs to whom. Also, it is shown that when Amnesio's powers are used on Stitch, he reverts to his original programming since he is nothing but instinct in that state.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink|Amnesio}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Amnesio was first revealed in a DVD bonus feature of ''[[Stitch! The Movie]]'' in the experiment gallery.\n*Amnesio is not referred to by his new name at any point in [[Amnesio (episode)|his debut]], but his name officially appears on the experiment name list in ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''.\n*In his debut, when Amnesio flies around in several instances, the song \"{{WikipediaLink|Flight of the Bumblebee}}\" is heard playing.\n*The password which reverses Amnesio's mind-erasing effects is \"[[Pelekai \u02bbohana|''\u02bbohana'']]\", a [[Hawaii]]an word that Jumba did not know of until well after Amnesio's creation.\n**According to [[Jess Winfield]], \"Jumba obviously changed the password for Amnesio after arrival on Earth, when he learned about ''\u02bbohana''.\" Because \"it's always wise to change your passwords occasionally!\"<ref name=\"WinfieldTVTome\">{{cite web|title=L&S Says Mahalo|url=http://lasfansite.atspace.me/stuff/history/tvtome/page03.html|website={{WikipediaLink|TV.com|TV Tome}}|via=Yet Another Lilo & Stitch Fansite|accessdate=May 27, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319134719/http://lasfansite.atspace.me/stuff/history/tvtome/page03.html|dead-url=no|archivedate=March 19, 2016|date=December 14, 2004}}</ref>\n*Amnesio is the first experiment to be caught by Gantu onscreen; Gantu had previously caught a \"[[Nosox|sock hider]]\" and \"pudding stealer\".\n*Amnesio's\u00a0[[Experiment Pods|pod]] color is yellow.\n*The [[Experiment Pod Container]] describes Amnesio as: \"Experiment 303. Primary function: Erases memories.\"\n**It seems that Amnesio specifically erases memories of personal identity and relationships with others. Victims still retain other learned behaviors, such as language and societal norms.\n*Amnesio's head appears in the online game ''[[Jumba's Lab (Game)|Jumba's Lab]]''.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Bugs]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
