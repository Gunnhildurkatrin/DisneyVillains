One night, she hears barking and asks Towser what's going on with the gossip, but Towser tells her that it's not gossip. It is news from London saying that [[Dalmatian Puppies|fifteen puppies]] were stolen by Jasper and Horace; Lucy's confused by this, pointing out that there haven't been any puppies on their farm since a dog named Nellie's last litter, who're now all-grown-up. Towser decides to send the message to his friend, the [[Colonel]], down at the barn across the street to which Lucy points out that Towser won't be able to reach the Colonel at this hour, but Towser tells her that he will bark all night if he has to.\n\nAfter Towser is done barking, Lucy grabs his ear with her mouth in order for him to hear better, and he hears the Colonel barking from the barn saying that he wants the message, to which Lucy says to make it loud and clear, or the Colonel will never get it. When the Colonel gets the news about the puppies, he and [[Sergeant Tibbs]] the tabby cat decide to check out Hell Hall, formerly known as the Old DeVil Place, because Tibbs heard puppies barking over there. The Colonel gives Towser the word to stand by and when Towser gets the message, Lucy asks, \"What does he mean by that?\" Towser replies, \"Maybe the old boy's found something.\" Lucy says excitedly, \"Oh, I do hope so.\" Lucy isn't seen or even heard of throughout the rest of the film after this.\n\n===''[[101 Dalmatians: The Series]]''===\nLucy is the only goose in the vicinity of the [[Dearly Farm]], though she doesn't live there, as she lives in Hiccup Hole. Since Hiccup Hole is a public pond, Lucy often has to deal with people who arrive in order to go swimming, especially the Dearly Dalmatians, though Lucy reluctantly lets them continue to swim, despite the fact that she believes it impedes on her right to have peace and quiet. However, Lucy does require the Dalmatians to follow some rules, as if they misbehave or do something inappropriate in her eyes, she won\u2019t hesitate to go to Pongo and Perdita to let them know that one of their Dalmatians are misbehaving, so most of the Dalmatians usually respect Lucy's authority. While she doesn't have too many friends, Lucy enjoys hanging out with [[Cornelia]], as well as some of the other female animals in the Dearly Farm, where they often discuss the day\u2019s gossip. However, since Lucy doesn't truly live on the Dearly Farm, she isn't forced to follow many of the rules that [[Mayor Ed Pig]] forces everybody to follow, though since she often visits the farm to speak with her friends, the animals of the Dearly Farm generally consider her to be a part of their community. Lucy may not be the most enjoyable animal to associate with, though she is a good friend of the Dearly Farm and she strives to make Hiccup Hole the best place it can possibly be.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink|Lucy}}\n==Trivia==\n*She was voiced by Martha Wentworth, who also voiced Nanny in the film.\n*Lucy's comment about her and Towser's friend, Nellie, said something about her previous litter of puppies. It can be assumed that Nellie apparently had multiple litters of puppies.\n*Her name is a reference to the character \"Goosey Loosey\" in the book, \"Henny Penny\".\n\n{{101 Dalmatians}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Geese]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:101 Dalmatians characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]"
