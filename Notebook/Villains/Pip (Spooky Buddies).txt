He is a beagle pup who became a ghost.\n\n==Background==\n75 years ago, Pip was seen with his brothers and sisters waiting to see the [[Halloween Hound|Howlloween Hound]]. However, after realizing the truth, Pip refused to \"visit\" him, but was caught, anyway. Just as his soul was about to be consumed, the sun rose up, causing [[Warwick]] and the Howlloween Hound to escape. Pip's soul became separated and it made him a ghost. After being seen by the Sheriff Jim, he told Joseph and his dad to get out of there and had the place condemned. Pip tried to tell Joseph that he was still around, but a magic barrier caused him to remain trapped inside the manor anyway.\n\n==Role in the film==\n75 years later, when [[B-Dawg]] enters Warwick's manor, he calls Howlloween Hound three times. Pip tries to warn them but the Buddies get scared. B-Dawg thinks he is the Howlloween Hound and escapes him. After Warwick and the Howlloween Hound are released, Pip becomes free so he can warn the Buddies. Before he does so, a boy wearing a ghost costume gets scared by Pip, and he uses it as disguise so he could warn the Buddies. Pip tries to warn them, but the ghost costume slips off and the Buddies get frightened again.\n\nB-Dawg still thinks Pip is the Howlloween Hound, and they escape him. Even so, he still does not give up, so the Buddies go to [[Zelda (Spooky Buddies)|Zelda]]'s hideout. When Pip appears, the Buddies and Zelda get terrified, but he convinces them that he means no harm. The Howlloween Hound then appears, but he gets stuck because he's too big, and they escape him. They go\u00a0to see [[Deputy Sniffer]], but Pip and the Buddies accidentally scare him. The Howlloween Hound appears again, and Sniffer tells them that he can deal with him, but he\u00a0gets turned into stone.\n\nThe crew goes to the graveyard where Zelda attempts to bring Pip back into his body, but then Zelda gets turned into stone like Sniffer did, and Pip sees the Buddies get captured by the Howlloween Hound. Pip enters Warwick's manor, where he and the Buddies manage to reason with [[Hoot]] and tell him that he can reform. Hoot agrees and releases the Buddies, but then the Howlloween Hound sees that Hoot betrayed them, so he turns the owl into stone. Pip and the Buddies get trapped, but Pip bravely informs the Howlloween Hound that he sucked his siblings 75 years ago. The Howlloween Hound turns Pip into stone as well, but Skip and Rodney's rat forms help them all escape.\n\nAfter Joseph destroys the crystal, Pip turns back to flesh, and Sniffer, Zelda, Hoot, Pip and his siblings' souls return to their bodies, while Skip and Rodney are turned back into humans. Pip then returns to his owner and says goodbye to the Buddies before he and Joseph leave.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Pip's ghostly appearance and personality are a reference to\u00a0{{WikipediaLink|Casper the Friendly Ghost}}.\n*During the 75 years, Pip did not age whatsoever, nor did his siblings, Warwick, the Howlloween Hound, and Hoot.\n\n{{Air Bud}}\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Air Bud characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]\n[[Category:Those brought back to life]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Spirits]]"
