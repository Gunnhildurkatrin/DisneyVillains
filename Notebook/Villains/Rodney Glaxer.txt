Rodney attended Woxagon Elementary in X21, during the beginning of his elementary school years. During first grade, his preferred table of choice was with three other future jocks and he was already beginning his future role as a school bully. During this same year on the day when the new kid [[Lloyd Nebulon]] introduces himself, Rodney tripped him and made him fall onto [[Brittany Boviak]]'s finger painting, an act that humiliated him in front of the entire class except for [[Eddie Horton|Eddie]], [[Kurt Blobberts|Kurt]], and [[Douglas McNoggin|Douglas]]. He has since then become one of the biggest bullies, yet also one of the best jocks, at his school and would constantly pick on Douglas, Kurt, and other unpopular kids for the next six years.\n\n==Personality==\n\nRodney is an arrogant, rough-housing teenager who speaks before he acts. A respected Crater Worm jock, he is the quarterback of the Luna Vista Middle School Crush Ball team and, from the start of the series, is portrayed as the biggest bully at Lloyd's school. He often picks on those smaller and/or less popular than himself and sometimes humiliates them in front of the entire school. He primarily focuses on the nerds of his school, with Mendel being his favorite to pick on, though, in his first showing as a bully, he targets Kurt and Douglas. In spite of being the meanest bully of his class, Rodney is friends with many other socially-powerful students, such as other jocks and bullies, with at least six being shown to take his lead in bullying and mischief, including Jake, an orange alien who is also a fellow jock on the Crater Worm Crush Ball team, Marcus Xenon, a green, three-eyed, octopus-like alien of the same species as [[Eileen]], and Gina, a female alien of the same species as Rodney, who is possibly either a sibling or cousin of Rodney, though neither of these possibilities is certain. Rodney is also somewhat of a coward when faced with a real threat and will try to act cool while stuttering and shaking (in the case of Kurtlas for example). After being humiliated and defeated twice by Kurt and Douglas and even having to sign a document promising never to bully another student, Rodney did not truly learn from this experience as, in following appearances, he continued to pick on others, though towards Douglas and Kurt\u2019s group, his bullying would be more of verbal ridicule and humiliation.\n\n==Relationships==\n====Relatives====\n\n*Mr. Glaxer (Father)\n*Mrs. Glaxer (Mother)\n*Gina (Possible sister or cousin)\n\n==Episode Appearances==\n===Season One===\n*[[The Big 1-3]] (first non-speaking appearance)\n*[[Double Date]] (cameo)\n*[[Caution: Wormhole!]] (cameo)\n*[[Daydream Transceiver]] (cameo)\n*[[Campout on Zoltan III]]\n*[[Kurtlas the Symbiotic Boy]] (first speaking appearance)\n*[[Android Lloyd]] (cameo)\n*[[Nerd from Beyond the Stars]]\n===Season Two===\n*[[Girl from the Center of the Universe]] (cameo)\n*[[Nora's Big Date]] (cameo)\n*[[Lloyd Changes His Mind]] (cameo)\n*[[Francine's Power Trip]] (cameo)\n===Season Three===\n*[[Incident at Luna Vista]]\n*[[That's Debatable]]\n*[[Stink-O-Rama]] (cameo)\n*[[Love Beam Number 9]]\n*[[Neither Boy Nor Girl]] (cameo)\n*[[Cheery Theerlap, Lloyd]]\n===Season Four===\n*[[The Big Feud]] (cameo)\n*[[At Home with the Bolts]]\n*[[Heads Up, Blobberts!]]\n*[[Picture Perfect]]\n*[[Commander Lloyd]]\n*[[Day One]]\n*[[Go Crater Worms!]] (final appearance)\n\n==Quotes==\n*(To Lloyd and co.)\"Outta my way geeks, guy's gotta walk don't he?\"\n*(To Antonio) \"Uh...I don't follow...\"\n\n==Trivia==\n*Rodney is voiced by Warren Sroka<ref>http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/Lloyd-in-Space/Rodney/</ref>\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nRodney.png\nRodney_(Child).png\nCaution Wormhole (2).jpg\nCaution Wormhole (3).jpg\nCaution Wormhole (6).jpg\nCaution Wormhole (7).jpg\nAndroid Lloyd (1).jpg\nIncident at Luna Vista.jpg\nIncident at Luna Vista (1).jpg\nIncident at Luna Vista (2).jpg\nIncident at Luna Vista (3).jpg\nIncident at Luna Vista (4).jpg\nIncident at Luna Vista (10).jpg\nIncident at Luna Vista (12).jpg\nLove Beam (7).jpg\nHeads Up Blobberts!
