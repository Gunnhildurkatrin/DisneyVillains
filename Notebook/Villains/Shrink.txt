'''Experiment 001''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]]\u00a0and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]]. He is Jumba's first experiment created with [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]] and to be assigned a number. He is designed to shrink and/or enlarge objects. When he was created, Jumba and/or H\u00e4msterviel presumably christened him Shrink. After his creation, the press posted stuff about him in the papers, and it is said that the two scientists opened up a joke shop together and began working on Jumba's many other experiments.\n\n==Background==\n===Physical appearance===\nShrink is a small purple experiment with a white lower jaw and chest, three tentacle-like legs, two stubby little arms, and two floppy antennae with two rings. He has the ability to levitate in order to move around.\n\n===Special Abilities===\nShrink can emit\u00a0a green or pink ray from his eyes that will shrink an object or organism to a very small size. It has also been demonstrated that only the first zap shrinks the object;\u00a0the second restores its size;\u00a0and every other enlarges it. He is capable of levitation and/or flight.\n\n===Weaknesses===\nShrink seems to be simple-minded and can easily be manipulated and confused. He can be easily controlled by anyone holding on to his antennae.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series ]]''===\nExperiment 001 was the first genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to change the sizes of objects. He was apparently named Shrink by Jumba and/or H\u00e4msterviel before arriving on Eath. Eventaully, 001\u00a0and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.\n\nAt an unknown\u00a0point, Shrink was presumably activated, captured, and rehabilitated by [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Stitch]].\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nShrink appeared\u00a0in a newspaper clip on one of the walls of [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]]'s [[Jumba's Lab|lab]] along with several other pictures of Jumba and [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s early accomplishments. One clip showed a headline of \"Idiot Scientist Actually Creates Something!\" with H\u00e4msterviel's enlarged bottom in Jumba's face. Despite their past 25 years of partnership, Jumba refused to work for H\u00e4msterviel again when the latter offered, as he had been responsible for Jumba's arrest and imprisonment.\n\nLater, the first\u00a0624 experiments, including Shrink, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium\u00a0to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], Jumba, [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]] and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nIt is unknown whether or not Shrink participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]].\n\nThe Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.\n\n===''[[Stitch!]]''===\nShrink made an appearance in Season 2 of the ''Stitch!'' anime where he was sent by [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]] to mess with [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] and shrink [[Stitch]]. He manages to shrink Jumba, Stitch, and [[Tigerlily]]. It is also revealed that Shrink was abandoned at a young age and has a very willful and childlike behavior following an incident of being locked in a safe when he was younger. He shrinks objects using a green ray from his eyes and has the ability to levitate.\n\nShrink reappeared in a later episode along with [[Squeak]], [[Clip]], [[Nosox]], and [[Retro]]. After Stitch is reverted to his original programming by Retro, he goes on a rampage and ends up falling into a swimming pool along with Shrink's inactive pod. Shrink, seeing that Stitch is drowning, zaps him with his pink ray, causing Stitch to grow larger. Eventually, Stitch is turned to good again. Jumba arrives and asks why his experiments are running amok and mentions that Shrink may have been confused after being confined in his pod for a long time, before having Shrink restore Stitch back to his original size.\n\nShrink also appeared in the special ''Stitch and the Planet of Sand''.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Shrink originally debuted in ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''; however, he only appeared as a background character and technically was not seen moving until his appearance in ''[[Stitch!]]''.\n*Shrink is one of the\u00a0ten known experiments named by someone other than Lilo, the other\u00a0nine being [[Gigi]], [[Elastico]], [[Yaarp]], [[Hammerface]], [[Heat]], [[Thresher]], [[Plasmoid]], [[Morpholomew]], and [[Leroy]].\n*Shrink, Thresher, and [[Pix]] are the only known tripedal experiments.\n*He is technically the oldest of all the known experiments, having been\u00a0the first experiment ever created.\n*Shrink, [[Zap]], [[Remmy]], [[Cloudy]], and [[Welco]] are the only known experiments that are always seen levitating.\n**[[Phantasmo]] and [[Witch (Lilo & Stitch)|Witch]] primarily levitate\u00a0but often possess objects or living beings to move by other means. [[Tickle-Tummy]] is also able to levitate, but has been seen bouncing as well.\n*Shrink is one of the few experiments to not appear in the group photo at the end of ''Leroy & Stitch''.\n*Shrink's [[Experiment Pods|pod]] color is red in the ''Stitch!'' anime.\n*In Shrink's first appearance in the anime, his size ray is green, but in his second appearance, it is pink.\n*In the English dub of the anime episode \"Experiment-A-Palooza\", [[Squeak]] mentions that Shrink can shrink and enlarge things, and that both his and Shrink's names are misnomers.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nVlcsnap-2012-07-03-21h04m22s160.png\n001shrink.jpg\nvlcsnap-2012-08-02-20h56m43s41.png\nShrink circling Jumba.jpg\nJumba trying to swat away Shrink.jpg\nShrink flying.jpg\nJumba and Shrink.jpg\nShrink appears.jpg\nShrink's eyes glow.jpg\nShrink Green Ray.png|Shrink charging up his shrink ray\nShrink firing Green Ray.png|Shrink's green ray\nJumba being hit by Shrink's shrink ray.png|Shrink hitting [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with his green shrink ray\nShrink on a tree.jpg\nShrink watching Stitch and Tigerlily.jpg\nShrink coming in.jpg\nShrink zaps Tigerlily.jpg\nShrink falls asleep.jpg\nShrink shrunk Tigerlily.jpg\nShrink and Stitch.jpg\nShrinks zaps Stitch.jpg\nShrink flies past Jumba.jpg\nTigerlily on Shrink.jpg\nTigerlily on Shrink 2.jpg\nShrink eyes glow.jpg\nShrink zapping again.jpg\nShrink and Tigerlily.jpg\nShrink taking off.jpg\nShrinks flies up.jpg\nShrink and Boo Goo.jpg\nShrink enlarging BooGoo.jpg\nScreenCapture 08.02.13 13-44-24.jpg|Shrink's experiment pod\nscreenCapture 08.02.13 13-46-09.jpg|Shrink in the ''[[Stitch!]]'' anime\nscreenCapture 08.02.13 13-46-34.jpg|Shrink's pink ray\nscreenCapture 08.02.13 13-47-35.jpg\nscreenCapture 08.02.13 13-48-16.jpg\nscreenCapture 08.02.13 13-48-41.jpg\nScreenCapture 10.02.13 8-24-28.jpg\nScreenCapture 11.03.13 23-24-26.jpg\nScreenCapture 11.03.13 23-25-03.jpg\nscreenCapture 10.02.13 8-25-04.jpg\nscreenCapture 10.02.13 8-25-31.jpg\nScreenCapture 11.03.13 23-29-04.jpg\nScreenCapture 11.03.13 23-30-35.jpg\nScreenCapture 11.03.13 23-31-20.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]"
