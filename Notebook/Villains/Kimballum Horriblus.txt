Around 1492, it terrorized Spanish/Italian colonist [[Christopher Columbus|Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n]].  The only known documentation of the animal was performed by sailor and scientist [[Mary Oceaneer|Captain Mary Oceaneer]] on a map created for the ''[[Society of Explorers and Adventurers]]''.\n\n=== Development history ===\nThe sea serpent originally appeared in the attraction World of Motion where it terrorized a depiction of Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n.  The creature's figure was later moved to the queue of the Hollywood Studios Backlot in [[Disney California Adventure|Disney's California Adventure]] along with other props from World of Motion.  Eventually, this figure was dismantled and removed.  The appointed name of Kimballum Horriblus was created for the [[Skipper Canteen]], being a tribute to imagineer [[Ward Kimball]] who worked on World of Motion.\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n=== Hollywood Studios Backlot ===\nThe sea serpent previously appeared in the queue for this attraction.\n\n=== [[It's a Small World]] ===\nA toy-like depiction of the serpent appears in [[Disneyland Paris]]' ''It's a Small World''.  Here, the serpent mimics the vignette from World of Motion by staring down a sailor doll in a rowboat.\n\n=== Skipper Canteen ===\nAn illustration of the sea-serpent appears on a map in the S.E.A. meeting room, created by Mary Oceaneer.\n\n=== World of Motion ===\nThe sea serpent first appeared in this attraction, staring down a depiction of Cristobal Colon.\n\n== Trivia ==\n\n* Also featured on Mary Oceaneer's map of the Mediterranean is a depiction of the [[Nautilus]] being sunk by a [[Giant Squid (20,000 Leagues Under the Sea)|Giant Squid]].  Also on this map is what appears to be an illustration of the [[Leviathan]] from ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]''.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Drawing-on-inspiration-festival-of-the-arts-4-2006708-1200x900.jpg|Honor the Park's past in \"Drawing on Inspiration\", as part of the \"Taste of EPCOT International Festival of the Arts 2021\"\nFile:P78.png\nFile:1982-11-03-World-of-MOtion-in-Epcot-Scan1638-Lynne.jpg\nFile:ImagesCAOZ0T9N.jpg\nFile:Epcot-experience-attraction-poster-world-of-motion-1.jpg\nFile:EwjdHeLXEAUQ3LU.png|An illustration of the serpent in the Skipper Canteen\n</gallery>{{Society of Explorers and Adventurers}}\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Reptiles]]\n[[Category:Sea Monsters]]\n[[Category:It's a Small World]]\n[[Category:S.E.A. characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
