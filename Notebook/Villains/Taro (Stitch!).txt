He is Yuna's other friend besides [[Sasha (Stitch!)|Sae/Sasha]].\n\n==History==\nHe often has trouble keeping up with his studies at school, especially martial arts. In the episode \"Reuben's Rice Balls\", Taro is shown to not like eating healthy food, which would give him the needed strength to win a karate competition. However, when [[Reuben]] drops by for a visit, he makes rice balls with secret food in it so Taro can win the competition. Taro discovers he likes the rice balls, and successfully wins as a result. When Taro later finds out what the rice balls really contain, it doesn't faze him at all and he even asks for more.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the episode \"Stitch\u00a0Sings!\", Taro has been shown blushing around [[Yuna Kamihara|Yuna]] upon asking her to sing with him in Izayoi Island's singing contest. It is unknown if this is just him being overtly shy or if this hints a secret crush, though it is up to speculation.\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Martial Artists]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Japanese characters]]"
