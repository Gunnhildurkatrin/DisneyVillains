"[[File:Salesman.jpg|thumb|250px]]\nThe '''Salesman''' is the owner of rather scary books who only appeared in the [[1945]] animated short, ''[[Duck Pimples]]''.\n\n==Role in the short==\nDonald has a scary and unpleasant evening, until a shady-looking book Salesman appears at his door. Soon after, he disappears, leaving him with a collection of \"whodunnit?\" novels. He is not seen again after this scene.\n\n==Other Appearances==\nThe Salesman also appears in ''[[Mickey's 60th Birthday]]'', where he arrives at Donald's house, to arrest him on the charge of abducting [[Mickey Mouse]], who is under a spell, so others do not recognize him, until he finds his own magic.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nSalesman Horror Books.png\n39907.jpg\n1945-pimples-5.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]"
