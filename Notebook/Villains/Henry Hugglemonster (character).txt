Whenever there is a problem, Henry is always there to solve it. He might also point out to someone how someone else feels.\n\nHenry likes to roar, and his roar is what makes him \"Henry Hugglemonster\".\n\nWhen things go wrong and Henry is under pressure or cannot think straight with many noises, he needs a \"Hugglebreak\" which he flies up, clears his head and flies down to make things right.\n\nWhen there is someone who is sad or upset, Henry will cheer them up to make them feel better.\n\nHenry has a standard catchphrase he uses called, \"Roarsome\", when he finds something exciting.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nHenry is a small and slender yellow Hugglemonster with blue eyes, a red nose, blue-and-green striped horns with blue bobbles, blue and green spikes on his head, a blue-and-green striped belly and blue wings. He is 2 years younger than his brother, Cobby Hugglemonster (aged 8), and 1 year younger than his sister, Summer Hugglemonster (aged 7). He is around six years old.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Henry always says \"Roarsome\", and he knows he says it a lot.\n*Henry, along with his brother Cobby, are Monster Scouts.\n*Henry received a badge and trophy for winning the Roaring Racers.\n*He once lost his first baby fang which made him whistle instead of roaring, which everyone found amusing.\n*He hates slurpberries.\n*Henry mostly flies throughout the show.\n*He is six years old. The evidence is a promo where he says, \"I'm practically six. Which is totally almost seven.\"\n*His middle name is revealed to be Alfonzo.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nHenry Hugglemonster family photo.jpg\nHenry Hugglemonster01.jpg\nHenry Hugglemonster02.jpg\nHenry Hugglemonster03.jpg\nHenry Hugglemonster04.jpg\nHenry Hugglemonster05.jpg\nHenry Hugglemonster06.png\nHenry_and_Fuzzlebirds.png\nHenry Hugglemonster07.jpg\nHenry Hugglemonster08.jpg\nHenry Hugglemonster09.jpg\nHenry Hugglemonster10.jpg\nHenry Hugglemonster11.jpg\nHenry Hugglemonster12.jpg\nFang_Monster.png\nMost_Roarsome_Day_Ever.png\nHenry Hugglemonster13.png\nHenry Hugglemonster14.jpg\nHenry Hugglemonster15.jpg\nHenry Hugglemonster16.jpg\nHenry Hugglemonster17.jpg\nHenry Hugglemonster18.jpg\nHenry Hugglemonster19.jpg\nSummer stunned.png\nHenry Hugglemonster20.jpg\nHenry Hugglemonster21.jpg\nArts_and_crafts_sleepover.jpg\nMake_Your_Own_Fun.png\nHenry Hugglemonster23.png\nHenry Hugglemonster24.png\nHenry Hugglemonster25.jpg\nHenry Hugglemonster26.jpg\nHenry Hugglemonster27.jpg\nHenry Hugglemonster28.png\nHenry& Summer Hugglemonster.jpg\nHenry& Summer Hugglemonster02.jpg\nHenry& Summer Hugglemonster03.jpg\nHenryHugglemonsterPoster_FamilyPose_resized_800_400_c1.jpg\nAbominable Snowball.jpg\nHenry and the Mayor.jpg\nHenry rescue monster-bird.png\n</gallery>\n\n==Relationships==\n{{Relationshipslink}}\n{{Henry Hugglemonster}}\n\n[[ro:Henry Hugglemonster]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Henry Hugglemonster characters]]\n[[Category:Scouts]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Cousins]]\n[[Category:Nephews]]"
