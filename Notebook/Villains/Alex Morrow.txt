Alex has a challenging time supporting her son and working at a local law firm, but finds herself thrust into a new challenge when she agrees to assist Evan with the formation of his own ice hockey team at school.\n\n==Background==\n===Early History===\nLittle is known about Alex's early history, other than the fact that she was previously a dancer on the ice during her high school years. Alex was a talented dancer and later revives her dancing career in front of [[Gordon Bombay]] following the formation of the Don't Bothers.\n\n===Forming the Don't Bothers===\nFollowing her son, [[Evan Morrow]], being cut from the Mighty Ducks hockey team, Alex decides to form a new team in which her son will be the captain of. She tells Evan of her idea and he agrees, but the two find themselves at odds when they are eventually able to find participants, but are unable to win a game. Whilst Alex tries to tell Evan that they are only having fun, and that the outcome of their matches doesn't matter, Evan remarks that they cannot be losers and the outcome does matter to the team. Nonetheless, Alex continues to coach the team, striving to improve as a coach at every opportunity. \n\nAlex eventually succeeds in securing a place for the Don't Bothers to train at the Ice Palace after bribing the owner, [[Gordon Bombay]] with unallocated funds from the sports budget. She finds that the training grounds are adequate, but that she doesn't have the skills to progress the team any further in their training. Alex turns to Gordon numerous times for aid in their training, but Gordon rebukes her. Eventually, she researches Gordon and finds out about him being banned from practicing hockey professionally again. Despite this, she is able to convince him in to helping them with their training. \n\nAlex finds her position as coach of the Don't Bothers puts her at odds with her employer, Stephanie, given she is a parent to two of the members of the Mighty Ducks. This causes conflict between the two, especially when Alex is convinced to partake in the slapshot challenge wherein Stephanie holds the record. Stephanie initially beats Alex at the challenge, but after coaching from Gordon, Alex is able to beat her top speed by 1mph, angering Stephanie.<ref>''[[Hockey Moms]]''</ref>\n\n===Problems with the Don't Bothers===\nAfter the Don't Bothers begin to win their games, Alex becomes obsessed with winning, and pushes the Don't Bothers at every opportunity to win. When she learns about the state championships, Alex introduces a strict training and diet regime into the Don't Bother's schedule. [[Evan Morrow|Evan]] and other members of the team become disheartened at the behaviour, citing that they are no longer having fun; Alex's strive to win has overshadowed their fun. \n\nWith this, Evan has no other option but to fire Alex as coach of the team, passing the baton to [[Gordon Bombay|Coach Bombay]]. Nonetheless, when the Don't Bothers are nearly thrown out of the championships due to Bombay's history, Alex steps in, remarking that the Don't Bothers should still be able to play given the ruling doesn't apply to the team \u2014 they do not follow the rules because they were never officially scouted. \n\nAlex rejoins the team as a coach alongside [[Gordon Bombay|Coach Bombay]], and takes the team all the way to the finale. Whilst the Don't Bothers are disqualified by default by refusing to play due to an injury to [[Sofi Hanson-Bhatt|Sofi]] putting them below the requirements of ten available players, Alex challenges the Ducks to a private game at the Ice Palace to decide their fate. The Don't Bothers win the game and are able to take back the name \"Mighty Ducks\". Alex decides to go back to law school and finish her degree.\n\n==Trivia==\n*She works as a paralegal at a local law firm, but finds herself being used by the other members of staff at the firm.\n*Alex is similar to [[Casey Conway]], [[Charlie Conway|Charlie]]'s mother, as they are both parents who are concerned and care for their children and are both single parents.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nThe Mighty Ducks Game Changers - Poster.jpeg\nThe Mighty Ducks Game Changers - Alex Morrow.jpeg\nGame On Promotional Photos 1.jpeg\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Mighty Ducks}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:The Mighty Ducks characters]]\n[[Category:Coaches]]"
