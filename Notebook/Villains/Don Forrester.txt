"[[File:Don Forrester.png|thumb]]\n'''Don Forrester''' is a minor character in ''[[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids]]''. He is the brother, cousin, or husband of [[Gloria Forrester]].\n\nWhen the Forresters arrive, he mentions something about a cat (\"You brought the dog. I don't want to hear any more about the cat.\"). He then pretends to \"fish\" [[Russ Thompson, Sr.]] down from the foundation and they give each other high fives. When he and Russ talk, Don doesn't seem interested in what Gloria witnessed: [[Wayne Szalinski|Wayne]] flying. He is dismayed when Russ says that plumbing was keeping the Thompsons from going on their fishing/camping trip despite a non-refundable $80 deposit, but they part.\n\nEventually, however, when leaving, Don strangely does see Wayne flying.\n\n{{Honey, I Shrunk the Kids}}\n[[Category:Honey, I Shrunk the Kids characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
