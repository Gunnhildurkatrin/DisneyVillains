She is [[Cedric the Sorcerer|Cedric]]'s older sister and a sorceress, able to cast spells like the rest of her family members.\n\n==Role in the Series==\nCordelia is first mentioned in ''[[The Curse of Princess Ivy]]'' when Cedric was telling [[Princess Amber|Amber]] why [[Sofia the First (character)|Sofia]] was so angry and disgusted with her about [[Princess Ivy]]'s summoning. According to Cedric, she would steal her brother's stuff all the time and he's never gotten over it.\n\nCordelia appeared in \"[[Gone with the Wand]]\" along with her daughter, [[Calista]]. She wears a brightly colored outfit and seems to enjoy luxurious magical beauty treatments. She doesn't really listen to her brother and never lets him get a word in edgewise.\n\nWhile she is a bit of a kleptomaniac like her daughter, the two generally mean well and are considered to be good people.\n\nShe returns in the episode, \"[[Through the Looking Back Glass]]\" with her daughter Calista. It soon becomes clear she believes her younger brother can't do anything right with magic and that anything he touches will end in disaster. This was due to an incident that happened at her Sorceress Ball where she lost her hair and told her brother he had bungled the smokescreen spell.\n\nWhen her fighting with Cedric caused a magical calamity that caused the castle to shrink, she again accused her brother of bungling another spell, even though the problem started with her. When Sofia and Calista showed her what really happened at the Sorceress Ball, Cordelia realized it was her fault that the spell went wrong and that her brother did indeed have a great talent with magic and allowed him to fix her mess.\n\nLater when King Roland appeared to demanded what Cedric did she admitted it was her at fault and that people shouldn't automatically blame her brother when things go wrong. After Cedric restores her beautiful hair, she joins her brother as they head outside to help Sofia with her homework, close friends, and siblings again once more.\n\nIn the episode, \"[[Too Cute to Spook]]\" Cordelia and Calista are heading to a party thrown by Cordelia's friend, Muldo the Magnificent. However, Calista wants to go Trick or Treating with Sofia, as Halloween is her favorite holiday.\n\nCordelia reveals she reads the \"Ghastly Guide to Halloween\" to Calista every night. She agrees to let her daughter go Trick or Treating with Sofia, before heading off to what Calista called, \"the boring grown-up party.\"\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\">\nGone-with-the-Wand-26.png\nGone-with-the-Wand-54.png\nGone-with-the-Wand-56.png\nThrough The Looking Back Glass 5.png|Cordelia as a child\nThrough The Looking Back Glass 1.png\nThrough The Looking Back Glass 6.png\nThrough The Looking Back Glass 13.png|Cordelia's ruined hair\nThrough The Looking Back Glass 14.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Sofia the First}}\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Sofia the First characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Sorceresses]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]"
