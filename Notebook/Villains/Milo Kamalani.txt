He is the laid back and philosophical best friend of [[Pepper Ann Pearson]] and [[Nicky Little]] and attends [[Hazelnut Middle School]] with them.\n\n==Background==\nMilo Kamalani is a boy of Hawaiian descent (specifically from the K\u0101naka Maoli) who lives with his divorced mom, Kona, and his step-father Dirk in Hazelnut. He is an excellent artist, having designed the school year book cover. But Milo can do more than just art, he is the preacher for Pepper Ann, before she does something she will regret. She rarely listens to his advice, but it does not discourage him from trying.\n\nIn \"[[The Finale]]\", it is established that in the series' version of [[2013]], Milo grows up to become a successful artist and marries a woman named Bettina. Together, they have an infant daughter named Zoe.\n\n===Personality===\nMilo is a very lax, almost stoner-like, individual who is always \"going with the flow\" and making astute observations. He is more likely to maintain a very calm and nonchalant attitude towards situations and tries to be helpful and sincere to those around him. Because his two best friends are both girls, he is something of a feminist and is more in tune with how girls think unlike his other masculine peers. While usually down-to-earth, there are times where he does display some jealousy or anger towards someone who does not sit well with his mindset. Being an artist, he takes his work seriously and will become disturbed whenever someone jeopardizes his artistic vision. Nevertheless, he is a very reliable person and very open-minded.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nMilo is a tall and slender Hawaiian boy with brown skin and long blue hair. He has defined eyes with one slightly bigger than the other. He wears a yellow and orange split shirt with a green button up on the collar, greyish-blue shorts and green shoes with white socks. His most identifiable trademark is a purple beanie with a green, yellow and orange rim around it.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nMilo-.jpg\nYou_Oughta_Be_In_Musicals.JPG\nQuiz_Bowl.JPG\nVlcsnap-2012-05-03-04h00m11s185.jpg\nCruchpod.JPG\nMilo Kamalani.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Pepper Ann}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kamalani, Milo}}\n[[Category:Pepper Ann characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Artists]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Polynesian characters]]"
