She was the manager of Big Coffee and [[Cricket Green]] and [[Gloria Sato|Gloria]]'s constantly grumpy and monosyllabic boss.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nMs. Cho is the constantly grumpy manager of Big Coffee. She is always disappointed with her surroundings, usually because she expects order in her small coffee business. She hardly ever shows compassion towards anyone, however she is not unreasonable. She is quick to negotiate and she appears sociable enough to befriend, and even fall in love, with other people.\n===Physical appearance===\nMs. Cho is a short and squat old woman with reddish purple skin. She has thin eyes with tiny angry eyebrows and her mouth is constantly in a down turned grimace that seems permanent (though in \"[[Cricket's Kapowie]]\" she did briefly smile). She big shoulders made possible from the navy blue coat she wears. Underneath is a yellow blouse and a blue skirt, matched with light brown shoes. She has dark blue hair with a bun ponytail in the back and noticeable bangs.\n==Role in the series==\nMs. Miriam Cho was the owner of Big Coffee. It was unknown how long she had run the place, but apparently it was long enough to take her job seriously. Her main purpose seems to be to make sure that [[Gloria Sato]] was always doing her job and while she is the only employee seen, it is implied that she had other employees as well. In her first appearance, \"[[Critterball Crisis]]\", she nearly fires Gloria, but [[Cricket Green]] stands up for her and agrees to start working there with her to pay off the damages. Ms. Cho agrees to the decision and hires Cricket on the spot.\n\nMs. Cho is shown to put up with the antics of the Greens in a rather eccentric behavior quite well. In \"[[Cricket's Shoes]]\", she did not mind [[Tilly Green|Tilly]] replacing Cricket as long as she got the work done and allowed them to make a garden above her building as long as they shared the profits in \"[[Level Up (Big City Greens)|Level Up]]\". She seemed to defend her employees up until the events of \"[[Chipwrecked]]\" where Chip Whistler bought her building with an exorbitant amount, resulting in Ms. Cho, smiling, undoing her bun and speaking in full English \"Peace out, my dudes!\" Ms. Cho has not been seen since and it is implied that she is enjoying her retirement.\n== Trivia==\n\n*She slightly resembles [[Anger]] from ''[[Inside Out]]''.\n*Due to not having any dialogue, aside from a couple of grunts here and there, she shares the same voice as Gloria, Anna Akana.\n**However, Anna was not officially credited for providing Cho's voice until her last appearance in \"[[Chipwrecked]]\"\n**Despite not speaking a word, everyone can apparently understand her.\n*Based on her name, she is most likely Chinese.\n\n==External links==\n\n*{{Interwiki|https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/countryclub9732/images/6/64/Favicon.ico|bigcitygreens|Miriam Cho|Big City Greens Wiki}}\n\n{{Big City Greens}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Big City Greens characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Asian characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Bosses]]"
