At the beginning of ''[[Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep]]'', Eraqus prepares to hold the Mark of Mastery exam. Master Xehanort arrives, along with Ventus, at the Land of Departure and the boy watches Terra and Aqua preparing for their exams. Eraqus begins the exam and in the end, Aqua passes, but Terra fails. Eraqus believes that Terra is not ready because he lacks control over his own darkness. Eraqus, however, is unaware that Master Xehanort had interfered, using his dark powers to affect the course of the exam itself.\n\nAfter Master Xehanort goes missing, Eraqus sends Terra and Aqua to find him, trusting Aqua with responsibility for Terra due to his fear of the man's inner darkness. However, after Terra departs, Ventus leaves as well, so Eraqus instructs Aqua to bring Ventus back. When Terra returns to the Land of Departure, Eraqus attempts to vanquish Ventus to prevent Xehanort from using the boy in his plans. Terra attempts to stop the execution and then soon after, Eraqus senses that Terra has descended into darkness, causing him sadness by the fact that he must eliminate two of his apprentices. As Eraqus charges forward, Ventus is thrown into a portal to another world by Terra while the latter battles Eraqus. Terra wins the battle but spares Eraqus, who expresses remorse for realizing he had turned his Keyblade on his own students. But, as Eraqus dawns on this, Master Xehanort himself appears and finishes Eraqus off, causing him to fade out of existence. Despite his demise, Eraqus' heart found residence within Terra to help him resist Xehanort after Terra would become the villainous Keyblade master's vessel.\n\nIn ''Kingdom Hearts III'', a young Eraqus and Xehanort are seen playing a [[Kingdom Hearts III|game of chess]] in the world of Scala ad Calum, while talking about the first keyblade war. Later on, Eraqus leaves Terra's heart and confronts Xehanort for the last time, convincing Xehanort that it was a checkmate. He helps his old friend pass on to the next life, even briefly turning to their younger selves before departing to Kingdom Hearts.\n\nHe is voiced by Makio Inoue with Daisuke Namikawa as his younger self in the Japanese version, and by [[Mark Hamill]] with [[Drake Bell]] as his younger self in the English version.{{-}}\n\n===Lea===\n{{Main|Lea}}\n\n===Ansem the Wise===\n<tabber>|-|Ansem the Wise=[[File:Ansem the Wise KHII.png|right|100px]]\n'''Ansem the Wise''' is the former sage-king of [[Radiant Garden]]. Many years before the game's current timeline, Ansem the Wise became worried that the darkness of people's hearts would one day swallow his beloved home. In order to understand the heart and counter darkness, Ansem began conducting tests on Xehanort's heart, and eventually constructed a large laboratory in the basement of his castle. However, Ansem's six apprentices used the laboratory in order to conduct inhumane experiments on the human heart. Ansem immediately ordered his apprentices to cease their experiments and sealed the chamber. Ansem's friend, Mickey Mouse eventually advised Ansem the Wise to review the research data. After reading the truth, Ansem began to see that the damage he had done had become irreversible. Eventually, the six apprentices dabbled too deep into the darkness and were consumed by it, and plunged Ansem into the Realm of Nothingness.\n\nAnsem is able to escape, but takes on the new identity of DiZ and conceals his face with red bandages, leaving only his mouth and one eye exposed, and begins planning his revenge against his former apprentices, who have formed [[Organization XIII]]. To that end, he appears to Riku during his journey through the basements of [[Castle Oblivion]] to help guide his path. At the same time, he sets up his new base of operations in the Old Mansion in [[Twilight Town]]. Soon, learning of the existence of [[Roxas]], the [[Nobodies|Nobody]] of Sora, and [[Namin\u00e9]], Kairi's Nobody, when he sees Roxas desert the Organization in order to find Sora, he sends Riku to capture him, while having the pods that Sora, Donald, and Goofy entered to regain their memories moved to the Old Mansion where they would be safe. However, when Riku returns, he has taken on the appearance of [[Ansem, Seeker of Darkness]], having called upon Ansem's Guardian to subdue Roxas following their battle in the Dark City of [[The World That Never Was]]. With Roxas having been captured, DiZ sends him into the virtual Twilight Town to remain there until Sora's memory restoration is complete.\n\nUnfortunately, it is not long before the virtual Twilight Town is compromised when Nobodies manage to breach the world in an attempt to capture Roxas and bring him back to the Organization. Worse, Namin\u00e9 is able to send a virtual copy of herself into the world to help Roxas remember his true self, much to DiZ's frustration. However, when Axel enters to confront Roxas, DiZ is forced to send a virtual copy of himself in to try and intervene. However, Namin\u00e9's interference causes Roxas to come into contact with Kairi, which rapidly speeds up Sora's restoration of his memories. Finally, just as Axel is about to battle Roxas again, DiZ intervenes to tell Roxas to head for the Old Mansion in the virtual world as it is time for him and Sora to reunite. Before that, DiZ reveals his intent to get revenge on Organization XIII to Riku-Ansem, but Riku decides he can't let Sora help DiZ get his vengeance, and delivers two items he removed from the virtual Twilight Town on DiZ's orders to King Mickey to pass on to Sora when Mickey saw him. Meanwhile, DiZ sends his virtual self back in to confront Roxas right before Sora's pod opens, and Roxas, accepting his destiny, reunites with Sora.\n\nWhilst under the guise of DiZ, he infiltrates Organization XIII's homeworld, The World That Never Was, to stop Xemnas by using his machine to digitally encode the artificial Kingdom Hearts. However, he is attacked by Nobodies but is saved by Mickey. Seeing no more reason to hide his identity, DiZ unmasks himself as Ansem. King Mickey asks Ansem why he didn't reveal earlier, but Ansem explains that defeating Organization XIII was his priority because Xemnas is the Nobody of Xehanort. Understanding his task, Mickey accompanies Ansem as he begins encoding Kingdom Hearts. Unfortunately, the power of Kingdom Hearts is too great to be controlled, causing the machine to overload. Sora, Riku, Kairi, Donald, and Goofy, as well as Xemnas, arrive at the duo's location. Ansem, admitting his errors, states that both he and his former apprentices know as little about the heart as they did ten years ago. As the machine then goes critical, Ansem gives King Mickey and Riku his final words, tells Sora that the rest is up to him, and apologizes to Roxas for all that he had put him through. Though Sora and company want to save him, the machine then explodes, apparently killing Ansem. In reality, Ansem survived the explosion but is transported to the Realm of Darkness. Shortly afterward, Ansem is found by Aqua, and explains to her his past deeds, and mentions that a boy with a Keyblade will save the worlds from being engulfed by darkness, as Sora will open the door and help those who are \"crippled\".\n\nIn ''Dream Drop Distance'', a data version of Ansem reveals to Riku that he hid his research inside Sora whilst Namin\u00e9 was repairing his memories. He discovered Sora's ability to connect with the hearts of others and believes that these connections may have the power to bring back those that have been lost or no longer exist.\n\n|-|DiZ=[[File:DizRender.png|right|230px]]\n'''DiZ''' (\"Darkness in Zero\") is a persona used by Ansem the Wise in order to take revenge against his apprentices who placed him in the Realm of Darkness. DiZ found a way to escape the Realm of Darkness when he gained the power of darkness, though he did not intend to become consumed by it. DiZ found residence in an abandoned mansion in [[Twilight Town]], beginning to research the Nobodies and the Heartless. He then infiltrated Organization XIII's second base, Castle Oblivion, and encounters Namin\u00e9. DiZ magically speaks to Riku and guides him through the castle. After Riku escapes the castle, DiZ reveals himself to Riku and King Mickey, and provides them with the black coats of the Organization, as well as a card that will draw out \"Ansem\". Afterward, DiZ continues his plan with Namin\u00e9 to restore Sora's memories, after they were broken apart in Castle Oblivion.\n\nOnce nearly a year has passed, Sora's memory has stopped, and with the memory's [[Xion|carrier]] eliminated by Roxas, DiZ sends Riku to get Roxas. Riku has no choice but to take on the form of Ansem, Seeker of Darkness in order to defeat Roxas. Still, DiZ continues with the plan, placing Roxas into a digital facsimile of Twilight Town where he can live out his days under observation until it is time for him to reunite with Sora.\n\nRoxas fuses with Sora eventually, so Namin\u00e9, Diz, and Riku go their separate paths. At this point in the story, DiZ has eliminated his prejudices against Nobodies.\n</tabber>He is voiced by Genz\u014d Wakayama in the Japanese version and by the late [[Christopher Lee]] (''Kingdom Hearts II'' and ''Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days'') and [[Corey Burton]] in all subsequent appearances of the English version.\n\n===Xehanort===\n{{Main|Xehanort}}\n====Young Xehanort====\n[[File:Young Xehanort - KH3D.png|right|190px]]\n'''Young Xehanort''' (\u30bc\u30a2\u30ce\u30fc\u30c8) is the teenage incarnation of Xehanort who was brought to the future as a member of the true Organization XIII, courtesy of [[Ansem, Seeker of Darkness|Ansem]]. He has the ability to travel through and manipulate time itself, which he has used to travel through time and collect other incarnations of himself as recruits for the Organization. Young Xehanort had also chosen Sora to be the thirteenth vessel for his older self, so he infiltrates Sora and Riku's Mark of Mastery exam, tracking down Sora until he manages to deliver Sora to the Castle That Never Was. When Riku appears to rescue Sora, Young Xehanort battles Riku and rejoins with the rest of the true Organization XIII as Xehanort himself appears. However, when Riku's allies arrive, Young Xehanort and the rest of the members are forced to retreat to their original time.\n\nHe returns in ''Kingdom Hearts III'', conducting experiments on behalf of the Organization with the inhabitants of [[Toy Story|Toy Box]] to find out if it's possible for beings not naturally born to have hearts. After seeing the bond [[Buzz Lightyear|Buzz has]] with [[Woody]] and [[Andy Davis|their owner]], Xehanort concludes the experiment a success. He later warns Sora of misusing the power of waking, as it will doom him to the darkness. Even upon his defeat and return to the past, Xehanort continues to mock Sora for his fate.\n\nHe is voiced by Mamoru Miyano in ''Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep'', and later by Takanori Okuda in ''[[Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance]]: Dream Drop Distance'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]'' in the Japanese version. In the English version, [[Young Xehanort]] is voiced by [[David Gallagher]] in ''Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep'', and later [[Benjamin Diskin]] in ''[[Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance]]'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]''.\n\n===Ansem, Seeker of Darkness===\n{{Main|Ansem, Seeker of Darkness}}\n\n===Vanitas===\n{{Main|Vanitas}}\n\n===Terra-Xehanort===\n[[File:Xehanort KHII.png|right|100px]]\n'''Terra-Xehanort''' is Master Xehanort's heart possessing Terra's body. After obtaining Terra's body, Terra-Xehanort found resistance from the discarded armor of the warrior, now known as the Lingering Will, which was trying to prevent him from escaping with its body. Although he lost, Terra-Xehanort got caught in an explosion caused by the disassembly of the X-blade and was whisked away into the Radiant Garden. He encounters Aqua, whom he then battles, but nearly falls into darkness. In an attempt to save her friend, Aqua sacrifices herself to save him. Back in Radiant Garden, an amnesiac Terra-Xehanort is found by Ansem the Wise, and becomes an apprentice to Ansem, adopting the name '''Xehanort'''.\n\nEventually, he would manipulate the other apprentices into conducting experiments on testing the heart, at the cost of innocent lives lost to create Emblem Heartless. Although Ansem halted the experiments, Xehanort banished him to the Realm of Darkness and decided to use the Heartless' instincts to make his own plans to gain ultimate power, control, and knowledge by gaining [[Kingdom Hearts]]. After using his Keyblade to create Heartless and Nobodies from the apprentices, Xehanort gave into darkness and created the Heartless that called himself \"'''Ansem'''\" and the Nobody known as '''Xemnas'''. With both components having the memories and personality traits of their original self, \"Ansem\" and Xemnas act on the goal to obtain Kingdom Hearts in their own way.\n\nIn ''Kingdom Hearts III'', he serves as a member of the second Organization; while Terra-Xehanort's heart comes from before his amnesia, the body is Terra's from the present. Young Xehanort had placed the past heart in Terra's body, forcing his heart to return to being the Guardian. He appears at the Keyblade Graveyard to kill the guardians of light and take their hearts; however, the Lingering Will stops him. Teaming up with Vanitas, Terra-Xehanort fought Aqua and Ven until Terra breaks free of his control and retakes his body with Sora's help, returning Terra-Xehanort to his proper place in time.\n\nHe is voiced by Akio Otsuka in the Japanese version and by [[Richard Epcar]] in the English version.\n{{-}}\n\n===Hayner===\n[[File:Hayner KHII.png|right|100px]]\n'''Hayner''' is a boy that appears in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]''. A resident of [[Twilight Town]], Hayner is a friend of [[Pence]] and [[Olette]] (and [[Roxas]], or at least the virtual version of himself). He also appears in ''[[Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days]]'' alongside Pence and Olette.\n\nIn [[Ansem the Wise|DiZ]]'s digital [[Twilight Town]], Hayner was Roxas's best friend. In the Struggle tournament, he faces Roxas in the first round and loses. But when Seifer withdraws from the tournament, Hayner is moved up to the third place. In the real Twilight Town, Hayner and his friends seem to recognize [[Sora]] slightly, because they had met Roxas in ''358/2 Days''. Initially, he is somewhat hostile towards Sora, but he warms up to them and goes to see the trio off at the train station. When Sora returns, Hayner, Pence, and Olette attempt to get into the Old Mansion, and helped Sora find the virtual Twilight Town.\n\nIn ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', he is voiced by Kazunori Sasaki in Japanese and Justin Cowden in English, while in ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]'', he is voiced by Makuto Suto in Japanese and [[Zachary Gordon]] in English.{{-}}\n\n===Pence===\n[[File:Pence KHII.png|right|130px]]\n'''Pence''' is a character from ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]''.

He also appears in ''[[Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days]]'', alongside Hayner and Olette, talking to Roxas and ''[[Axel (Kingdom Hearts)|Axel]]''.\n\nIn [[Ansem the Wise|DiZ]]'s Simulated Twilight Town, he, Hayner, and Olette were best friends to Roxas. Later, in the real Twilight Town, he and his friends slightly recognize Sora after he came out of his year-long sleep, but they don't mention Roxas. The trio of friends sends Sora, Donald, and Goofy off at the Train Station. Pence later becomes friends with [[Kairi]] and tries to find her after she is taken by Axel. Outside of the Old Mansion, he, Hayner, and Olette meet up with Sora and eventually find the Simulated Twilight Town through Pence's knowledge of computers.\n\nHe is voiced by Hayato Taya in the Japanese version and by [[Sean Marquette]] in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'' and Tristian Chase in ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]'' for the English version.\n{{-}}\n\n===Olette===\n[[File:Olette KHII.png|right|80px]]\n'''Olette''' is one of the characters in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]''. A resident of [[Twilight Town]], Olette is a fifteen-year-old girl and is a friend of [[Hayner]] and [[Pence]] (and [[Roxas]], or at least the virtual version of herself). She is a kind and caring girl and is the responsible one of the group. She also appears in ''[[Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days]]'', alongside Hayner and Pence, talking to Roxas and [[Axel (Kingdom Hearts)|Axel]].\n\nOlette meets Roxas for the first time in ''Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days'', running into the [[Nobodies|Nobody]] while he explores Twilight Town along with the other members of Hayner's gang. Later in the storyline, after Roxas is captured and defeated by [[Riku]], a data-version of Olette is friends with the Nobody in the Simulated Twilight Town. Later in the game, Olette, Hayner, and Pence meet [[Kairi]], who came to Twilight Town from the [[Destiny Islands]]. Eventually, Axel comes to Twilight Town and kidnaps Kairi again. After this, Olette and her two friends go to the Old Mansion in search of Kairi, where they regroup with Sora. They help discover the Simulated Twilight Town, where Sora left Twilight Town once again.\n\nin ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', she is voiced by Yuka Hirasawa in Japanese and [[Jessica DiCicco]] in English, while in ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]'', she is voiced by Yuna Watanabe in Japanese and Ashley Boettcher in English version.\n{{-}}\n\n===Kairi's Grandma===\n[[File:Kairi's Grandmother Render.png|right|150px]]\n'''Kairi's Grandma''' was an elderly woman who resided in [[Radiant Garden]] with her granddaughter, [[Kairi]]. After [[Aqua]] rescued her granddaughter, Kairi pleads with her grandmother to tell her her favorite fairy tale about the light and the darkness as the two walk away.\n\nIn ''Kingdom Hearts'', Kairi's grandmother appears when Sora experienced Kairi's memories. In the flashback, she told Kairi the story about light and the birth of darkness.\n\nIts currently theorized Kairi's grandmother was one of the original Dandelions trained by Ava, as the story she tells sounds as if she saw it with her own eyes.\n\nShe is voiced by Masako Ikeda in the Japanese version and [[Kathryn Beaumont]] in the English version.\n{{-}}\n\n===Lingering Will===\n[[File:Lingering Will KHIIFM.png|right|250px]]\nThe '''Lingering Will''' is the discarded Keyblade armor of [[Terra]] containing the remnants of its former wearer's soul. It was created following [[Xehanort]]'s possession of Terra to create Terra-Xehanort. In an effort to stop Terra-Xehanort from getting away, Terra's mind finds refuge within Terra's armor and traps Terra-Xehanort inside a force field to engage the latter in battle. The Lingering Will emerges victorious, knocking Terra-Xehanort unconscious. However, Terra-Xehanort is then consumed by an immense sphere of light following the destruction of the \u03c7-blade, leaving the Lingering Will alone in the Keyblade Graveyard. The armor silently promises to set things right for [[Aqua]] and [[Ventus]].\n\nIn ''[[Kingdom Hearts II#Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix .2B|Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix]]'', the armor is encountered by Sora, Donald, and Goofy in the [[Keyblade Graveyard]]. It at first mistakes Sora as [[Riku]] but then as Xehanort before rising up to attack the group. Sora manages to defeat the Lingering Will after an intense battle and it resumes its position. If Sora challenges the Lingering Will for a rematch, it will accept his challenge, but not before stating that it has nothing left to give him and that all it has left is its hatred for Xehanort.\n\nIn ''Kingdom Hearts III'', it is summoned by Namin\u00e9 to conclude its battle with Terra-Xehanort, saving the guardians of light from certain doom. It ultimately sacrifices itself to save a future version of Sora.\n\n===Organization XIII===\n{{Main|Organization XIII}}\n\n====Xemnas====\n{{Main|Xemnas}}\n\n====Xigbar/Braig====\n<tabber>Xigbar=[[File:XigbarDays.png|right|260px]]\n'''Xigbar''' is Rank II within the original Organization and a member of the True Organization XIII. He is the Nobody of '''Braig''', one of the six apprentices of Ansem the Wise. Xigbar has power over space and commands the Sniper Nobodies. In ''[[Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days]]'', Xigbar is featured as a playable character in [[Mission Mode]].\n\nIn ''Kingdom Hearts II'', after appearing to Sora in Hollow Bastion along with the rest of the Organization, Xigbar stays behind to taunt Sora further. He later travels to The Land of Dragons, where he converts a dragon into the Heartless Storm Rider. When Sora catches up to him, Xigbar reveals himself and summons several Snipers to distract Sora and his allies as he makes his getaway. At the [[Castle That Never Was]], Xigbar engages Sora in battle, but ultimately is defeated and fades into darkness.\n\nIn ''[[Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance]]'', Xigbar is revived as part of the true Organization XIII. He confronts Sora in The World That Never Was and explains that he and his companions had orchestrated Sora's journey. Eventually, Sora approaches both Xemnas and Xigbar, who explain that the true purpose of Organization XIII was to create thirteen vessels to harbor pieces of Master Xehanort's heart, with Sora being their intended thirteenth vessel. When Sora resolves to fight the two Organization members, an infuriated Xigbar leaves Xemnas to deal with Sora. Later, in Where Nothing Gathers, Xigbar observes Master Xehanort's attempt to make Sora into his final vessel. However, when rescue arrives to save Sora, and Xigbar is forced to retreat with his accomplices.\n|-|Braig=[[File:Braig2.png|right|180px]]\n'''Braig''' (misspelled as Bleig in the North American versions) is a mercenary for [[Xehanort]], a co-conspirator with Terra-Xehanort, a student of Ansem the Wise, and the original form of '''Xigbar'''. He has a profound interest in the Keyblade.\n\nIn ''Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep'', Braig strikes a deal with Xehanort to give him the means to use a Keyblade in exchange for aiding him in manipulating [[Terra]] into using his darkness. Pretending to have caught Xehanort, Braig confronts Terra who fights him at Xehanort's goading and defeats Braig, resulting in permanent damage on Braig's right eye and scarring on his left cheek. After this, Xehanort places a fragment of his heart inside Braig, who then travels to the Keyblade Graveyard. [[Aqua]] battles Braig for trying to turn them against their friend and defeats him, however Braig is able to return to Radiant Garden. Braig helps Ansem the Wise find Terra-Xehanort. He later helps Terra-Xehanort as Ansem's apprentice before eventually finding himself stabbed with Xehanort's Keyblade with Xigbar manifesting soon after.\n</tabber>He is voiced by Hochu Otsuka in the Japanese version and by [[James Patrick Stuart]] in the English version.\n\n====Xaldin/Dilan====\n<tabber>Xaldin=[[File:Xaldin KHD.png|right|260px]]\n'''Xaldin''' is Rank III within Organization XIII.

In ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', he remains at the castle, attempting to plunge Beast's heart into despair in an attempt to separate the Beast's heart from its body. When Sora arrives, Xaldin had already drained Beast of much of his hope and kindness by convincing him that Belle is plotting against him. Sora and his friends eventually reach Beast's bedroom, but Xaldin tells Beast that they were only there to help Belle against Beast, causing the latter to attack Sora as Xaldin flees, but Sora is able to bring Beast back to his senses. Xaldin strikes again when Sora returns to Beast's Castle and steals Beast's rose. When Belle finds Beast's rose, Xaldin kidnaps her as well as retaking the rose. Xaldin then forces Beast to choose either Belle or the rose to leave behind. Before Beast has time to choose, however, Belle elbows Xaldin in the side and grabs the rose, taking the time from Xaldin's surprise to escape his grasp. Xaldin then battles Sora and Beast, but is eventually defeated and fades into darkness.\n|-|Dilan=[[File:Dilan KHBBS.png|right|170px]]\n'''Dilan''' was one of the six apprentices of Ansem the Wise as well as his castle guard along with Aeleus and the original persona of '''Xaldin'''.\n\nIn ''Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep'', [[Ventus]] encounters them while he is looking for [[Mickey Mouse]], but they refuse to let him in saying that castle is closed. Ven spotted [[w:c:kingdomhearts:Trinity Armor|an Unversed]] and chases it. The two move to follow but Dilan recalls their job to guard the castle, and the two return to their positions. Later, Dilan and the other apprentices find an amnesiac Xehanort nearby the castle. While Braig takes Xehanort to the castle, Dilan carries the armor and Keyblade for Braig. Over time, Ansem would grow worried of the Darkness in people's hearts and so, he created a laboratory in his castle's basement for such experimentation, which caused the apprentices to turn into Heartless and Nobodies, Dilan becoming Xaldin. The six Nobodies formed Organization XIII, and banished Ansem the Wise to the Realm of Darkness.\n\nDilan is resurrected following the destruction of his Heartless and Xaldin, and awakens with the other apprentices in Hollow Bastion.

Vexen then confronts Sora and forces Sora to enter a memory of [[Twilight Town]]. After battling and losing, and seeing that Sora is too dangerous, Vexen plans to tell him of Marluxia's plot and Roxas, but he is incinerated by Axel before he can reveal this.\n\nVexen returns in ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]'' as a member of [[Xehanort]]'s True Organization XIII but this time with his eyes glowing yellow to represent a Seeker of Darkness. Demyx was a member of the Organization, until he was benched by the replicas.\n|-|Even=[[File:Even KHBBS.png|right|100px]]\n'''Even''' is a former apprentice of Ansem the Wise and the original persona of '''Vexen'''.\n\nIn ''Kingdom Hearts Birth By Sleep'', a decade prior to ''Kingdom Hearts'', Even was a scientist for Ansem the Wise and Ienzo's caretaker. He first approaches Dilan and Aeleus when the two guards wanted to save Ventus from an Unversed, but Even assures them that Ventus could handle it. After Ienzo wandered off, Even found him walking towards Ventus, reminding Ienzo not to leave because it is dangerous. However, Even thanks Ventus for finding Ienzo. Over time, Ansem would grow worried of the Darkness in people's hearts and so, he created a laboratory in his castle's basement for such experimentation, which caused the apprentices to turn into Heartless and Nobodies, Even becoming Vexen.

The senior members decide to make similar use of Riku by creating the Riku Replica. However, when Vexen is destroyed, the replica wanders off, so, Lexaeus confronts Riku. He tries to sway Riku to give in to the darkness inside him and use his full powers. Riku refuses to cooperate, and Lexaeus attacks him. However, Riku's defeat allows Ansem, Seeker of Darkness to take control and destroys Lexaeus. In the original Chain of Memories game, Lexaeus instead died in a sacrificial attack, in a final attempt to eliminate Riku.\n|-|Aeleus=[[File:Aeleus KHBBS.png|right|150px]]\n'''Aeleus''' was one of [[Ansem the Wise]]'s six apprentices and a guard of his palace, as well as the human form of '''Lexaeus'''.\n\nIn ''Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep'', he and Dilan meet [[Ventus]], but keep him from getting inside the castle, telling him to leave before the [[Unversed|monsters]] come out.

Zexion soon learns that Marluxia intends to take control of Organization XIII, with the help of Larxene, by using Sora as their puppet. The senior members decide to oppose Marluxia's plot by having Vexen investigate Marluxia under the guise of offering to help using the Riku Replica he creates with combat data from the real Riku. However, Vexen is eventually killed by Axel, so Lexaeus tries to sway Riku into joining them, but Lexaeus is destroyed as well. Zexion then appears before Riku and creates an illusion of Destiny Islands, playing on Riku's guilt by telling him Sora will always oppose him as a host of the dark. However, Riku is able to overcome the facade with the power of darkness and defeats Zexion. Zexion is forced to flee, but he is absorbed by the Riku Replica before he can do anything, destroying him.\n|-|Ienzo=[[File:Ienzo KH3D.png|right|120px]]\n'''Ienzo''' was one of Ansem the Wise's six apprentices, as well as the human form of '''Zexion'''.\n\nIn ''Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep'', a young Ienzo was attacked by [[Unversed]] until [[Ventus]] came to his rescue. Shortly after the battle, Even arrived and gave Ventus both his and Ienzo's thanks, explaining that he had been assigned to take care of Ienzo since the death of his parents, and returned to the castle with Ienzo. However, Ansem would grow worried of the Darkness in people's hearts and so, he created a laboratory in his castle's basement for such experimentation, which caused the apprentices to turn into Heartless and Nobodies, Ienzo becoming Zexion. The six Nobodies formed Organization XIII and banished Ansem the Wise to the Realm of Darkness.\n\nIn ''[[Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance]]'', the destruction of Zexion allows Ienzo to be restored to human form, now as an adult, in Hollow Bastion along with the apprentices and Lea, where he explains to Lea about how a person is meant to return to human form in the same world they lost their heart, which prompts Lea to go out to search for Braig and Isa.\n</tabber>He is voiced by Akira Ishida in the Japanese version and by Vincent Corazza in the English version.\n\n====Sa\u00efx/Isa====\n<tabber>Sa\u00efx=[[File:SiaxDays.png|right|150px]]\n'''Sa\u00efx''' is Rank VII within Organization XIII, as well as the second-in-command, and the secondary antagonist in both ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days]]''. He derives power from the Moon while wielding a claymore. He commands the [[w:c:kingdomhearts:Berserker|Berserker]] Nobodies. He is the Nobody of '''Isa'''.\n\nIn ''Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days'', Sa\u00efx oversees the operation with Xion and Roxas, but with a growing friendship between Axel, Roxas, and Xion, a rift between Sa\u00efx and Axel begins to form before he confronts Axel himself. In ''Kingdom Hearts II'', he visits Sora and his friends in [[Twilight Town]], warning them of Axel, now considered a traitor in the Organization, for Axel will stop at nothing to turn Sora into a Heartless while the Organization wants nothing to happen to Sora. During the [[w:c:kingdomhearts:Battle of 1000 Heartless|Heartless Invasion]] at [[Hollow Bastion]], and reveals that [[Kairi]] is their captive, and asks Sora to prove just how much he cares about Kairi. In response, Sora willingly begs at the Nobody's feet, which Sa\u00efx refuses sadistically upon to enrage him and reveals that the Heartless Sora destroys will only further the creation of the Organization's artificial [[Kingdom Hearts (world)|Kingdom Hearts]]. However, [[Maleficent]] appears, refusing to let the Organization claim Kingdom Hearts, and holds off Sa\u00efx to allow Sora and the others to escape. To Sa\u00efx's chagrin, Kairi is able to escape with help from [[Namin\u00e9]] in the Organization's castle. Sa\u00efx attempts to stop Kairi and Namin\u00e9, but Riku attacks him from behind, holding him down until Sa\u00efx escapes. After releasing Heartless upon the heroes, Sora confronts Sa\u00efx, who calls Sora \"Roxas\" before battling the group. However, despite the incredible power and abilities he drew from Kingdom Hearts, Sa\u00efx is destroyed. In ''[[Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance]]'', Sa\u00efx is brought back as one of the thirteen vessels for Master Xehanort's heart, shocking Lea when the two fight each other. After Donald and Goofy arrive, Sa\u00efx and the rest of the true Organization XIII return to their own time periods to await the time to strike again.\n\nSa\u00efx returns in ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]'' visiting his ex-best friend Lea at Twilight Town\u2019s Clock Tower.\n|-|Isa=[[File:Isa.png|right|150px]]\n'''Isa''' was the original persona of '''Sa\u00efx'''. He was a close friend of [[Lea]], [[Axel (Kingdom Hearts)|Axel]]'s original form when the two lived in Radiant Garden.\n\nIn ''Kingdom Hearts Birth By Sleep'', Isa meets Ventus in Radiant Garden and properly introduces himself with Lea. The two befriend him, though Isa is not as forthcoming as Lea is. Afterward, at an unknown point in time, Isa's heart was consumed by darkness, turning him into a [[Heartless]]. However, his strong will gave him the ability to continue on as his Nobody, Sa\u00efx.

He controls water and uses his weapon, the sitar, as a musical instrument to make water fight for him in battle. He commands the [[w:c:kingdomhearts:Dancer|Dancer]] Nobodies. He is generally lazy, preferring reconnaissance missions over those requiring him to fight.\n\nNothing has yet been revealed about who Demyx was before he became a Nobody and joined Organization XIII, except that his former self was present during the events of the Keyblade War.\n\nIn ''358/2 Days'' Demyx reluctantly agrees to be on missions with Roxas out of fear of what Xemnas would do to him.\n\nIn ''Kingdom Hearts II'', Demyx is assigned to look after Sora's progress and continue collecting hearts for the Organization. Later, Demyx steals the Olympus Stone in [[Ancient Greece|Olympus Coliseum]] and soon encounters Sora within the Underworld once more. After attempting to talk to Roxas through Sora, Demyx pits him against his water copies but is unsuccessful in defeating Sora and escapes instead of continuing the fight. Demyx later confronts Sora in Hollow Bastion during the Battle of the 1000 Heartless, again greeting Sora in a rather friendly manner. However, Sora and his companions' response is hostile, even claiming that Demyx is unable to fight. When Sora and co. claim that the Nobodies do not have hearts, Demyx's normal carefree air vanishes, and he silences them with a much darker tone and attacks with all his strength. In the end, however, Demyx fades into darkness.\n\nDemyx returns in ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]'' as a member of [[Xehanort]]'s Real Organization XIII but this time with his eyes glowing yellow to represent a Seeker of Darkness. Demyx was a member of the Organization until he was benched by the replicas. He was persuaded by Vexen into helping him deliver Ienzo a vessel for Roxas, as well as transporting Ansem the Wise back to Radiant Garden.\n\nHe is voiced by Kenichi Suzumura in the Japanese version and by [[Ryan O'Donohue]] in the English version.\n\n====Luxord====\n[[File:KHLuxord.png|right|200px]]\n'''Luxord''' is Rank X within Organization XIII.

He commands the [[w:c:kingdomhearts:Gambler|Gambler]] Nobodies.\n\nNothing has yet been revealed about who Luxord was before he became a Nobody and joined Organization XIII, except that his former self was present during the events of the Keyblade War.\n\nLuxord appears as a supporting character in ''Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days'', often teaming up with [[Roxas]] in missions in [[Wonderland]], but not playing a major role in the game's plot.\n\nLuxord then appears in ''Kingdom Hearts II'', as the mastermind behind the theft of cursed pirate gold in Port Royal. When Sora allies with [[Jack Sparrow]], Luxord appears on the ''Black Pearl'' after they have recovered Will, with the cursed gold beside him. He reveals that he is at Port Royal to assess the value of the cursed gold to the Organization and invokes the right of {{WikipediaLink|parley}} before Jack can get off a shot with his pistol. He agrees to hand over the chest but takes four medallions from it when he does so, sending them off to his Gambler Nobodies, who escape with them. This has the effect of returning the curse on Jack. After defeating the Grim Reaper and lifting Jack's curse, Luxord manages to bring the Grim Reaper's heart to Kingdom Hearts and promptly flees. Luxord reappears in Organization XIII's fortress in The World that Never Was. When Sora, [[Kairi]], [[Riku]], Donald, and Goofy enter the area where Luxord waits, Luxord uses his cards to remove Sora's allies from the area and challenges Sora to a game involving time. Luxord fights against Sora, but Sora is able to defeat him. Luxord will once again appear in Port Royal and within its [[Caribbean]] expansion.\n\nLuxord returns in ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]'' as a member of [[Xehanort]]'s Real Organization XIII but this time with his eyes glowing yellow to represent a Seeker of Darkness. He was encountered in the new Caribbean expansion world where he is looking for the [[Dead Man's Chest]] whom he believes is connected to the \"black box\" and participated in the Battle of the Maelstrom alongside [[Davy Jones]] and the [[Kraken]].\n\nLuxord later participated in the Keyblade war against the Guardians of Light. He trapped Mickey into a card until he was slain by Sora once again. As he was fading, he gave the young Keyblade warrior a card that would help him out.\n\nHe is voiced by J\u014dji Nakata in the Japanese version and by [[Robin Atkin Downes]] in the English version.\n\n====Marluxia/Lauriam====\n<tabber>Marluxia=[[File:Marluxia Days.png|right|250px]]\n'''Marluxia''' is Rank XI within Organization XIII and the lord of [[Castle Oblivion]], one of the organization's bases. He controls flowers and commands the Reaper Nobodies, and can attack opponents with his massive scythe. He is the Nobody of '''Lauriam'''.\n\nHe makes an appearance in ''Kingdom Hearts: 358/2 Days''. Like other members of the Organization, Marluxia aids [[Roxas]] in at least one mission and is polite to Roxas in their mission.\n\nHe appears again in ''Chain of Memories'', as the main antagonist. Originally discovered by senior Organization members [[Xigbar]] and [[Xaldin]], Marluxia is the mastermind of an internal rebellion in the Organization against [[Xemnas]]. Working with Larxene, they plan to use a Nobody named [[Namin\u00e9]] to deceive Sora and use him to defeat the senior Organization members. Marluxia and Larxene eventually learn that Vexen has been reporting back to [[Lexaeus]] and [[Zexion]] regarding their revolt, and threatens to tell \"[[Xemnas|the Superior]]\" of the Riku-Replica's failure. Vexen agrees to eliminate Sora if Marluxia doesn't reveal this. However, before he can reveal the truth to Sora, Vexen is assassinated by Axel to allow the latter the full trust of Marluxia and Larxene. Once Marluxia and Larxene are gone, Axel allows Namin\u00e9 to escape, freeing her from Marluxia's control and allowing her to tell Sora the truth, ruining Marluxia's plot. Immediately afterward, Larxene appears before Sora and Namin\u00e9, revealing their plot before attacking Sora and his friends in a fit of rage. She is defeated and destroyed, leaving only Marluxia. Confronted by Axel, Marluxia makes Namin\u00e9 appear in front of him to provoke Sora (who had just appeared in the room) into attacking Axel as he vanishes. After defeating Axel, Sora pursues Marluxia into his inner chambers. Marluxia orders Namin\u00e9 to completely erase Sora's memory, but Namin\u00e9, remembering Sora's kindness towards her, refuses the order along with the Riku-Replica. Confused and irritated that Sora and the replica would accept their memories of Namin\u00e9, Marluxia attacks them. Sora destroys Marluxia, but finds that the real Marluxia had been hiding in a back room. Sora advances into the final room to confront Marluxia and, after a difficult battle, defeats him, causing Marluxia to fade into darkness in a flurry of flower petals.\n\nMarluxia returns in ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]'' as a member of [[Xehanort]]'s Real Organization XIII but this time with his eyes glowing yellow to represent as a Seeker of Darkness. He was encountered in the [[Corona|Kingdom of Corona]] where he has a brief reunion with Sora and targeted [[Rapunzel]] as part of the new Seven Hearts of Light. He turned [[Mother Gothel]] into a Heartless in order to combat Sora.\n\nMarluxia returned to participate in the Keyblade war against the Guardians of Light. He was slain by Sora, whom he thanked for allowing him to have his emotions and memories of his former self again.\n\nMarluxia is voiced by Sh\u016bichi Ikeda in the Japanese version and by [[Keith Ferguson]] in the English version.\n|-|Lauriam=[[File:Lauriam KHUX.png|right|80px]]\n\n'''Lauriam''' was a Keyblade wielder during the events of the Keyblade War.

Lauriam also searches for his younger sister, Strelizia, that was supposed to be one of the Union leaders but went  missing before the war. As he looks for his sister, he meets Elrena, a member of the Dandelions that was Strelizia's occasional teammate on missions. Elrena tries to help him to search for clues to solve the mystery of Strelitzia's disappearance, but they are both still unable to figure out what happened to her.\n</tabber>\n\n====Larxene/Elrena====\n<tabber>Larxene=[[File:Larxene Days.png|right|130px]]\n'''Larxene''' is Rank XII within Organization XIII. Larxene is the group's only female member, and also has a very sadistic nature. She controls lightning and the Ninja Nobodies. She uses her powers along with throwing knives to thrash opponents with rapid attacks. She is the Nobody of '''Elrena'''.\n\nShe became a Nobody and joined Organization XIII but this time with her eyes glowing yellow to represent as a Seeker of Darkness. She will be encountered in [[Arendelle]] intending to corrupt Elsa.\n\nIn ''358/2 Days'', Larxene showed a true hatred with having to train Roxas. She slipped out the fact there was another Keyblade wielder besides Roxas. Upon being asked who it was, she replied, \"Mind your own beeswax\".\n\nIn ''Chain of Memories'', Larxene is assigned to Castle Oblivion to help conduct experiments on memories. As soon as Sora enters Castle Oblivion, Namin\u00e9 begins manipulating his memories as per Marluxia's orders. At that point, Larxene confronts Sora directly, revealing Namin\u00e9 is being held hostage in the castle and attacks him viciously. Larxene fights Sora, taunting him and calling him heartless for \"forgetting\" about Namin\u00e9, before being defeated and escaping. Larxene is later approached by Vexen, who offers to help her, Axel and Marluxia evaluate Sora's power with the Riku Replica. As per Larxene's suggestion, Vexen decides to have Namin\u00e9 alter the replica's memory so that it would think it is the real Riku, much to the replica's chagrin. After Axel's betrayal, Larxene reveals the truth to Sora before attacking him in a rage. Larxene is eventually defeated in a battle against Sora and fades back into darkness.\n\nLarxene returns in ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]'' as a member of [[Xehanort]]'s Real Organization XIII but this time with her eyes glowing yellow to represent as a Seeker of Darkness. She is encountered in [[Arendelle]] intending to corrupt [[Elsa]]. Larxene later participated in the Keyblade war against the Guardians of Light.

Elrena and Strelitzia were occasional teammates on missions, so she is surprised to know about her disappearance. Elrena decides to help Lauriam to find his sister, even if helping other people is not something she usually does. She goes to investigate the building Strelitzia was last seen, and she sees hologram of Strelitzia carrying her Chirithy, but she is unable to figure out what it means. During their next encounter, Elrena tells Lauriam about what she saw inside the building and is saddened in seeing his frustration for not finding his sister.\n</tabber>\n\n====Roxas====\n{{Main|Roxas}}\n\n====Xion====\n{{Main|Xion}}\n\n===Riku Replica===\n<tabber>Riku Replica=[[File:Riku Replica.png|right|200px]]\n'''Riku Replica''' is a Replica made of data from Vexen's research of Riku who appeared in ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories]]'' and acts as an antagonist in Sora's story and Riku's story while they were in [[Castle Oblivion]].\n\nOriginally a subject to test the real Riku, the Replica quickly loses due to a lack of experience. Despite his failure, the Organization exploits him afterward by having Namin\u00e9 rewrite the replica's memories so that he can be a more useful tool to use in manipulating Sora. As a result, Riku Replica believes himself to be the real Riku and swears to protect Namin\u00e9. Sora encounters the revised replica and mistakes him for the real Riku when they engage in battle, but the replica escapes after the battle passes. Riku Replica's false memories come to an end when he meets again with Sora, and when Sora tried to help him, the Replica knocked Sora back. Just as the replica was about to kill Sora, a desperate Namin\u00e9 shatters Riku Replica's false memories and his heart with them. Although seemingly comatose, Riku Replica reappears at the top floor, where he saves Namin\u00e9 from Marluxia as, despite losing his memory, he remembered his oath to protect Namin\u00e9. After Marluxia's defeat, he leaves Sora and Namin\u00e9 to confront the real Riku. After absorbing Zexion, which kills the Organization member in the process, he engages Riku, intending to make himself the only true Riku. In the end, the replica is defeated. With his dying breath, he asks Riku where a replica's heart like his would go. Riku comforts the replica, stating that it would go to the same place as his. The replica smiles, accepting that he will simply be a replica to the end, before fading back into the Darkness.\n\nThe replica later reappears in ''Kingdom Hearts III'', where he serves as an ally to Riku. In the Realm of Darkness, the replica shares his strength to Riku, explaining that he still has unfinished business. After Sora and Riku defeat his past self, Dark Riku, at the Keyblade Graveyard, the Replica removes his past self's heart from his replica body, but rather than take the body for himself, leaves it behind for Namin\u00e9 to use.\n\n|-|Dark Riku=[[File:Dark Riku - KH3.png|thumb]]\n'''Dark Riku''' is a past version of the Riku Replica and a member of the real Organization XIII.\n\nIn ''Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance'', Dark Riku first appears in Prankster's Paradise to harass Riku and recreate his abduction of Pinocchio. When Riku catches him, Dark Riku reveals his face before disappearing. Later, Dark Riku joins the rest of the real Organization to watch as Master Xehanort prepares to induct Sora as the final member, but disappears back into his time after interference.\n\nIn ''Kingdom Hearts III'', Dark Riku attacks San Fransokyo to se if the real Organization can recreate a heart from data. He has his Darkubes attack the city, Sora's team, and Big Hero 6 to forge a heart from conflict before using it to corrupt Baymax's original body. At the Keyblade Graveyard, Dark Riku fights Sora and Riku alongside Xigbar but is soon defeated.

In addition, when Sora talks to the Nameless Star, she tells him that she is waiting for Yozora, explaining that his heart has been replaced by another's and that he no longer remembers her.\n\nIn ''Kingdom Hearts III Re Mind'', Yozora meets Sora in the Final World after Master Xehanort's defeat and cryptically explains that he was tasked to save Sora before the two battle in Shibuya.

They generally operate their omnipresent stores through holograms, instead of in person, as they hate getting their pom-poms ruffled. Moogles appear to have no true allegiance with the game's villainous entities, as many were not spared of their homeworld's destruction by [[Maleficent]]'s forces and were forced into Traverse Town, while a Moogle wearing a [[Black coat]] was seen enjoying a business relationship with [[Organization XIII]], but it holds no loyalty to them.\n\nA type of Moogle known as an '''Org Moogle''' is present in the games that seem to work for Organization XIII willingly and is identified by the [[Black coat|black uniform]]. It is unknown if he is a normal Moogle who just works for them, or if he is possibly a Moogle Nobody.

Sora, Donald, and Goofy later learn the truth of Sephiroth's being and inform Cloud that Sephiroth wants to see him so they can settle their feud. Cloud arrives, and they initiate a battle, with Sephiroth desiring to draw Cloud into the darkness. However, Tifa protects Cloud, saying that Cloud does have light in him and that even if he doesn't, then he just needs to be surrounded by light. Nevertheless, Sephiroth and Cloud start off for another battle, and after Tifa's intervention, Cloud glows in light, surprising Sephiroth. The two disappear in a brilliant flash of light, their fate afterward is unknown.\n\nAlthough Sephiroth doesn't appear in the prequel ''Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep'', he is indirectly alluded to by Zack, who stated he was training to become a soldier at the Olympic Coliseum to emulate a hero of his. In addition, it is implied that Sephiroth ambushed Zack in the ending.\n\nHe is voiced by Toshiyuki Morikawa in the Japanese version of the series.

Seifer is always seen with his posse Fuu, Rai, and Vivi. He shares a rivalry with Hayner and his gang, and often picks fights with them. Seifer is cocky, sarcastic, and a self-proclaimed protector of order, but is in actuality a bully to others.\n\nIn the Simulated Twilight Town, Seifer is the leader of the town's Disciplinary Committee, and is a rival of [[Roxas]], always calling him a chicken-wuss and picking fights with him and his friends. Ironically, Seifer is the first clue that the town was virtual and there was a malfunction in the virtual world; when he taunts Roxas, things start to get slow and strange. In the real Twilight Town, when he meets [[Sora]], [[Donald Duck|Donald]], and [[Goofy]], he treats them like Roxas in the simulated Twilight Town. However, when they save him and his gang from trouble, he gives them the Struggle Trophy, a sign of great respect.\n\nIn ''Kingdom Hearts III'', citizens of Twilight Town note the Seifer went on a warrior's journey along with his gang, in order to improve his skills.\n\nHe is voiced by Takehito Koyasu in the Japanese version and by [[Will Friedle]] in the English version. He originated in ''Final Fantasy VIII''.{{-}}\n\n====Rai====\n[[File:Rai KHII.png|right|120px]]\n'''Rai''', along with Fuu and Vivi is a member of the \"Twilight Town Disciplinary Committee\" led by Seifer. He isn't terribly bright, but that's not too much of an impediment since his main role in the gang is to toss his considerable weight around.

His Original name is '''Raijin'''.\n\nHe is voiced by Kazuya Nakai in the Japanese version and by Brandon Adams in the English version.

He is one of Seifer's gang's members, and the only member not from ''Final Fantasy VIII''.\n\nIn the simulated Twilight Town, Vivi enters the Struggle competition, but his data soon becomes possessed by a Nobody and he gains incredible powers. He easily defeats Seifer with his fast movement and speed until he is defeated by Roxas, forcing Vivi's data to reveal its true form as a Dusk. After the Dusk is defeated, the real Vivi appears, wondering how he got here. Roxas later fights fourteen Vivis (created by Nobodies hacking the system) in a tunnel. Vivi reappears, and after Roxas and company move away from the tunnel, it reveals its true form to be a Dusk.\n\nHis Struggle battle may be an homage to the Black Magic that he uses in'' Final Fantasy IX''. Furthermore, that Nobodies masquerade as him is a reference to his original Final Fantasy incarnation: in ''Final Fantasy IX'', Black Mages were a race of magical beings created from Mist that did not possess souls. Thus most of them only lived a year before their bodies slowly shut down, but as the prototype Black Mage, Vivi had a much higher life expectancy.\n\nHe is voiced by Ikue \u014ctani in the Japanese version and by [[Melissa Disney]] in the English version. He originated in ''Final Fantasy IX''.\n\n====Setzer====\n[[File:Setzer KHII.png|right|200px]]\n'''Setzer Gabbiani''' is a resident of Twilight Town.

Roxas faces him in the final competition, but the outcomes for whether or not he wins are different; if Roxas wins the Struggle, Setzer leaves the arena quietly, then joins in cheering Roxas as the new champion, but if Roxas loses, Setzer gives him a medal as \"thanks\".\nWhen Sora is in the real Twilight Town later in the game, Setzer can be fought after defeating Hayner ten times. It is implied that Seifer defeated Setzer, like Roxas in Data Twilight Town.\n\nHe is voiced by Ry\u014dtar\u014d Okiayu in the Japanese version and by [[Crispin Freeman]] in the English version. He originated in ''Final Fantasy VI''.

During the events in [[Ancient Greece|Olympus Coliseum]], he is an ally to [[Sora]].\n\nAt Pete's suggestion, [[Hades]] revives Auron from the dead and offers him freedom from the Underworld if he kills [[Hercules (character)|Hercules]]. Auron declines and insults him, causing Hades, in a rage, to attack him just as Sora comes in, and the group escapes, Auron joining them. Soon after escaping Cerberus, Auron disappears. Auron is later revealed to be the final contestant in the Hades Cup, who was fighting to atone for his crime \u2014 to have existed. When Hades tells Auron to not only defeat Hercules, but also get rid of Sora, Donald, and [[Goofy]], Auron refuses, forcing Hades seal Auron's free will into a doll and forces him to fight Hercules.

She nearly catches up to Cloud during the Heartless invasion, but he chases after Sephiroth, leaving her to fight a large group of Heartless on her own. She later fights alongside Sora in the Ravine Trail, preceded by Yuffie and Leon, and followed by Cloud. After Sora defeats Sephiroth in battle, he finds Cloud and tells him that Sephiroth is waiting for their battle. It is when this confrontation reaches its climax that Tifa finally catches up to Cloud. She tries to help Cloud, saying that all that needs to be done is to surround him in light, and telling Sephiroth that the darkness will always be there, but in a place that he can't reach. She fights with Sephiroth very briefly, then gives Cloud the light to overcome his darkness, after which the two men return to battle and disappear once again, leaving her to continue the pursuit.\n\nShe is voiced by Ayumi Ito in the Japanese version and by [[Rachael Leigh Cook]] in the English version.

Sora, Donald, and [[Goofy]] first encounter the Gullwings in their third visit to Hollow Bastion, where the Gullwings inquire about the recent activities of Leon's group. Rikku nearly reveals that they are working for Maleficent, but Paine quickly stops her from doing so. She assures Sora that they come in peace and then teleports away. Yuna and Rikku follow, but not before Yuna apologizes to Sora and company for bothering them.\n\nThey reappear during the Battle of the 1000 Heartless, during which they cast away their allegiance to Maleficent and join the Restoration Committee in exchange for any treasure they might have. They then aid the Committee against the Heartless. After the war, they realize they had been tricked, but decide that it wouldn't be right to take the items after all that Sora and his friends had been through and assure him that they will root for them.\n\nIn the Japanese version, Yuna, Rikku, and Paine are respectively voiced by Mayuko Aoki, Marika Matsumoto, and Megumi Toyoguchi.

He is an anti-social teenage boy who claims he does not \"get\" people, and rarely interacts with others. In the game, Neku stumbles across Sora in Traverse Town, whom he teaches the concept of Spirits and Nightmares to. However, Neku betrays Sora to a man in a black coat as part of a bargain, only for the man to try and attack Sora which was what Neku was against. After Sora forgives him, the players are reunited with their game partners with the help of [[Joshua]].\n\nBy the end of the story, Sora has had a positive influence on Neku; he sees Joshua as he's friend and hopes to see him again in Shibuya.\n\nHe is voiced by K\u014dki Uchiyama in the Japanese version and by Jesse David Corti in the English version.\n{{-}}\n====Shiki====\n[[File:Shiki KH3D.png|right|90px]]\n'''Shiki Misaki''' is a cheerful and energetic teenage girl who carries her stuffed animal named, Mr. Mew, as her sole method of attacking in combat, and is Neku's partner.

Joshua bends the rules of the Reapers' Game twice by asking Riku and Sora (non-players of the Reapers' Game) to help. Unlike the other characters in Traverse Town that are involved with the Reapers game, Joshua is aware of the time differences in the Dream Worlds that Sora visits compared to Riku and educates this fact to Riku as well as stressing the inevitable peril that is bound to befall on him and Sora by Xehanort's forces.\n\nWhile Sora and Riku never discover Joshua's true identity in the game, in his original world, Joshua is the god-like being known as the Composer, who is in charge of both the living world and the afterlife.

The Experiment wanders out into the woods and into [[Christmas Town]], where it steals Christmas presents from [[Santa Claus (The Nightmare Before Christmas)|Santa Claus]]' workshop. This causes the presents to go missing and [[Jack Skellington|Jack]] becoming blamed for this, although he decides to help catch the thief by using the remaining presents as bait. When the Experiment comes to steal them, the group ambushes and battles it. They are able to subdue the Experiment and bring it back to Finkelstein. Santa Claus theorizes that the machine was probably looking for a heart, which it had lacked, and believes this was why it was stealing the presents because the joy of the presents would be enough to give it a heart.\n\n===Xehanort's Guardian===\n[[File:GuardianBbS.png|right|200px]]\n'''Xehanort's guardian''' is a dark entity bearing [[Terra]]'s heart, bound to the will of Xehanort.

It first appeared in ''Birth By Sleep''; after Terra-Xehanort lost to Aqua, his rage spawned the Guardian. After Xehanort locked his heart in an attempt to stop Terra from struggling to expel his invading heart, the Guardian was freed of his control; by Terra's will, it dragged Terra-Xehanort into a portal to the realm of darkness in an attempt to keep his friends safe from him. However, Aqua saved Terra-Xehanort and took his place in the darkness.\n\nIn ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]'', the Guardian appears jointly under Ansem and Terra-Xehanort's control until the final battle against Organization XIII.

But when Terra-Xehanort drops Aqua and Ventus down, the Guardian emerges and catches the two in time before going after Terra-Xehanort. The Guardian then rips off its bandages and speaks in Terra's voice, echoing his promise to protect Aqua and Ven. Sora uses his Keyblade to free Terra's heart, allowing it to return to Terra's body and expel Xehanort's heart as the Guardian ceases to be.\n\n===Sora's Heartless===\n[[File:Sora-Heartless (Phase 2).png|right|200px]]\n'''Sora's Heartless''' appears at the end of ''Kingdom Hearts'', when Sora releases his heart. Unlike other Heartless, Sora's Heartless managed to retain his original thoughts and memories, allowing Kairi to turn him back to normal. However, traces of his Heartless were left, which is what makes Anti Form possible. His Heartless was a major enemy in ''Kingdom Hearts coded'' that was destroyed by Data-Sora, cleansing the Journal of its bugs.\n\n{{Kingdom Hearts}}\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts characters| ]]\n[[Category:Lists]]\n[[Category:Character lists]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Square Enix characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Disney Interactive Studios characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in video games]]\n[[Category:Non-Disney characters]]"
