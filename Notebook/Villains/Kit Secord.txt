On her seventh birthday, she receives a surprise package, revealing she is next in line to become the Rocketeer, a legendary superhero who has the ability to fly with the help of a [[Rocket-Pack|rocket-powered jet pack]]. Armed with her cool new gear and secret identity, Kit is ready to take flight and save the day with her gadget-minded best friend, Tesh, and airplane mechanic, Grandpa Ambrose, who join her on her epic adventures.\n\n==Background==\n===Physical appearance===\nKit is a seven year old girl who has green eyes, tan skin, and brown hair tied in pigtails. Her Rocketeer outfit includes a purple lever pilot's jacket, light purple pants with knee pads, dark grey boots tied with purple straps, and gloves. She wears her rocket pack on her back and a streamlined helmet, which features a special fin on the top.\n\n===Powers and Abilities===\n*'''[[Rocket Pack]]:''' Like the previous [[Cliff Secord|Rocketeer]], Kit uses a twin rocket-powered jet pack that allows her to fly like a rocket. It is controlled by two throttles, fitted to her gloves, and her helmet works as a rudder to help her steer. The rocket pack is known to be difficult to control, and can sometimes conk out unexpectedly.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In early news postings, she was called '''Kit Seacourt'''.\n*She is the great-granddaughter of the original Rocketeer, Cliff Secord.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nThe Rocketeer - Sereena, Kit and Dave.jpg\nThe Original Rocketeer's helmet.jpg\nFirst Flight 4.png|First time flying\nFirst Flight 7.png\nFirst Flight 8.png\nFirst Flight 9.png\nFirst Flight 11.png\nHeart of a Hero.png\nFirst Flight 15.png\nFirst Flight 16.png\nFirst Flight 5.png\nFirst Flight 18.png\nThe Rocketeer TV (39).png\nThe Rocketeer TV (30).png\nThe Rocketeer - Kit.jpg\nSongbird Soars Again (2).png\nSongbird Soars Again (6).png\nSongbird Soars Again (7).png\nThe Rocketeer TV (26).png\nThe Rocketeer TV (27).png\nThe Rocketeer TV (28).png\nThe Rocketeer TV (32).png\nThe Rocketeer TV (37).png\nThe Rocketeer TV (16).png\nKit holding a coin.jpg\nKit 3453.jpg\nKit left handed.jpg\nKit and Richard.jpg|Kit and Richard\nKit sitting with Butch Tesh and other pets.png|Kit sitting with Tesh, Butch, and other pets\nKit putting on her gloves.jpg\nRocketeer says that any time Deany wants to help, he can.jpg\nRocketeer's smiles.jpg\nKit and Tesh 8.png\nKit and Tesh 5454.png\nRocketeer has a plan to save Eddie.jpg|Rocketeer has a plan to rescue Eddie the hamster\nKit helping her mom cook.jpg\nKit climbing.jpg|Kit climbing up the ladder\nKit rubbing Butch's tummy.jpg|Kit rubbing Butch's tummy\nRocketeer 965.jpg|\"He got away.\"\nKit cute.jpg\nRocketeer and Butch.jpg|Rocketeer and her dog, Butch\n</gallery>\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nThe Rocketeer TV (1).png\nThe Rocketeer TV (3).png\nThe Rocketeer TV (4).png\nThe Rocketeer TV (5).png\nThe Rocketeer TV (6).png\nThe Rocketeer TV (7).png\nThe Rocketeer TV (8).png\nThe Rocketeer TV (9).png\nThe Rocketeer TV (10).png\nThe Rocketeer TV (11).png\nThe Rocketeer TV (14).png\nThe Rocketeer TV (17).png|\"Helmet, on.\"\nThe Rocketeer TV (18).png|\"Rocket Pack, secured.\"\nThe Rocketeer TV (19).png|\"Avionics, check.\"\nThe Rocketeer TV (20).png|\"Clear to Rocketeer!\"\n</gallery>\n\n==Miscellaneous==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nThe Rocketeer 2019 Poster.jpeg|promotional poster\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{The Rocketeer}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Seacourt, Kit}}\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Rocketeer characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Superheroes]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Scouts]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]"
