He is a talent scout.\n\n==''The Fox and the Hound 2''==\nBickerstaff visited the country fair to find some talented performers for the Grand Ole Opry. He was often accompanied by a little girl serving as his chaperone named [[Olivia Farmer]] to help him with his quest to find talented performers at the fair. The Singin' Strays hope, with their performance, to impress him and be chosen but, because of [[Dixie]]'s jealousy since she was replaced by [[Copper]] and with [[Tod]]'s help, the show is ruined and he leaves. Later on, the band tracks him down at a local diner and sings in front of him, thus, getting chosen along with their banjo player, [[Lyle Snodgrass]] to perform at the Grand Ole Opry. At the Opry, Bickerstaff enjoys the band's singing until he spots Olivia in the audience and faints on stage.\n\n==Trivia==\n*After being tossed into box of pig slump, Bickerstaff seen as a bald man in one shot.\n*Bickerstaff is often referred to and credited as Talent Scout in the movie.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nbickerstaffburn.png\nbickerstafffleas.png\nbickerstaffsnake.png|Bickerstaff squeezed by a snake\nbickerstaffcry.png\nBick.png\nbickerstaffcash.png|Bickerstaff's finally found his act\nbickerstafffaint.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Fox and the Hound}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Fox and the Hound characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Cowboys & cowgirls]]"
