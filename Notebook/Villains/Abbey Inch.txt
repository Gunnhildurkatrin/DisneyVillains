"{{Infobox character\n|name = Abbey Inch\n|image = AbbeyInch.jpg\n|films = ''[[The Parent Trap]]''\n|actress = Ruth McDevitt\n|alignment = Good\n|occupation = Head of [[Camp Inch]]\n}}'''Abbey Inch''' is the head of [[Camp Inch]] in ''[[The Parent Trap]]''.\n\nAfter [[Susan Evers]] and [[Sharon McKendrick]] got into a fight, which ruined a dance held by the camp, Abbey decided that they should share a cabin. Her reasoning was that it would either get them to get along or they\u2019d punish each other, far worse than she ever could. This led to them discovering that they are long lost twin sisters.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Inch, Abbey}}\n{{The Parent Trap}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Parent Trap characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"
