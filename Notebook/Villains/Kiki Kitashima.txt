She is one of [[Cricket Green|Cricket]] and [[Tilly Green]]'s friends.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nKiki is a very friendly and excitable young girl who is in touch with technology. She is mostly drawn to things that are bound to be big or interesting so that she can record it on her phone. She is nice nonetheless especially towards her friends. Kiki seems to spend her life around technology and was easily depressed and slightly self-deprecating when her stuff was hacked as seen in \"[[Cyberbullies]]\". With a bit of support however, she comes to her friends aid regardless of the situation.\n\n===Appearance===\nKiki is a small girl just slightly shorter than Cricket. She has violet-ish purple skin and dark purple hair that is lighter near the tips. In her first appearance in \"[[Swimming Fool]]\", the darker shade of her hair was light black. She wears a turquoise tank top,\u00a0light blue pants, and mahogany colored shoes. The only paraphernalia seen on her at all times is\u00a0a small white wristwatch.\n\n==Trivia==\n* Prior to Kiki's last name being revealed, her voice actress and the fact that she has a Japanese phone indicated her Japanese ethnicity.\n** She could be named after [[Kiki]] from ''[[Kiki's Delivery Service]]''\n** Thus making her the second Japanese character on the show, after [[Gloria Sato]].\n* Kiki's hairstyle is similar to that of [[Janna Ordonia]] from ''[[Star vs. the Forces of Evil]]''.\n** Interestingly, in Portugal, both Janna and Kiki share the same voice actress: Helena Montez.\n* Kiki is shown to possess Japanese electronics such as her 'Bintendo Twist', a parody of Nintendo Switch. Again as a nod to her ethnic origin.\n*When Kiki first appeared, her hair was light black with the tips colored light purple. Every appearance afterwards depicted her with dark purple hair with the tips still colored light purple. This would indicate that she dyes her hair.\n\n==External links==\n*{{Interwiki|https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/countryclub9732/images/6/64/Favicon.ico|bigcitygreens|Kiki Kitashima|Big City Greens Wiki}}\n\n{{Big City Greens}}\n[[id:Kiki (Big City Greens)]]\n[[Category:Big City Greens characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Japanese characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
