'''Experiment 603''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]]. He is designed to be a living laser bolt. He was captured by [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]], but was rescued in \"[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]\".\n\n==Background==\n===Physical appearance===\nZap is a neon yellow living laser whose body is only of a face and a lightning bolt-shaped tail. He has lightning-shaped antennae, dark blue eyes with lightning-shaped pupils, a round brown nose, a wide mouth with sharp teeth and a green tongue, and two brown stripes on his back. He also has an electric aura surrounding him.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nZap can hover in place, and move side to side without moving forward, similar to a helicopter. Also, like an ordinary laser bolt, he can fly and bounce off surfaces, and is capable of destroying targets at incredibly high speed.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment 603 was the 603rd genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to act as a living laser bolt. 603 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.\n\nAt an unknown point after this, Experiment 603 was activated.\n\nIn \"[[627 (episode)|627]]\", 603 attacked a farmhouse, but was defeated when [[Stitch]] trapped him in a containment orb. However, [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] and [[627]] arrived shortly after, and both easily managed to take 603 from an inattentive Stitch. 603, named Zap, was later seen multiple times flying around [[Gantu's Ship|Gantu's ship]].\n\nZap reappeared in \"[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]\", and was freed along with Gantu's other captive experiments by [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], Stitch, and several other experiments in a rescue mission.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nThe first 624 experiments, including Zap, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]] and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nZap participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]].\n\nThe Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.\n\n===''[[Stitch!]]''===\nZap made a cameo appearance in the ''Stitch!'' anime as one of the experiments in [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s [[Prison Asteroid K-37|prison cell]].\n\n==Trivia==\n*Zap was activated off-screen.\n*Zap is one of three\u00a0known limbless experiments, the other two being [[Slimy]] and [[Cloudy]].\n*Zap and [[Sparky (Lilo & Stitch)|Sparky]] are the only known experiments with primary functions directly involving electricity, and both of their names relate to electricity as well.\n*Zap, [[Remmy]], Cloudy, [[Welco]], and [[Shrink]] are the only known experiments that are always seen levitating.\n**[[Phantasmo]] and [[Witch (Lilo & Stitch)|Witch]] primarily levitate\u00a0but often possess objects or living beings to move by other means. [[Tickle-Tummy]] is also able to levitate, but has been seen bouncing as well.\n*In \"[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]\", when Lilo is updating her [[Lilo's Experiment Book|logbook of experiments]] that have found their \"one true place\", one of the photos yet to be placed in the book is Zap. However, Zap is still a prisoner of Gantu, and at the end of the episode, we see him escape with the others. Thus,\u00a0it makes no sense for Lilo to count him in the list of successfully rehabilitated experiments.\n*Zap is one of the few experiments to not appear in the group photo at the end of ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nScreenCapture 13.06.13 14-47-24.jpg\nZap_zooming_around.png\nZap_flies_through_chicken_barn.png\nScreenCapture 13.06.13 14-57-05.jpg\nScreenCapture 13.06.13 15-00-12.jpg\nZap_zooming_around_002.png\nScreenCapture 13.06.13 15-03-38.jpg\nScreenCapture 13.06.13 15-05-24.jpg\nZap_rolling_away.png\nScreenCapture 13.06.13 15-16-31.jpg\nScreenCapture 13.06.13 17-03-17.jpg\nScreenCapture 13.06.13 17-04-05.jpg\nZap_zooming_around_Gantu's_ship.png\nScreenCapture 13.06.13 20-32-51.jpg\nScreenCapture 13.06.13 21-07-43.jpg\nScreenCapture 13.06.13 21-31-05.jpg\nVlcsnap-2013-03-06-22h14m49s171.png\nVlcsnap-2013-03-23-14h37m23s239.png\nVlcsnap-2013-02-09-20h08m40s179.png\nExperiements (Snafu).jpg\nVlcsnap-2012-07-02-16h47m47s241.png\nVlcsnap-2013-02-05-12h21m38s109.png\nVlcsnap-2013-07-06-15h27m06s90.png\nVlcsnap-2013-01-16-17h39m04s2.png\nVlcsnap-2013-03-23-15h56m18s71.png\nVlcsnap-2013-12-28-20h22m17s5.png\nVlcsnap-2013-07-06-17h02m11s14.png\nVlcsnap-2013-02-09-19h54m50s54.png\nVlcsnap-2013-02-08-11h58m00s88.png\nVlcsnap-2012-08-02-20h56m43s41.png\nVlcsnap-2013-05-21-14h09m47s96.png\nVlcsnap-2013-04-03-21h41m26s43.png\nVlcsnap-2012-07-03-21h38m44s14.png\nScreenCapture 26.02.13 19-44-43.jpg\nDSA Zap.png|In [[Disney Sorcerer's Arena]]\n</gallery>\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Sorcerer's Arena Characters]]"
