She develops a deep love for [[Jesse Tuck]], a one-hundred-four-year-old boy trapped in a seventeen-year-old\u2019s body for all of eternity. A greedy man known as [[The Man in the Yellow Suit]] has a plan based on childhood stories he heard from his grandmother about a family of immortals. He set out to find them and sell the water they drank from for huge amounts of money. [[Mae Tuck]] foils his plans when she clubs him in the head with a shotgun. In the end of the film Winnie helps Mae escape from prison and chooses not to drink from the bottle but instead to die like all other mortals. In the late 1900s, Jesse rides up to the tree on a motorcycle and visits Winnie\u2019s grave under the spring.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nWinnie Foster.jpg\nWinnie Foster in the Carriage.jpg\nWinnie Foster in the Forest.jpg\ntuck-disneyscreencaps.com-5725.jpg|Winnie and Jesse's first kiss\nWinnie Foster at the Spring.jpg|Winnie at the spring\ntuck-disneyscreencaps.com-10030.jpg|Winnie's grave\nTumblr_ni11uj7BFp1qiceiuo1_1280.jpg\nTuck01.jpg\nWinnie with Mother and Yellow Man.png|Winnie with her mother and the Man in the Yellow Suit\nMV5BMGQzNGQwYjctOWM2My00OTBjLThkY2YtZWU3MDIzNGE3NjAxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTk4OTA2Nzg@__V1_.jpg\nWinnie and Tuck.png|Winnie with Jesse\n6FC68C63-CEF0-4357-880E-DD45E14CB866.jpeg|Costume sketch of Winnie\u2019s signature dress\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Foster, Winnie}}\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Tuck Everlasting characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]"
