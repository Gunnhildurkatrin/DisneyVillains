Every time whenever someone runs on the grass, he constantly tells the person to stay off, warning guests in a strict behavior.\n\n===Behind the scenes===\nSteve Nicolson makes his Disney feature film debut as the Park Keeper. As an actor, he is known for\u00a0his film performances in ''K-19: The Widowmaker''\u00a0([[2002]]),\u00a0''Johnny English''\u00a0([[2003]]), and\u00a0''Criminal''\u00a0([[2016]]).\n\n==Role in the film==\nThe Park Keeper is prominently featured as a gag character where he appears at the beginning of the film telling guests to keep off the grass. Just as [[John Banks|John]], [[Annabel Banks|Annabel]], and [[Georgie Banks]] attempt to retrieve the kite their father, [[Michael Banks|Michael]], used to own as a child, he notices this. Just as [[Jack (Mary Poppins)|Jack]] arrives, he grabs the kite to which [[Mary Poppins (character)|Mary Poppins]] arrives toward them. He later appears again during the musical number \"[[Can You Imagine That?]]\" where he appears as reminiscent of his real world version, only telling visitors to keep off the sea grass. During the end of the film, he does not notice John, Annabel, and Georgie walking on the grass.\n\n{{Mary Poppins}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Park Keeper, The}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Mary Poppins characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:English characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
