He works for the San Fransokyo Police Department.\n\n==Role in film==\nSergeant Gerson is first seen talking to [[Hiro Hamada]] about [[Yokai]] and the theft of Hiro's [[Microbots]]. But after Baymax lets out some air, as well as his battery turning low, Gerson does not take Hiro's claims too seriously anymore and before he can call his already-deceased parents, Hiro and Baymax are already out the door, taking a tape roller with them.\n\nLater on, Gerson can be seen grabbing lunch during Hiro and Baymax's first flight.\n\nWhether or not Gerson learns about the truth behind Hiro's report about Yokai is left to interpretation, although the ending credits reveal that the Big Hero 6 team had given the officer a new tape roller to replace the one that Hiro and Baymax had taken earlier (possibly as a reward for putting Yokai, later revealed to be [[Robert Callaghan]], behind bars).\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"180\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nGerson.jpg|Gerson on his computer typing every word Hiro is saying about Yokai, only believing that he is making up his story.\nSan_Fransokyo_district.jpg\nGerson_sees_Baymax.jpg\nSkeptical Gerson.jpg\nBig-Hero-6-4.png\nBig-Hero-6-48.png\nBig-Hero-6-Hans.jpg|[[Hans]] from ''[[Frozen]]'' can be seen on the wanted poster on the bulletin board.\nGerson_needs_a_gallery.jpg|Gerson's name tag.
