He is [[Taurus Bulba]]'s pet condor. The immense bird of prey played a key role in Bulba's operations, wearing a two-way TV monitor/transmitter on a collar around his neck which allowed Bulba to literally have a bird's eye view of things.\nWhile not anthropomorphic, Tantalus appears to be as intelligent as Bulba's other henchmen, serving in the role of kidnapper, scout, and interrogator (wherein he drops [[Gosalyn Mallard|Gosalyn Waddlemeyer]] from great heights repeatedly at Bulba's order).\n\nHe meets his downfall at the hands of the [[Thunderquack]], which rips out his tailfeathers during aerial combat, causing him to fall out of the sky, most likely to his death.\n==Appearances==\n*[[Darkly Dawns the Duck|Darkly Dawns the Duck (Part 1)]]\n*[[Darkly Dawns the Duck|Darkly Dawns the Duck (Part 2)]]\n\n==Trivia==\n*Tantalus' name comes from the character of the same name in Greek mythology. Tantalus cooked his own son and attempted to feed him to the gods and was punished with being forever hungry and thirsty.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nBulba6.png\nBulba9.png\n474645-vlcsnap 00287.jpg\nVlcsnap-2016-05-22-09h06m08s295.png\nVlcsnap-2016-05-22-09h07m19s811.png\nVlcsnap-2016-05-22-09h48m07s845.png\nVlcsnap-2016-05-22-09h37m32s401.png\nVlcsnap-2015-10-17-23h40m39s409.png\nVlcsnap-2015-10-17-23h41m24s320.png\nVlcsnap-2015-10-17-23h41m58s361.png\nVlcsnap-2015-10-17-23h41m32s322.png\nVlcsnap-2015-10-17-23h41m37s244.png\nVlcsnap-2015-10-17-23h42m21s790.png|Tantalus' downfall\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Darkwing Duck}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Darkwing Duck characters]]\n[[Category:Vultures]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Presumably Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]"
