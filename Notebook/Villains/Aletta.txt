Aletta would be passed down to the ownership of Cellino's daughter [[Camellia Falco]] after his death with Camellia becoming a balloonist, 19th-century aviator and the first female member of the [[Society of Explorers and Adventurers]].  After Camellia's death in 1875, Aletta would remain in the Museum of Fantastic Flight, seemingly agelessly while in the company of her mistress' ghost.\n\n== Appearances ==\n=== Soaring: Fantastic Flight ===\nAletta is seen on this attraction, flying with guests using her late-owner's <nowiki>[[Dream Flyer]]</nowiki> machines to glide through the skies.  Aletta's likeness can also be found throughout the queue for the attraction.\n\n== Trivia ==\n*Aletta's role in Soarin' replaces that traditionally occupied by [[Tinkerbell]] in [[Epcot]] and [[Disney's California Adventure]].\n*Aletta is similar to [[Duncan the Parrot|Duncan]] from [[Typhoon Lagoon]] in that they are both the avian pets of woman SEA members featured in the rides.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nCamellia main.jpg\nCamellia 01.png\nCamellia 02.jpg\nSea main.jpg\nCamellia poster.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Society of Explorers and Adventurers}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Falcons]]\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:S.E.A. characters]]\n[[Category:Soarin' characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]"
