His character appears to be modeled after old-time mobsters - more specifically, Baby Face Nelson.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nCrispy is a no-good crook who gets what he wants by acting cute, pretending to be a baby, and stealing. He also has the \"Yeah, See\" speech patterns of a 1920's gangster.\n\n===Physical Appearance===\nCrispy is a grown-up dragon who just has the size, small wings, and face of a baby dragon. His entire body is amber and his eyes are blue. Crispy's fire is green, though he often breathes smoke to look like a hatchling who hasn't gotten his fire yet.\n\n==Role in the series==\nIn \"[[Bad Little Dragon]]\", Crispy first appears after [[Princess Vivian|Vivian]] and [[Sofia the First (character)|Sofia]] found him. Because of how cute he looks, Vivian and Sofia take him back to Zumaria Castle. Vivian asks her parents if she could keep him and they say yes. Vivian mommies Crispy nonstop. [[Crackle]] later discovers that Crispy isn't a baby at all but an adult dragon who only looks like a baby due to being a midget. Crispy also reveals he plans to rob Zumaria Castle's Jewel Room and plans to get rid of Crackle. Crispy does bad stuff and Crackle gets blamed for them by Vivian. After [[Clover]] reveals Crispy's true nature to Sofia, the two confront the thieving rascal in the Jewel Room. Crispy is shocked that Sofia can understand him and locks her in the Jewel Room, but she gets out by using her shrinking ability to make herself small enough to fit through the keyhole. Underestimating Sofia becomes Crispy's downfall when Sofia chases him into Vivian and Crackle, who nabs him. A constable comes by and arrests him and takes him to a fireproof cell.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\">\nBad Little Dragon 6.png\nSofia the First - You're the Cutest Thing.jpg\nBad Little Dragon 9.jpg\nBad Little Dragon 8.jpg\nBad Little Dragon 10.jpg\nBad Little Dragon 11.jpg\nBad Little Dragon 12.jpg\nBad Little Dragon 13.jpg|Crackle captures Crispy\nFake Baby Dragon Arrseted.png\nCrispy Wanted.png|Wanted poster featuring Crispy\nCrispy Arrested.png|Crispy arrested\n</gallery>\n\n{{Sofia the First}}\n[[Category:Dragons]]\n[[Category:Sofia the First characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
