I think.\"}}'''Haya''' is a character that appears in [[The Lion Guard|''The Lion Guard'']].\n\n== Background\u00a0==\n\n=== Personality\u00a0===\nLike all of the aardwolves, Haya is best described as shy. He is logical and, like the rest of his\u00a0pack, he loves to eat\u00a0termites. He is untrusting of others once they have caused him harm or upset, and it takes a lot of persuasion in order for him to forgive.\n\n=== Physical appearance ===\nHaya is a rather stocky aardwolf, with deep grey fur and thick black stripes along his body, two down each of his forelegs, and three on the top of his head that lead up to his black mane, which starts with several tufts of vertically-standing fur and goes down his back. His inner ears are pink, several strands of fur grow up of each one. He has a dark gray mask covering his face and a long snout with a round black nose. On either side of his face, he has crescent-shaped stripes. His sclerae are yellow, with black pupils. He has a thick black tail and black paws and lower forelegs. His underbelly is gray. Two teeth protrude from his upper jaw, extending down past his lower lip.\n\n==Role in the series ==\n===[[Too Many Termites]]===\nOne night, Muhanga and Muhangus alert the [[Lion Guard]] to the presence of hyenas in their den.\n\nOnce the Guard has reached the aardvark dens, [[Kion]] steps forward, and blasts them into\u00a0the Outlands\u00a0with\u00a0the [[Roar of the Elders]].\n\nA few days after the incident, the Lion Guard enters the [[Outlands]] to apologize to the aardwolves and bring them back to the [[Pride Lands]], but the pack mistakingly believes that the Lion Guard simply wants to hurt them again. The pack races away in fear of the Lion Guard until they reach a cave, which they take shelter in.\n\nEventually, [[Reirei]] and [[Goigoi]] come by to introduce themselves to their new neighbors, Reirei assures the aardwolves that they mean no harm, and slowly earns their trust. [[Mjomba]] arrives and tells his pack that Kion wants to bring them back into the Pride Lands. Before they can leave, Reirei and Goigoi trap the aardwolves and launch an attack.\n\nLed by Kion, the Lion Guard arrives and defeats the jackals. With the Lion Guard now on pleasant terms with the aardwolves, the two groups return home to the Pride Lands, where Haya and his pack proceed to clear the kingdom of termites.\n\n{{The Lion King}}\n[[Category:The Lion Guard characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:African characters]]\n[[Category:Hyenas]]"
