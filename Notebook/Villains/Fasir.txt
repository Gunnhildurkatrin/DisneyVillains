He is a seer who hides his cycloptic nature by wearing a bandage over his eye, appearing as a blind beggar. He is the brother of the giant [[Fashoom]] and was once in love with [[Mirage (Aladdin)|Mirage]]. He helped [[Aladdin (character)|Aladdin]] and his friends in a number of episodes, often thwarting Mirage's evil plans.\n\n==History==\nFasir was the brother of [[Fashoom]]. He cast a spell on his brother by turning him into stone because he was shooting fire with his eye and causing destruction upon the land while stealing treasures from caravans. He was once in love with Mirage until she left him for her evil ways. Nevertheless, Fasir never gave up hope that someday, they would come back together again.\n\n==Roles==\nFasir appears in a total of six episodes of the [[Aladdin (TV series)|show]]. He makes his first appearance in \"[[Do the Rat Thing]]\", but he is not named or given any background information until \"[[The Prophet Motive]]\". In this episode, it is revealed that Fasir only has one eye, which could be the reason he wears a bandage over it. In \"[[Hero with a Thousand Feathers]]\", Fasir prophets that only [[Iago]] himself can defeat an ancient evil known as [[Amuk Moonrah]] that once ruled Agrabah with the help of a magical amulet. In \"[[The Sands of Fate]]\", Fasir tells Aladdin and his friends about the story of the [[Riders of Ramond]] and how their fate is sealed between their mission and the [[Marauders|marauders]] until Iago breaks the fate and the Riders finally deliver their crystal cargo to Fasir himself. The episodes \"[[Eye of the Beholder (Aladdin)|Eye of the Beholder]]\" and \"[[While the City Snoozes]]\" show that he has had dealings with Mirage and that they were once a couple. At the end of \"Eye of the Beholder,\" he tells himself that he and Mirage will get back together one day.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*\"The Prophet Motive\" was likely aired out of order since Fasir had appeared before the following episodes.\n\n{{Aladdin}}\n[[Category:Aladdin characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Greek characters]]\n[[Category:Greek Mythology]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]"
