Sir Tuxford leads the knights of [[Dunwyn Castle|Castle Dunwyn]] and is the main force that keeps [[Duke Igthorn]] and his [[Ogres]] away.\n\nHis catchphrase is often \"I'm sure I don't know, Sire.\" when questioned by King Gregor about the present situation. Despite his age and his appearance, Sir Tuxford has apprehended many troublemakers in Dunwyn, and done battle with Igthorn and his Ogres.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=center captionalign=center widths=180 spacing=small>\nAdventuresOfTheGummiBears-WhenYouWishUponAStone-SirTuxfordAndCavin.png\nBraver18.jpg\nBraver1.jpg\nBraver8.jpg\nGummibears up05.JPG\nE13_122.jpg\nAdventuresOfTheGummiBears-AHuntingWeWillGo-Runneth.png\nAdventuresOfTheGummiBears-AHuntingWeWillGo-Laughing.png\nAdventuresOfTheGummiBears-AHuntingWeWillGo-TuxfordTheStoryteller.png\ntuxford_guide.jpg\nbompi tuxford.jpg\nGummicast.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Adventures of the Gummi Bears}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tuxford}}\n[[Category:Adventures of the Gummi Bears characters]]\n[[Category:Knights]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Horsemen]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
