By the end of the episode,\u00a0An Yu\u00a0turned him back to his normal form. Eventually in \"[[A Teeny Weeny Problem]]\", An Yu decided to give him back the transforming splat in order to promote him to become the Mystery Mountain Guardian assistant.\n\n== Personality ==\n\n=== As Teeny Weeny ===\nUnlike the other [[Ninjalinos]], Teeny Weeny will be shown to be less obedient with Night Ninja at certain circumstances and will sometimes side with the\u00a0PJ Masks. It is also emphasized in \"[[Catboy and the Teeny Weeny Ninjalino]]\" that Teeny Weeny is afraid, can get lost easily at places and is shown to not understand some phrases and sentences that people say, although he can speak English properly like the other Ninjalinos.\n\nHowever, since his appearance on\u00a0Season 3, he starts to become more obedient and fully complies to Night Ninja's orders. As of that, he stopped siding with the PJ Masks for now. This lasted until the events of \"The Splat Monster\", \"[[Clash on Mystery Mountain]]\" and \"A Teeny Weeny Problem\" where he decided to turn on his master once more.\n\n=== As The Splat Monster ===\nWhen Teeny Weeny transforms into The Splat Monster, he becomes much more defiant to Night Ninja's orders and often becomes enraged and attacks Night Ninja and his fellow Ninjalinos. However, he is still friendly to An Yu and the PJ Masks when in this form.\n\n== Abilities ==\n\n=== As Teeny Weeny ===\n* '''Sticky Splat''': He is hardly shown using other weapons such as \"Sticky Splats\" until \"[[Armadylan Zen]]\".\n* '''Acrobatics''': Like the Ninjalinos, he is shown to be quite fast and agile.\n\n=== As The Splat Monster ===\n* '''Super Strength''': In his Splat Monster form, he has super strength.\n* '''Telepathically Controlled Sticky Splat''': He can also shoot red sticky splats, which he can telepathically control. Teeny Weeny can only access this form when he sneezes while holding the Mystery Mountain ritual scroll that leads to a cave containing transformation splat.\n\n== Physical appearance ==\n\n=== As Teeny Weeny ===\nTeeny Weeny is identical to the Ninjalinos, except he is smaller in size.\n\n=== As The Splat Monster ===\nIn his Splat Monster/Gigantus form, he's made of red sticky splats and has a muscular body, but Teeny Weeny Ninjalino's face can still be seen. In this form, he is once more disobedient towards Night Ninja, and won't hesitate to attack him.\n\n{{PJ Masks}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:PJ Masks characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Ninjas]]"
