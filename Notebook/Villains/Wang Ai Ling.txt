Similar to [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]]'s life, both of her parents have been deceased, and she lives with her aunt [[Wang Daiyu|Daiyu]] and older sister [[Wang Jiejie|Jiejie]]. Ai's aunt Daiyu wants her to move out of her home in the rural mountains and into the city with her. Ai's sister Jiejie works at a Chinese tea shop owned by a man named Mr. Ding. Ai has a drum instructor named [[Qian Dahu|Dahu]] who is also Jiejie's boyfriend (like [[Nani Pelekai|Nani]] with [[David Kawena|David]]).\n\nAi participates in drum practice with four other girls who are rivals (like [[Mertle Edmonds|Mertle]] and [[Elena, Teresa, and Yuki|the hula girls]] with Lilo in [[Kai\u0101ulu Hale|hula class]]).\n\nAi encountered Stitch when he was falling from the sky and Ai saw a light crashing down from her room. When she went to investigate, she saw Stitch floating towards her. After meeting Stitch, she invites him to live at home with her. She helps Stitch to find a shrine up in the mountains. Ai also helps Stitch to avoid being captured by the the Jaboodies and the Woolagongs. Ai is very knowledgeable about the [[Jumba's Chinese Experiments|Chinese mythical creatures that Jumba created]].\n\nIn episode 3 \"[[w:c:liloandstitch:Gotcha!|Gotcha!]]\", Ai saw Stitch making a replica of a city out of the things from her house and destroying it. In the same episode, Ai mimicked Stitch's taunting act in which he stands on his head with his two hands flat on the ground and shakes his rear end (just like in [[Lilo & Stitch|the original movie]]).\n\nIn episode 6 \"[[w:c:liloandstitch:The Lock|The Lock]]\", Ai tried to teach Stitch how to mountain climb.\n\nIn both episodes 10 \"[[w:c:liloandstitch:Dream On|Dream On]]\" and 11 \"[[w:c:liloandstitch:Nuo Opera|Nuo Opera]]\", Ai kissed Stitch on the head, which he doesn't like at all.\n\nIn both episodes 12 \"[[w:c:liloandstitch:Brothers|Brothers]]\" and 13 \"[[w:c:liloandstitch:Monstrosity|Monstrosity]]\", Ai screamed very loudly to get Stitch's attention when he was destroying things. In the latter episode, when Stitch grew into a giant monster and developed four laser-firing tentacles, he tried to destroy a city under construction. Ai used his love of {{WikipediaLink|Tanghulu|bingtanghulu}} to try to lure him to calm him down from his rampage. She later restored Stitch back to his original self with her friendship towards him.\n\nAi trusts Stitch to a certain degree. For example, she believes Stitch for not destroying a dragon float via fire, and the girls blame Stitch for it right before Chinese New Year.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Due to having a {{WikipediaLink|Chinese name}}, Ai's {{WikipediaLink|Chinese surname|family name}} is {{WikipediaLink|Wang (surname)|Wang}}, while her given name is Ai Ling.\n*Ai and Jiejie's relationship is similar to [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Nani Pelekai|Nani]]'s relationship.\n*She is the third human companion of Stitch in the ''Lilo & Stitch'' franchise, after Lilo Pelekai and [[Yuna Kamihara]]. \n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nAi official artwork.jpg|Official artwork\nai artwork waifu2x.png|Variant official art with Ai wearing a hoodie\nStitch & Ai title characters.jpg|Official artwork of the titular characters\nStitch & Ai English title card.png|Ai with Stitch in the title card\nAi Stitch & Ai.jpg\nJiejie 2.png\nJiejie 13.png\nMeiying 2.png\nMeiying 8.png\nMeiying 11.png\nMeiying 12.png\nAi_early_design_by_miss_Fang.jpg|Ai early design by miss Fang\nAi early design by Mr.Bao.jpg|Ai early design by Mr.Bao\nAi early design by Mr.Wang.jpg|Ai early design by Mr.Wang\nAi early design in green.jpg|Ai early design in green\nAi early design in pink.jpg|Ai early design in pink\nAi early design with different color.jpg|Ai early design with different color\nAi early design with drum.jpg|Ai early design with drum\nAi artwork 1.jpg|Ai artwork 1\nAi artwork 2.jpg|Ai artwork 2\nAi artwork 3.jpg|Ai artwork 3\nAi artwork 4.jpg|Ai artwork 4\nAi artwork 5.jpg|Ai artwork 5\nAi artwork 6.jpg|Ai artwork 6\nAi drawing guide.jpg|Ai drawing guide\n</gallery>\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Orphans]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Chinese characters]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Cousins]]"
