In contrast, he is an intelligent pigeon in charge of delivering the Beast's messages to the village for placing orders or anything similar. While it is possible that he was already a pigeon before the [[Enchantress]] placed the spell on the castle, him previously being a human servant may be the only possible explanation of his capability of understanding English with no apparent problem. (But then again, anything is possible in fairy tales...)\n\n\n{{Beauty and the Beast}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Beauty and the Beast characters]]\n[[Category:Servants]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Pigeons]]"
