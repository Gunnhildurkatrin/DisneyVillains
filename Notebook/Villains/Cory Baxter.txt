He and Raven often argue, but in the long run, they care deeply for each other. Even as he gets older, he claims that playing pranks on Raven is one of his guilty pleasures. Cory has two best friends, William and Larry. Together, the 3 boys form the band \"Cory and the Boys\", with Cory as the drummer and lead singer, while Larry is the guitarist. William starts out playing the clarinet, and then plays the keyboard. The band has one song: \"''Feelin' the Love''.\" Cory is an aspiring businessman (as he is shown to be obsessed with money, and often creates \"get-rich-quick\" schemes behind his parents' backs, in which he always gets into trouble). Cory also has a close relationship with his pet rat, Lionel. Earlier in the series, he had a crush on Chelsea. His catchphrase is ''\"Cha-ching\"''. He and Victor are the main characters in the ''TSR'' spin-off series ''[[Cory in the House]]''. He is mentioned, not by name, in ''[[Raven's Home]]'' by Raven in the episode American Torah Story.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nCory is Raven's younger brother. He and Raven often argue, but in the long run, they care deeply for each other. Even as he gets older, he claims that playing pranks on Raven is one of his guilty pleasures.\n\nCory has two best friends, William and Larry. Together, the 3 boys form the band \"Cory and the Boys\", with Cory as the drummer and lead singer, while Larry is the guitarist. William starts out playing the clarinet, and then plays the keyboard. The band has two songs: \"Feelin' the Love\" and \"Loving the Feeling\".\n\nCory is also shown to be an aspiring businessman/entrepreneur; thus, he is shown to be obsessed with money. Often, he creates \"get-rich-quick\" schemes behind his parents' backs, in which he always gets into trouble. Cory also has a close relationship with his pet rat, Lionel.\n\nIn the first season, when he was younger, he was shown to have had an obsessive crush on Chelsea. As the series progressed, he grew out of his crush and began to think of Chelsea as dumb and annoying - very unlike his old self. Regardless, he is still nice to her.\n\nHis catchphrase is ''\"Cha-Ching\"''.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nCory is African American with almond-shaped eyes and has a shaved head.\n\n===Age===\n*Season 1: 10-11\n*Season 2: 11-12\n*Season 3: 12-13\n*Season 4: 13-14\n*''Cory in The House'': 14-15\n\n===School Year===\n*Season 1: 4th Grade\n*Season 2: 5th Grade\n*Season 3: 6th Grade\n*Season 4: 7th Grade\n*''Cory in The House:'' 8-9th Grade\n\n==\"Coming, Daddy!\"==\nHe usually looks to his dad for advice. Cory occasionally cooks up various \"get-rich-quick\" schemes, all of which end badly. He plays the drums and has a great sense of rhythm, which is why he is part of the band DC3 founded by Newt, Cory, and Meena., and they both are always getting into some crazy situation, but in the end, they find a way out of it. Cory lives with his dad Victor Baxter and is best friends with Newt Livingston and Meena Paroom. Cory finds immense pleasure in committing tax fraud. At one point in the series, Cory flees from the state of Oklahoma due to being sentenced with execution for 12 accounts of arson.\n\n==Relationship==\n[[Meena Paroom]] - Cory is friends with her. He used to have a crush on her, but later admitted that he and Meena were just friends and said \"Being friends feels, just right\".\n\n[[Sophie Martinez]] - Cory often is irritated with the President's daughter Sophie Martinez, because of her two-facedness. She sometimes gets him into big trouble or annoys him.\n\nCandy Smiles - Candy used to be just a cheerleader who had a crush on Cory. But then Meena helped set them up and they started going out. She keeps calling him \"C-Bear\" which irritates him.\n\n==Catchphrases==\n*\"Coming Daddy!\"\n*\"You Know How I Do.\"\n*\"Dang!\"\n*\"Daddy No!\"\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nCory-house-400-010507.jpg\nThats So Raven - Cast- Promotional Image.jpg\nThat's So Raven - Victor, Eddie, Raven, Cory and Chelsea.jpg\nThat's So Raven - Baxter Family 2.jpg\nThat's So Raven - Victor, Eddie, Raven, Cory and Chelsea 3.jpg\nThat's So Raven - Baxter Family.jpg\nThat's So Raven - Victor, Eddie, Raven, Cory and Chelsea 2.jpg\nThat's So Raven - Baxter Family 3.png\nCory in the House - Cast.jpg\nCory in the House - 1x16 - That's So in the House - Photography - Cory, Victor and Raven.jpg\nThat's So Raven - New Room.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*[[w:c:thatssoraven:Cory Baxter|That's So Raven Wiki: Cory Baxter]]\n*[[w:c:coryinthehouse:Cory Baxter|Cory in the House Wiki: Cory Baxter]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{That's So Raven}}\n{{Cory in the House}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Baxter, Cory}}\n[[Category:Cory in the House characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:That's So Raven characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Uncles]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
