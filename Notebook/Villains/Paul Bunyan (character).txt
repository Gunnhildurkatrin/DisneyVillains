In \"Ask Von Drake\", he was mentioned in the song [[The Ludwig Von Drake Song]].\n\nIn the ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'' episode \"[[Greece Lightning]]\", the gang races past a pancake restaurant with the slogan \"Paul Bunyan\u2019s! Where the food is good (but not too good, eh).\" Two statues of Paul Bunyan and Babe can also be seen at the entrance of the restaurant.\n\nIn ''[[Bolt (film)|Bolt]]'', an image of Paul Bunyan & Babe the Blue Ox appeared on the Waffle World U.S.A. Map.\n\nIn ''[[Gravity Falls]]'', a statue of him appears in the theme song of the show, and during [[Weirdmageddon (event)|Weirdmageddon]], the statue is brought to life and walks around town.\n\n==Trivia==\n*As said in the [[Paul Bunyan (song)|song]], he is described as \"63 axe handles high\". As the average axe handle is about 18 inches long (45.72&nbsp;cm), that would make him about 94.5 feet (about 29 meters) tall. As a baby, the choir who sang him to sleep said he was \"10 axe handles high\". Paul being 63 axe handles high is further confirmed in ''[[American Legends]]'' by [[James Earl Jones]].\n*According to James Earl Jones in American Legends, Paul was also as strong as 10 grizzlies.\n*In ''[[Once Upon a Time]]'', Paul Bunyan didn't appear. However, an illustration represents him in the second tome of fairy-tales found by Henry Mills and Violet.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nWatch Tall Tale.mp4 003551080.png|Bunyan in ''Tall Tales''\nPaulbunyan2.jpg|Paul with [[Babe the Big Ox|Babe]]\nTumblr lvjiy7FJ8B1r3jmn6o1 1280.png\nTumblr mc9z5gdpQS1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\nPaul Bunyan Singing.jpg\nPaul bunyan 15large.jpg\nPaul bunyan 13large.jpg\nPaul bunyan 11large.jpg\nPaul bunyan 10large.jpg\nPaul bunyan 8large.jpg\nPaul Bunyan.jpg\nPaul Bunyan's Pancake Haus.jpg\nPaul-bunyan-01.jpg\n11538447 1.jpg\nTve19565-19580801-2244.jpg\nPaul-bunyan.jpg\nPaul Bunyan2-585x420.jpg\n60.PNG\nPaulbunyan.JPG\nPaulbunyanhouseofmouse.JPG\nPaul Bunyan & Babe Clipart.png\nOpening_lumberjack.png\n</gallery>\n\n===Spoofs===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nGeniepaulbunyan-1-.jpg|[[Genie]] as Paul\nte12.jpg|Genie as Paul again\ngeniepaul.jpg|Genie as Paul again in another ''[[Aladdin (TV series)|Aladdin]]'' episode\n</gallery>\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bunyan, Paul}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Phineas and Ferb characters]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Gravity Falls characters]]\n[[Category:Once Upon a Time characters]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Paul Bunyan]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]"
