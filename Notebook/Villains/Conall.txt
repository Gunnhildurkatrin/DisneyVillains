He is a male fairy who saves Maleficent from drowning, and reintroduces her to other fairies like herself.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nStrong, fearless, heroic and kind, Conall is one of the leaders of the [[Dark Fey]], a band of winged creatures exiled from the human world, who rescues and befriends [[Maleficent]]. Having observed the dark fairy for some time, he is an advocate for peace between men and [[Fairies (Maleficent)|fairies]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thedisneyblog.com/2019/09/19/disneys-maleficent-mistress-of-evil-character-descriptions-and-new-trailer/|title=Disney\u2019s Maleficent: Mistress of Evil character descriptions and new trailer|website=The Disney Blog|date=[[September 19]], [[2019]]}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Maleficent: Mistress of Evil]]''===\nWhen a wounded Maleficent falls into the ocean, she is rescued by a mysterious winged creature who turns out to be Conall. He takes her to a cavern where fairies like herself have been in hiding and discusses with [[Borra]] that the projectile that struck Maleficent was fired by [[Gerda]] in [[Ulstead]]. As Borra aggressively prepares for war, Conall denies because the humans who face them will always win against them. As Conall takes Maleficent to explore the sacred world around the Fey, he explains that his species hid far away from mortal humans who have always been planning to hunt them while many others are lost, explaining that the sacred realm is the his species' only safe refuge.\n\nBecause Maleficent's magic is so powerful believing her magic can help save the Dark Fey from extinction, Conall (along with Borra) believes she is instrumental in ending the conflict with humans, either by peace or war. When Maleficent spies on Ingrith's henchmen arriving to take out the Dark Fey, Conall arrives alongside her and Maleficent explains that this is the spot where Dark Fey are killed by heroic humans. During this moment, he is mortally wounded by a weapon aimed at Maleficent from [[Gerda]] at [[Queen Ingrith]]'s orders while trying to protect Maleficent while Borra arrives to attack the soldiers and afterwards, Borra carries an injured Conall. Afterwards, he succumbs to his injuries and is buried in the cavern where he is laid to rest. Afterwards, Borra leads a war against humans avenging Conall's death as the Dark Fey prepare for war as the Fey arrive at Ulstead to fight back. Maleficent then spends her last moments with a dying Conall, telling her to remember who she is just as Conall disintegrates.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nMaleficent Mistress of Evil poster (2).jpg\nMaleficent Mistress of Evil - Conall.jpg\nMaleficent Mistress of Evil - Conall 2.jpeg\nMaleficent Mistress of Evil - International Poster 2.jpg\nMaleficent Mistress of Evil - Other Fairies.png\nMaleficent Mistress of Evil (67).png\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n{{Sleeping Beauty}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Fairies]]\n[[Category:Maleficent characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]"
