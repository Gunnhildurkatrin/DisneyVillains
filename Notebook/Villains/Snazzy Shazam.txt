However all was in vain as the trophy went to the presenter, for boring all a hundred and fifty people in the auditorium to sleep. Unlike Hildy, Snazzy appears to take losing well at times and turns Hildy into a squid for the second time.\n\nHildy mention's Snazzy in the\u00a0episode \"The 8th D\" and makes her second appearance in the episode \"[[Knick Knack Paddy Whack]]\" where she shows off the new cloak she won in a contest, a cloak that Hildy wanted to win.\n\nSnazzy was in the Ultimate Supreme Sorceress Pageant along with Hildy in the episode \"Hildyrella\". As always the two witches were determined to beat one another and Snazzy was sure to win the pageant and make Hildy look like a loser. When Happy, disguised as a judge asked her what would make her extra happy, It is revealed she desires world domination. Snazzy as well as Hildy was annoyed when she lost the Pageant to Hildy's fairy godmother.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\">\nSleepytime-4.png|Snazzy on the news\nSnazzy-Shazam-1.png\nSnazzy-Shazam-2.png\nSnazzy-Shazam-3.png\nSnazzy-Shazam-4.png\nSnazzy-Shazam-5.png\nSnazzy-Shazam-6.png|\"Here's looking at you, squid.\"\nHildy in a cloak 4.png|Melted Snazzy\nHildy in a cloak 1.png|\"Oh Hildy I wish I was you.\"\nKnick Knack Paddy Whack 24.JPG|\"I bet you wish you were me right now. bye, bye.\"\nKnick Knack Paddy Whack 21.JPG|\"How do you like my new cloak?\"\nKnick Knack Paddy Whack 23.JPG|Snazzy laughing\nCat-on-a-Hot-Grim-Roof-22.png\nCat-on-a-Hot-Grim-Roof-4.png\nCat-on-a-Hot-Grim-Roof-2.png|Showing off her black cat\n</gallery>\n{{The 7D}}\n[[Category:Witches]]\n[[Category:The 7D characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
