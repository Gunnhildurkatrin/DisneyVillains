He seems to have some authority, as he is able to halt the tournament when a boy constantly called [[Arthur Pendragon|Wart]] pulls the [[Sword in the Stone (object)|sword from the stone]].\n\nThe other knights initially try to force Wart to repeat the feat. However, [[Sir Kay|Kay]] and several other knights push him aside, under the mistaken belief that anyone can remove the sword a second time. However, both Sir Bart and [[Sir Pellinore]] stand up on behalf of Wart and allow the boy to successfully remove the sword, which reveals him as the rightful king of England.\n\nSir Bart asks [[Sir Ector]], Wart's foster father, for the boy's name. After learning that Wart's proper name is Arthur, he leads the other knights into cheering on for Arthur as their new king.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nSword-in-stone-disneyscreencaps.com-8698.jpg|\"[[Sword in the Stone (object)|The sword in the stone]]?\"\nSword-in-stone-disneyscreencaps.com-8703.jpg|\"It can't be!\"\nSword-in-stone-disneyscreencaps.com-8711.jpg|\"Hold everything!
