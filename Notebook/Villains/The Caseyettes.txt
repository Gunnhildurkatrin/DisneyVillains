All nine of the daughters (which includes a set of twins and a set of triplets) all look identical to their mother, with the only real physical differences between the nine sisters being their hairstyles and their heights.\n\n\n\nThe names of the twins (the second-oldest daughter and the third-from-oldest daughter), the second-youngest daughter and the third-from-youngest daughter are never revealed -- but the daughters whose names are revealed are Patsy (the oldest daughter), Colleen (the youngest daughter) and the triplets, who're named Kim (the fourth-from-oldest daughter), Peg (the middle child of the nine daughters) and Jan (the fourth-from-youngest daughter).\n\nThe daughters are first featured in [[Casey Bats Again|'''''Casey Bats Again''''']] -- after Casey has lost the game from the previous short, his wife (known only as \"Mrs. Casey\") reveals that she's going to have a baby (specifically their first child). Excited by this news, Casey hopes to have a son in order to groom him and have him carry on his legacy (and hopefully redeem his reputation) as a baseball player -- and while they do manage to have a total of nine kids (through six different pregnancies), all nine of their kids end up being girls.\n\nCasey's initially dismayed at not having at least one son -- however, all nine of his daughters prove to be excellent baseball players, and Casey's friends point out that his daughters could still carry on his legacy (and potentially redeem his reputation) as a baseball player. Realizing this, Casey forms a baseball consisting of his daughters (now collectively referred to as \"The Caseyettes\").\n\nIn the end, the Caseyettes ultimately redeem their dad's reputation as a baseball player.\n==Patsy (Oldest)==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nFullscreen capture 4122013 13900 PM.bmp.jpg|Patsy as a toddler\nFullscreen capture 4122013 14006 PM.bmp.jpg|Patsy doing the dishes\nFullscreen capture 4122013 14508 PM.bmp.jpg|Patsy relaxing before it's her turn to bat\nFullscreen capture 4122013 14434 PM.bmp.jpg|Patsy at homeplate\nFullscreen capture 4122013 13530 PM.bmp.jpg|Patsy ready to hit the ball\nFullscreen capture 4122013 13245 PM.bmp.jpg|Patsy with four of her sisters\nCasey 8.jpg|Patsy headshot\n</gallery>\n\n==The Twins (Second oldest)==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nFullscreen capture 4122013 13501 PM.bmp.jpg|The Twins relaxed and ready to play baseball\nthe twins.jpg|The Twins in their red dresses\nFullscreen capture 4122013 20503 PM.bmp.jpg|One of the Twins doing chores (Purple dress)\nFullscreen capture 4122013 14013 PM.bmp.jpg|The other Twin sliding into a pretend homeplate\nCasey.jpg|First Twin\nCasey 5.jpg|Second Twin\n</gallery>\n\n==Kim, Peg, and Jan (Triplets and third oldest)==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nFullscreen capture 4122013 13508 PM.bmp.jpg|Kim on first\nFullscreen capture 4122013 23334 PM.bmp.jpg|Peg on second\nFullscreen capture 4122013 14416 PM.bmp.jpg|Jan on third\nFullscreen capture 4122013 23252 PM.bmp.jpg|Kim, Peg and Jan in their younger days\n</gallery>\n\n==Coleen (Youngest)==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nFullscreen capture 4122013 15951 PM.bmp.jpg|Coleen on the field\nFullscreen capture 4122013 13931 PM.bmp.jpg|Coleen's younger days (Pink dress)\nFullscreen capture 4122013 13459 PM.bmp.jpg|Coleen drinking milk\nFullscreen capture 4122013 20503 PM.bmp.jpg|Coleen doing chores with her sister\n</gallery>\n\n==The Caseyettes!==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nRecently Updated2.jpg|The Caseyettes' younger days\nFullscreen capture 4122013 13541 PM.bmp.jpg|(Front left) The second youngest, (Front right) The Thrid Youngest, (Top) Jan\ncaseyettes.jpg|(Left to Right) The third youngest, Jan, Coleen, one of the Twins\ncaseyettes 1.jpg\nVarios cartoon en house of mouse.PNG\nTumblr mgj4seGmpM1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\nTumblr m33nnyisxL1r3jmn6o1 1280.png\nHouse of Mouse Episo 001128.jpg\nLN(3).png\n</gallery>\n\n===Concept Art===\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nDisney's Casey at the Bat - Caseyettes Concept Art by Fred Moore - 3.jpg|Conceptual sketch of Jan by Fred Moore.\nDisney's Casey at the Bat - Caseyettes Concept Art by Fred Moore - 2.jpg|Conceptual sketch of Coleen by Fred Moore.\nDisney's Casey at the Bat - Caseyettes Concept Art by Fred Moore - 1.jpg|Conceptual sketch of Patsy by Fred Moore.\nDisney's Casey at the Bat - Caseyettes Concept Art by Retta Scott - 2.jpg|Concept art of both the Caseyettes with Coleen being a happy bat-girl and Patsy being sad by [[Retta Scott]].\nDisney's Casey at the Bat - Caseyettes Concept Art by Retta Scott - 1.jpg|Concept art of the Caseyettes by [[Retta Scott]].\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Caseyettes}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
