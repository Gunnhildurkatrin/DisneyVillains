He is the leader of a band of dogs called the \"Singin' Strays\".\n\n==Role in the film==\nCash is the leader of the \"[[Singin' Strays]]\" group, and from the very beginning of the movie it seems to be that he doesn't get along with [[Dixie]] very well. They get into an argument after he fires her and it spirals to the point where he asks [[Copper]] to join into the group, causing a gap to form between Copper and his best friend, [[Tod]].\n\nAfter talking with Dixie, Tod accidentally lets out a secret of Copper's that eventually leads to mass chaos during the fair, eventually leading Copper to get kicked out. Cash's band members feel sorry about it, so they end up splitting apart the band.\n\nIn the end, though, Cash's band all comes together, and Tod and Copper make amends.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nSinging-Strays.jpg\nThe-fox-and-the-hound-2-58bfe36b62b76.jpg\npic_detail4d72a93084ae6.png\nchar_34379.jpg\nCash-from_Fox_and_the_Hound_2.jpg\nFox Hound 2 Screenshot 0584.jpg\nFox Hound 2 Screenshot 0529.jpg\nFox-hound2-disneyscreencaps.com-4347.jpg\nFox Hound 2 Screenshot 1725.jpg\nFox_Hound_2_Screenshot_1759.jpg\ncopperandthesingingstrays.jpg|Cash singing with Copper and the Singin' Strays\nFox-hound2-disneyscreencaps.com-6940.jpg\n4641_4.jpg|Cash with Dixie\nFox-hound2-disneyscreencaps.com-7253.jpg\nFox-hound2-disneyscreencaps.com-7019.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Some fans speculated Cash to be a main antagonist for firing Dixie, and caring about his glory.\n**His name also supports the fact about how he takes credit for himself.\n*Cash is clearly named after the legendary country singer, Johnny Cash.\n*He is the only animated character Patrick Swayze voiced. \n\n{{The Fox and the Hound}}\n[[es:Cash]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:The Fox and the Hound characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Deuteragonists]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Tritagonists]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
