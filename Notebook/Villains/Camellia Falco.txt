She would participate in S.E.A.'s tradition of displaying expedition paddles at the Tropical Hideaway, with hers coming from an 1831 trip down the Zambezi River.\n\nAvidly interested in advancing human flight, she was a hot air balloon traveler and would also develop the Dream Flyer, a glider inspired by the designs of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. Dying in 1875, her spirit would linger in the halls of the Museum of Fantastic Flight and during a special retrospective of her life held in 1901, her spirit would invite visitors to take a flight of fancy aboard the Dream Flyers.\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n=== Soaring: Fantastic Flight ===\nCamellia's ghost appears in the queue for this attraction, arranging guests to ride on her Dream Flyers.  Portraits and other references to her can be found throughout the queue as-well.\n\n=== [[The Tropical Hideaway]] ===\nShe was first referenced on one of the S.E.A. member paddles featured at [[Disneyland]]'s Tropical Hideaway.  This paddle commemorating her 1831 river-journey on the Zambezi River.\n\n== Trivia ==\n\n*Camellia assumes the role of [[Patrick (Soarin')|Patrick]] from the original Soarin' attractions.\n*Camellia is similar to the character of [[Mary Oceaneer|Captain Mary Oceaneer]] as they are both women who were members of the society and more focused on technological innovation and sciences than they were colonial theft or colonization.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\n\nCamellia main.jpg|Family portrait\nCamellia 01.png|A young Camellia with her father\nCamellia 02.jpg|Camellia with her hot air balloon and falcon\nSea main.jpg|Camellia's induction into S.E.A.\nCamellia poster.jpg|Poster for the Museum of Fantastic Flight's retrospective\n\n</gallery>\n\n{{Society of Explorers and Adventurers}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Falco, Camellia}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]\n[[Category:S.E.A. characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Spirits]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Soarin' characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]"
