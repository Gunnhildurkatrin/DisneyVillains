He applied this same strict attitude when he was taking care of the Plummer kids as he thought that they needed it, only to later regret doing so and became kinder to them and helped them with their recent problems.\n\n==Role in the film==\nShane's mother walked out on him when he was little. His father, a Spec Ops soldier, enrolled him into military school when he was eight, which he has always reckoned was due to how his father liked the life of a soldier more than that of a parent. One day, he got a letter that his father had been killed in action. He never talked to anyone about how he felt following this as he thought it as letting his father down.\n\nSeveral years later, Shane became a lieutenant in the Navy SEALs. He led and choreographed several rescue missions and snatch-and-grabs from all around the world. One of his latest missions was to rescue Professor Howard Plummer, who'd been kidnapped by Serbian rebels. After he and his men took out the rebels, Shane was able to get Howard to their way out. Unfortunately, he later found the crew of the helicopter they were using to escape dead and was too late to save Howard before he himself got shot and injured. This ended up with him being in the hospital for two months.\n\nAfter being released, Shane is told by his boss, [[Captain Bill Fawcett]], that Howard was working on the nuclear code scrambler GHOST. This was maybe why the Serbian rebels kidnapped him as they may have thought he had the GHOST on him. Bill said that his boss, Admiral Blair, was contacted by Howard's widow, [[Julie Plummer|Julie]], as she thought the GHOST was in her house. Bill had Shane take care of the house and the Plummer kids, [[Zoe Plummer|Zoe]], [[Seth Plummer|Seth]], [[Lulu Plummer|Lulu]], [[Peter Plummer|Peter]] and [[Tyler Plummer|Tyler]], while he and Julie were dealing with a safety deposit box. Unfortunately, Shane didn't get on so well with the kids because of how he thought they weren't disciplined and Zoe and Seth didn't like his strict militaristic attitude.\n\nShane was soon able to get on the kids' good sides after he protected them from a couple of intruders after the GHOST, and agreed to listen to them if they listened to him. He then proceeded to help them out \u2013 Zoe with her driving test, Lulu and her Fireflies troop with self-defence against another one, the Bear Troop, that was bullying them, and Seth with a production of ''The Sound of Music'' that he was in. Shane also able to find the GHOST, and greeted Bill and Julie after they returned from getting the safety deposit box. While being congratulated by Bill, he and Shane ended up at gunpoint by the Plummers' North Korean neighbors, [[Mr. & Mrs. Chun]]. This led him to realize that Bill was a double agent after the GHOST.\n\nShane was later able to get the GHOST after being forced to at gunpoint by Bill. He and Julie were then able to knock Bill and Mrs. Chun out, and also help to take down Mr. Chun. After the GHOST was successfully retrieved, Shane ended up changing careers and later became the school wrestling coach.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nShane Wolfe.jpg\nShane Wolfe Riding a Bike.jpg\nShane Wolfe with a Diaper.jpg\nShane Wolfe with Duck.jpg\nPac-01.jpg\nPac-02.jpg\nPac-03.jpg\nPac-05.jpg\nPac-06.jpg\nPac-07.jpg\nPac-08.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wolfe, Shane}}\n\n{{The Pacifier}}\n[[Category:Soldiers]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Military characters]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:The Pacifier characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Martial Artists]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Coaches]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Lieutenants]]"
