Ted is the older brother of [[Fred Bedderhead]].\n\n==Role in the film==\nIn the film, he is the only who despises the idea of getting the band back together. He claims he was the reason they stayed together while the others were drinking ([[Zeb Zoober|Zeb]]), blubbering ([[Tennessee O'Neal|Tennessee]]), or staring into space ([[Fred Bedderhead|Fred]]). He claims that they never thanked him for that. He also lied saying he was still rich, but in reality, he spent all of it, he has a job singing at weddings and children's birthday parties, and he lives with [[Elton John]] as a neighbor and gardener. Thanks to Beary, he remembers why he became a Country Bear in the first place and is willing to save the beloved [[Country Bear Hall]].{{DEFAULTSORT:Bedderhead, Ted}}\n\n{{The Country Bears}}\n[[Category:Bears]]\n[[Category:Country Bear characters]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Country Bears]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]"
