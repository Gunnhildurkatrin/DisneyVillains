"{{Infobox character\n|name = Pierre\n|image =Pierre.png \n|films = ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]''\n|voice = [[Frank Welker]]\n|appearance = Pink\n|species = Pig\n|alignment = Good\n|friends = [[Belle]], [[Maurice]]\n|enemies = [[Gaston]]\n|quote = \"Oink!\"}}'''Pierre''' was the pet pig of [[Belle]] and [[Maurice]].\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Beauty and the Beast]]''===\nPierre only appears very briefly in the film ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'' and is not actually named. After Belle opens her door behind her and causes [[Gaston]] to fall into a mud swamp while rejecting his wedding proposal, the pig rises up after Gaston lifts his head out of the mud pool, falling off just as Gaston's head emerges. After Gaston, in anger over Belle humiliating him, throws [[LeFou]] in the mud, Pierre oinks with LeFou in agreement after the latter says, in reference to Gaston's reaction to the humiliation, \"Touchy!\" He never appears for the rest of the film.\n\n===''[[The New Adventures of Beauty and the Beast]]''===\nPierre was given a slightly more major role in the first issue of New Adventures of Disney's Beauty and the Beast by [[Disney Comics]], specifically in the story arc \"Bothered.\" In it, Pierre was attached to a new machine Maurice was working on called an automated truffle locator. According to Maurice when Belle asked, Pierre acted as a key component to the device, acting as the \"sensor\" so to speak for the device for detecting truffles. Maurice then briefly told Pierre jokingly that Belle considers him no different than the pig after Belle, when refusing to go outside to play, implied that she viewed all men as being pigs. Pierre, alongside the truffle locator, was later instrumental in saving Belle after she was trapped in a cellar by both boys playing pirates and a newly-arrived bear (the latter was implied to be a disguise for the [[Enchantress]]). The comic was the source of his name.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Pierre being on top of Gaston's head when he emerges from the mud pond is a reference to the term \"pigheaded\", which is a term for someone who is extremely stubborn to the point of being stupid. This is fitting for Gaston later in the film, as Belle's rejection of his marriage proposal makes him obstinately fixated on still marrying her, regardless of her refusals and the humiliation he faces by her saying no.\n\n{{Beauty and the Beast}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Pierre}}{{DEFAULTSORT:Pierre}}\n[[Category:Beauty and the Beast characters]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Pigs]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Pets]]"
