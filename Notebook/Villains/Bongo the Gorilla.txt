He sees who comes into there, letting people in with the password \"[[Walt Disney|Walt]] sent me\". Dedicated to his job, he makes sure people don't sneak backstage to bother the performers in their dressing rooms, especially [[Jessica Rabbit]]. He is seen again in the deleted scene, where he knocks Eddie out cold for sneaking back into her dressing room. He is supposedly a minion of the dastardly [[Judge Doom]]. Later, at the end of the film, he is seen at the Acme factory, celebrating the Toons' victory over Doom, while possibly reformed.\n\n==Disney Parks==\nBongo can be seen and heard in the queue line of [[Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin]] when passing by the Ink and Paint Club door. He opens the window like he does in the film and says one of several different phrases, such as \"If you don't know the password, you ain't comin' in. So, amscray!\" and \"Who do you think you are? [[Mickey Mouse]]?\".\n\n==Trivia==\n*Bongo's name is not confused with [[Bongo the Bear]].\n*He resembles Conga the Ape from ''[[Wikipedia:Banjo-Kazooie|Banjo-Kazooie]]''.\n*Bongo made a cameo appearance in the ''[[Marsupilami (TV series)|Marsupilami]]'' episode \"[[Prime Mates Forever]]\".\n*Morgan Deare, the actor who voices this character, also portrays a live-action character, an editor who works out the moviola alongside [[R.K. Maroon]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nrogerrabbit-disneyscreencaps.com-1564.jpg\nrogerrabbit-disneyscreencaps.com-1578.jpg\nrogerrabbit-disneyscreencaps.com-1598.jpg|\"Wise ass!\"\nrogerrabbit-disneyscreencaps.com-2354.jpg|\"What do you think you're doin', chump?\"\nrogerrabbit-disneyscreencaps.com-2368.jpg|Bongo throwing Eddie out\nrogerrabbit-disneyscreencaps.com-2387.jpg|\"And don't let me catch your peepin' face around here again!\"\nSg25.jpg|A Bongo the Gorilla prototype or lookalike among the spectators in [[Sport Goofy in Soccermania]]\nbongothegorilla.JPG|Bongo as he appears in [[Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin]]\nWho Framed Roger Rabbit - Bongo Concept Sketch with Eddie.jpg|Concept sketch of Bongo by Andreas Deja along with Eddie Valiant.\nVlcsnap-2015-05-09-00h31m12s403.png|Bongo in ''[[Marsupilami (TV series)|Marsupilami]]''\n</gallery>\n\n{{Who Framed Roger Rabbit}}\n[[Category:Who Framed Roger Rabbit characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Gorillas]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Touchstone characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Animated characters in live-action films]]\n[[Category:Marsupilami characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]"
