She has lots of accessories, including outfits appropriate to challenging careers such as law enforcement, medicine, and aerospace, and lives in Sunnyvale, \"in the middle of America.\"\n\nAs Casey Stuart is preparing to resurrect her mother, Drew stops by to give her the doll for her birthday and uses the hairbrush to brush the doll's hair. With strands from the doll remaining on the brush as Casey utters the incantation, the magic acts on the doll rather than Casey's mother, and Casey wakes up the next morning to find Eve in bed with her in full-size human form. Casey is upset by this, but Eve is excited about being human. Over the next few days, Eve buys clothes at the local shopping mall, uses her police training to stop a truck that almost runs Casey over, smells and eats for the first time, tries to do secretarial work, sings her theme song, and almost sets the Stuarts' kitchen on fire. She also helps Casey cope with the loss of her mother. Meanwhile, Casey discovers that she needs the second volume of the magic book to reverse Eve's spell.\n\nBy the time the magic book arrives at the local bookstore, Casey has decided she likes Eve. Unfortunately, Eve has been getting homesick. Discouraged by her difficulties in being human and worried about being discontinued by Marathon, Eve decides to undo the spell herself. After buying the book and saying good-bye to Ben at Casey's championship game, she goes to Sunnyvale, a specially decorated room at Marathon headquarters, and recites the incantation. When Casey and Ben arrive, she tearfully bids them farewell and turns back into a doll. Sometime later, with the lessons learned from her experiences in the human world, she becomes a popular toy again.\n\n==[[Life-Size 2]]==\nEve makes an appearance in the second film when [[Eve (Life-Size 2)|Eve A4114]] calls and tells her that Marathon Toys has decided to discontinue the Eve doll. Eve tells Eve A4114 to ensure that she helps Grace and saves the Eve doll from cancellation.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\n\nEve (Full scale).jpg|Promotional image of Eve as a human\nEve Doll.jpg|Eve as a doll\nEve's Transformation\n\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]\n[[Category:Dolls]]\n[[Category:Toys]]\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Magical Objects]]\n[[Category:Created by Magic]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Life-Size characters]]"
