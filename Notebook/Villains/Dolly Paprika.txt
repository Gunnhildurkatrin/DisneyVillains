At first she is only briefly mentioned in the second Duck Avenger story by Guido Martina, until Marco Gervasio creates her a background.\n\nDolly Paprika's real name is Dolly Duck, a rich lady who, tired of the aristocrats and their snobbish ways, decides to follow Fantomius' steps. This doesn't mean she's insensitive; Dolly sincerely loves Fantomius, and gets worried when he elaborates particularly risky plans.\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Superheroes]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]"
