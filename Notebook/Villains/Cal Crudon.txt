The Ducks realize that those are fake alligators, except for one whose name is [[Antoinette]], and Cal tells them the story about the disappearance of the [[Colonel (Quack Pack)|Colonel]] (his former Chief Alligator Wrangler) and the alligators. So [[Daisy Duck|Daisy]] decides to solve the mystery about the disappearance of the gators.\n\nBut because Cal needs the publicity and since there aren't any gators, he tries to interest Daisy with several types of ranches from swamp rats to catfish ranches but to no avail. After the Ducks leave to find the missing gators, Cal isn't seen throughout the rest of the episode after this.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nCal Crudon1.jpg|Cal welcoming the Ducks to his ranch\nCal Crudon2.jpg|Cal offering Ol' Cajun Hot Sauce to the Ducks\nCal Crudon3.jpg|Cal depressed and ashamed after the jig is up\nCal Crudon4.jpg|Cal telling the Ducks the story of the disappearance of the [[Colonel (Quack Pack)|Colonel]] and his gators\nCal Crudon5.jpg|Cal mentioning [[Antoinette]]\nCal Crudon6.jpg|\"Cal Crudon's Swamp Rat Ranch\"\nCal Crudon7.jpg|\"Cal Crudon's Catfish Ranch\"\n</gallery>\n\n{{Quack Pack}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Crudon, Cal}}\n[[Category:Quack Pack characters]]\n[[Category:Farmers]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
