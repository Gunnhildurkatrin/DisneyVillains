The character was originally created in [[Pre-1922#1919|1919]] by [[New York]]-based pulp writer Johnston McCulley, and has been featured in numerous books, films and television series.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Zorro]]''===\nZorro is actually the secret identity of Don Diego de la Vega. After being asked to return home from [[Spain]] by his father, Diego soon learns that his beloved [[Los Angeles]] is under the control of a dictator Captain Enrique Monastario. However, as to not arouse any suspicion, Diego takes on the persona of a fop: An arrogant scholar who could seen mainly as a useless and lazy clown. However, by night, Diego dons his mask, cape and sword to ride as Zorro. He is always hunted by the inept soldier, but they can never capture him. He is loved by the people, who see the outlaw as a hero, for Zorro fights corruption and tyranny, and it was thanks to him. Monastario is then arrested and removed from power.\n\nHowever, many others would follow Monastario's views, or Zorro would fight banditos and other villains who dare to cross him. By riding atop his mount Tornado, his very fast and very intelligent horse, no one can catch Zorro, and no one will.\n\n===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===\nZorro never appeared on the show. He is first referenced in \"[[Operation Mongoose|Operation Mongoose Part 2]]\", and mentioned in the episode \"[[Leaving Storybrooke]]\", where he is revealed to be the father of [[Lily Page]] (the daughter of [[Maleficent]]) and is said to be able to turn himself into a dragon.\n\n==Trivia==\n*\"Zorro\" is the Spanish word for \"fox\".\n*There is a domino mask found in [[Pecos Bill Tall Tale Inn & Cafe|Pecos Bill's Tall Tale Inn and Cafe]] in [[Walt Disney World]]'s [[Frontierland (Magic Kingdom)|Frontierland]] which is frequently misidentified as belonging to Zorro.  The mask is intended to represent the similar pulp western character of the [[John Reid|Lone Ranger]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nZorro Guy Williams and Walt Disney.jpg|Guy Williams as Zorro with [[Walt Disney]].\nZorroandbernardo.jpg|Guy Williams as Zorro and Gene Sheldon as Bernardo in the 1950s ''Zorro'' television series.\nFullscreen capture 1102013 71302 PM.bmp.jpg|Don Diego.\nFullscreen capture 1102013 95008 AM.bmp.jpg\nFullscreen capture 1102013 71936 PM.bmp.jpg\nFullscreen capture 1102013 71914 PM.bmp.jpg|Don Diego looking at [[Anna Maria]].\nTimonzorro.jpg|[[Timon]] with the Z that stands for Zorro on his chest.\n</gallery>\n\n{{Zorro}}\n{{Once Upon a Time}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Zorro}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Zorro characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]\n[[Category:Superheroes]]\n[[Category:Horsemen]]\n[[Category:Once Upon a Time characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]"
