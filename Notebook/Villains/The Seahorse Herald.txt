Later, he is seen telling Sebastian that [[King Triton]] wants to speak to him about [[Ariel]]'s lovestruck behavior, causing Sebastian to mistakenly think that he knows that Ariel is in love with a human, which in turn causes him to accidentally blurt out the secret and anger Triton enough that he destroys Ariel's secret grotto. He is last seen when Triton (having regretted at what he has done) has ordered a search for his daughter to apologize at what he had done and Sebastian and asks him if any traces of them have been found.
