"[[File:The_Resistance_logo.jpg|thumb|250px|The logo for The Resistance.]]\n'''The Resistance''' is a small band of citizens of [[Danville]] who oppose the dictatorship of [[Heinz Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension)|Heinz Doofenshmirtz]]\u00a0and his family of the 2nd Dimension of the ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'' universe.\n\n==Background==\nThe Resistance was founded by [[Candace Flynn (2nd Dimension)|Candace]] sometime after the Doofenshmirtz family conquered The Tri-State Area with their armies of Norm Bots and Animal Borgs, without the knowledge of her parents. Several 2nd Dimension counterparts of 1st Dimension characters have almost immediately joined, either serving in roles that oversee Doofenshmirtz family being foiled in some way, such as [[Isabella Garcia-Shapiro (2nd Dimension)|Isabella]], or roles that involve providing help to members on the outside, such as [[Baljeet Tjinder (2nd Dimension)|Baljeet]]. Their activities against the Doofenshmirtz family are unknown, although the organization and Doofenshmirtz family seemed to have established a feud similar to that of the 1st Dimension [[Perry the Platypus|Perry]] and [[Heinz Doofenshmirtz|Heinz]]. At some point, one member, [[Buford Van Stomm (2nd Dimension)|Buford]], became heavily focused on rebelling against the Doofenshmirtz family that he abandoned his colleagues and became an independent rebel.\n\nPrior to the arrival of a group of 1st Dimension citizens, there were ten known Resistance members, with the possibility of more members in Danville open.\n==Members==\n[[File:Regulars_and_alternatives.jpg|thumb|Some of the members of \"The Resistance\"]]\n*[[Ferb Fletcher (2nd Dimension)]]\n*[[Candace Flynn (2nd Dimension)]]\u00a0(leader)\n*[[Isabella Garcia-Shapiro (2nd Dimension)]]\n*[[Baljeet Tjinder (2nd Dimension)]]\n*[[Jeremy Johnson (2nd Dimension)]]\n*[[Firestorm Girls]]\n*Possibly more unseen members\n===Former Members===\n*[[Buford Van Stomm (2nd Dimension)]]\n===1st Dimension Members===\n*[[Phineas Flynn]]\n*[[Ferb Fletcher]]\n*[[Candace Flynn]]\n*[[Perry the Platypus]]\n*[[Heinz Doofenshmirtz]]\n*[[Isabella Garcia-Shapiro]]\n*[[Buford Van Stomm]]\n*[[Baljeet Tjinder]]\n*[[Stacy Hirano]]\n*[[Jeremy Johnson]]\n*[[Jenny Brown|Jenny]]\n*[[Adyson Sweetwater|F]][[Ginger Hirano|i]][[Milly|r]][[Gretchen|e]][[Katie|s]][[Holly|i]][[Fireside Girls|de Girls]]\n*[[Django Brown]]\n*[[Irving Du Bois|Irving]]\n*[[Albert Du Bois|Albert]]\n*[[Organization Without a Cool Acronym|O.W.C.A. agents]]\n*Sally\n*Cindy\n*[[Love Handel]]\n*A group of 1st Dimension children\n\n{{PF-Wiki}}\n{{Phineas and Ferb}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Resistance, The}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Phineas and Ferb characters]]"
