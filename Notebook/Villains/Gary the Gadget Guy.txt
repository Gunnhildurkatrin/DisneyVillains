He likes wearing a white lab coat and his special curved spectacles, and enjoys eating Fish Dish [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Pizza Pizza], and is often seen drinking coffee. Unlike other penguins, his eyes are merely two black dots obscured by his glasses. He is also a member of the [[Elite Penguin Force]].\n==Inventions==\nGary has been making inventions since the first day of [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Club_Penguin Club Penguin]. Some of his inventions are around the [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Island island] for use by normal [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Penguin penguins], but most were put in the [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Gadget_Room Gadget Room], like the [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Test_Chamber Test Chamber] and the [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Crab_Translator_3000 Crab Translator 3000]. Gary ends most of his inventions with a number like 1000, 2000 or 3000 (Mainly 3000). 1000 is the prototype and 3000 is the complete version. It is probable that his projects receive copious funding from the [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/PSA PSA], since Gary would be unable to afford all required components without some source of financial support. Many of Gary's inventions have been proven as failures, such as the [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Ski_Lift_1000 Ski Lift 1000], therefore suggesting that his inventing skill is not as good as he lets on.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Gary has at least six lab coats: one that he wears, another in the [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Gadget_Room Gadget Room], three on a coat hanger in his [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Gary%27s_Room room] and one on the ground next to the coat hanger.\n*Gary has at least the first 32 pins in his collection.\n*Although Gary wears [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Old_Blue Old Blue] in the missions and on his player card, his in-game avatar is [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Blue Blue].\n*He likes extra cheese and anchovies on his pizza.\n*When people make a big crowd around him, he'll get nervous and try to hide or leave.\n*Gary mentions that he likes coffee and mathematics.\n*Gary wears a seemingly indestructible lab coat.\n*Gary is left handed, according to the [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Background background].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"210\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nGary CP.png\nGary Transparency.png\n185px-Gary_pizza.png|Gary as a chef\n185px-Gary_coffee.png|Gary drinks coffee\nTHE_G_HAS_EYES.png|Gary and [[Aunt Arctic]] swap glasses\nGary_In-Game.png|Gary's in-game sprite\n185px-GaryCards.jpg\n170px-G11.png\n112px-Agent_G.png\n164px-Happy_Gary.png\n185px-Gary_stamp.png|Gary's Stamp\nGary_sig.png|Gary's Signature\nimagesCAM4HD6M.jpg|Gary's second giveaway background\nimagesCA8ILEGV.jpg|A postcard sent by Gary\nGary.jpg|Gary's original player card\nimagesCA3PRR1P.jpg\nimagesCAX2QBX9.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Club Penguin}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Penguins]]\n[[Category:Club Penguin characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
