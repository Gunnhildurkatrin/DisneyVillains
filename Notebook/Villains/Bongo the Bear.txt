He is a bear cub who escapes the unfair treatment he faces in the circus.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Fun and Fancy Free]]''===\nIn the titular short, Bongo was a circus star, loved by people who came from miles around to watch him perform, but the owners of the circus treated him rather shabbily. Then one day, he ran away from the circus into the wild, where he meets his love, [[Lulubelle]].\n\nEventually he meets her jealous fianc\u00e9, [[Lumpjaw]], the meanest, toughest bear in the whole forest. When he confronts Lumpjaw, he is chased all the way to the raging river, which gave way to a waterfall, from which he lost his unicycle and from which Lumpjaw falls, and Bongo is hailed as a hero by the other bears in the forest.\n\n===Comics===\nBongo had a short career in comics in the fifties, notably appearing in comic books ''Walt Disney's Comics and Stories'' and ''Walt Disney's Silly Symphonies''. Contrary to the original film, Bongo, Lumpjaw and Lulubelle often talked in those comics. Nowadays he has disappeared of both American and Italian comic productions but still appears in Dutch comics (much like other \"forgotten\" Disney comic characters such as [[Br'er Rabbit]]). He also makes a short cameo with [[Lumpjaw]] in the last panel of the story ''[[This is Your Life, Donald Duck (comic)|This is Your Life, Donald Duck]]'' (Inducks W OS 1109-02), like other Disney characters like [[Captain Hook]], [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck]], and [[Goliath II]].\n\n===Cameos===\nBongo made short cameos in ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'' as one of the guest at [[J. Thaddeus Toad|Fezziwig]]'s party and in ''[[The Return of Jafar]]'', in which the [[Genie]] transforms into him during the song \"[[Nothing in the World (Quite Like a Friend)]]\".\n\nBongo appeared in ''[[Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse|Snowed in at the House of Mouse]]'' in the series ''[[House of Mouse]]''.\n\n==Disney Parks==\nBongo and Lulubelle made semi-regular appearances at the Disney theme parks up until the 1990s. They notably make a cameo appearance with [[Br'er Bear]] and two of the Country Bears in ''[[The Muppets at Walt Disney World]]'', as an audience for [[Fozzie Bear]]'s stand-up comedy act.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Bongo was the last Disney character to be animated by [[Art Babbitt]] (known for animating [[Goofy]], [[The Evil Queen]], [[Geppetto]] and [[Mr. Stork]]), because after leaving the studio during the strike, [[Walt Disney]] refused to speak to him when he came back to work on ''[[Fun and Fancy Free]]'', which led to Babbitt leaving Disney permanently. \n*In ''[[Zootopia]]'', one of the images on the wall of [[Judy Hopps|Judy]]'s room is a bear that seems to be wearing a similar outfit to Bongo.\n*[[Koda]] from [[Brother Bear|''Brother Bear'']] bears a strong resemblance to Bongo. It is possible that Koda was drawn after Bongo.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://users.cwnet.com/xephyr/rich/dzone/hoozoo/bongo.html Disney's HooZoo - Bongo]\n\n{{Fun and Fancy Free}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Bears]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Circus performers]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Fun and Fancy Free characters]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:English characters]]\n[[Category:Orphans]]"
