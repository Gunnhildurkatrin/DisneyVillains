She sometimes wears glasses because of her bad eyesight - mostly to see things that are very close like books, signs, and to play checkers. She likes pretty things.\n\nLilli comes from a long line of tightrope walkers, and became the next to join Dumbo's Circus following Fair Dinkum, with her mom, Mrs. Lilli's, blessing.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nLilli the Cat.jpg\nLilli Poster.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Dumbo}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Dumbo's Circus characters]]\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Circus performers]]\n[[Category:Detectives]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]"
