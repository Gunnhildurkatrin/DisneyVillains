However, despite his reputation of being the nicest man in the kingdom, he dislikes the [[Rapunzel|Princess]] because she changed [[Corona]]'s traditions. He also comes from a long line of Gopher Grab champions, and everyone in his family has won the Kingdom's Good Will Gopher Grab. Up until his debut in \"[[Rapunzel's Enemy]]\", Monty was never able to win the tournament until Rapunzel, in disguise, helped him fulfill his dream. Despite Rapunzel helping him win the tournament and saving his life, Monty still chooses to remain enemies with her, inspiring Rapunzel to do the same. But still, he does seem to appreciate her helping him to finally fulfill his dream.\n\nIn \"[[One Angry Princess]]\", Monty still holds a mutual dislike for Rapunzel to a degree but is far less hostile than before. At one point, he genuinely commends Rapunzel's on her selflessness in helping prove [[Attila]]'s innocence after he was accused of vandalizing Monty's shop. When Rapunzel apologizes for the damage done to Monty's establishment, Monty says it's okay and explains that he was planning on redecorating the shoppe anyway, and implies that he had been inspired by Rapunzel to do so. By the end, Attila is proven innocent, and a merge is created between his bakery and Monty's shoppe, now known as \"Monty's Sweet Shoppe with Attila the Bun's Bakery\".\n\nDespite his negative feelings for Rapunzel, in \"[[Hiccup Fever]]\" he\u00a0willingly tries to help\u00a0the princess cure her hiccups along with the rest of Corona.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn the season 3 premiere, Monty isn't too happy to see that Rapunzel has returned to Corona but smiles when Rapunzel is happy to see him. Monty appears throughout the season and although his fear is not revealed in \"[[Be Very Afraid]]\", Monty is among those who watch Lance's performance to help them get over their fears.\n\nMonty later plays a big part in trying to defeat [[Zhan Tiri]] in \"[[Plus Est En Vous]]\", along with other citizens of Corona, and goes to help Rapunzel along with everyone. Monty is later seen celebrating happily ever after with the rest of the kingdom following Zhan Tiri's demise and witnesses Rapunzel becoming queen of [[Corona]].\n\n\n==Trivia==\n*Monty's design was inspired by a mix of Captain Kangaroo and [[Eric Goldberg]].\n*Although Monty does not appear in season 2, he is mentioned by Eugene's clone in \"[[Mirror, Mirror (Tangled)|Mirror, Mirror]]\".\n*He dislikes Rapunzel.\n*Despite not getting along with each other for a while, it appears in season 3 that Rapunzel and Monty have gotten over their dislike for each other.\n*He introduced [[Pete and Stan|Stan]] to his wife.\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\">\nRapunzel's Enemy - Monty 04.jpg|Monty boos Rapunzel\nRapunzel's Enemy - Rapunzel and Monty 02.jpg\nRapunzel's Enemy - Monty 02.jpg\nRapunzel's Enemy 16.jpg|Monty befriends a disguised Rapunzel\nRapunzel's Enemy - Monty and King Frederic.jpg\nRapunzel's Enemy - Monty.jpg\nOne Angry Princess 10.png\nOne Angry Princess 12.png\nMonty Wearing His Glasses.png|Monty with his glasses\nBig-Brothers-of-Corona-2.png\nRapunzel greets Monty.png|Monty seems angry at Rapunzel's return...\nEven monty is happy to see rapunzel.png|...but is eventually happy to know she missed him\nThe Lost Treasure of Herz Der Sonne - Everybody 07.jpg\nTreasure hunters line up.png\nThe Lost Treasure of Herz Der Sonne (12).jpg\nVladimir and Monty take the lead.png\nVarian155.png\nThe Lost Treasure of Herz Der Sonne (13).jpg\nThe Lost Treasure of Herz Der Sonne (17).jpg\nOnce a Handmaiden...
