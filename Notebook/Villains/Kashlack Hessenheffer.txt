He appeared in \"Vatalihootsit It Up\" and was mentioned in \"Hook It Up\" and \"Give It Up\".\nKashlack is portrayed by [[Bronson Pinchot]].\n\n==Background==\nKashlack is a curly-haired, blonde-haired butcher and along with his wife, seems to be as strange (or even stranger) than his children. He owns a butcher shop. In his youth, Kashlack married a princess (Squitza) and had two kids (Gunther and Tinka), which caused Squitza to be dethroned as the princess of their country because of his status as a commoner. According to Gunther and Tinka, he's a huge \"butt-kisser\". Along with his wife and children, he dresses in odd, bright, and sparkly clothing.\n==Quotes==\n*\"Welcome, welcome. Who has 12 toes and loves to party? Me! I am Kashlack!\"\n*\"Someone wants a photograph with the K-man.\"\n*\"Tinkabell, there are six eyeballs to go around. Everybody gets an eyeball.\"\n*\"Not gelato. Goolasto. It's goose, stuffed inside a llama, stuffed inside an ostrich.\"\n*Kashlack: \"Back when Squitza was a princess, she walked into my butcher shop one day to get some strawberry and trout sausage and a little elk pudding.\n*Squitza: \"You know, comfort food.\"\n*Kashlack: \"The minute I saw her, I could not take my eyes off of her. Which was a pity, because my assistant lost a toe that day.\"\n*\"This may not be a palace, but it is our castle and she will always be my queen.\"\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kashlack Hessenheffer}}\n[[Category:Shake It Up characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:European characters]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
