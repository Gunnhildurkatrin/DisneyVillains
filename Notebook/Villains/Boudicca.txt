She is a female [[Gargoyle (creature)|gargoyle]] beast with the clan on [[Avalon]].\n\n==Role in the series==\nLike the rest of the [[Avalon Clan]], she led a happy life on Avalon until the attack of the [[Archmage]]'s forces. During that conflict, she met with [[Bronx]] for the first time, and the two got along rather well, and she helped during the battle to defeat [[Demona]] and [[Macbeth]] when they attacked [[Oberon]]'s palace.\n\nLater, she attempted to attack Oberon when he threatened the Avalon Clan, but she was chained to the ground and then nearly absorbed into Avalon by the powerful fay's sorcery. She was more tolerant of Oberon later, when he took her to [[Manhattan]] to track down [[Puck]]. She defended Oberon when he confronted the Xanatos family to take away their newborn son, [[Alexander Fox Xanatos|Alexander]], but was defeated by a blow from [[David Xanatos|Xanatos]]. Presumably, after the rest of this incident, Oberon returned her to Avalon where she resides to this day.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"200\" captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\">\nGhjk.jpg|Young Boudicca\nOberon mirror 001.jpg\nOberon mirror 002.jpg\nboudicca mirror travel.jpg|Boudicca steps out from [[Oberon's Mirror]]\nBoudicca.jpg|Boudicca with Oberon\nBoudicca3.jpg|Boudicca attacking Xanatos\nboudicca.gif\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.gargwiki.net/Boudicca Boudicca] at GargWiki\n\n{{Gargoyles}}\n[[Category:Gargoyles characters]]\n[[Category:Gargoyles]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]"
