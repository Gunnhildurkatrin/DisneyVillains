Derrick felt proud of himself after being recruited by Captain Jack to join him on his quest.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides]]''===\nAfter a fugitive [[Jack Sparrow]] finds himself in the Captain's Daughter pub and escapes from a group of [[Redcoats]] pursuing the captain, Derrick and a number of sailors signed to sail with Jack. Having been recruited by Jack, Derrick felt proud of Jack and asked who would buy a drink for him.\n\nOnboard the ''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]'', Derrick served as the ship's deckhands where he would work with a shanghaied Jack Sparrow. Derrick felt dissatisfied when sailing with [[Angelica]] and her [[Blackbeard's Zombie Officers|undead crewmen]] and participated during mutiny at the ''Revenge''. Jack's crew survived the mutiny until [[Blackbeard]] arrives and after explaining that he noticed a mutiny aboard the ship, Derrick and the rest of the human crew were hung; however, Derrick and the rest of the crewmen were let down, noticing the Cook being punished by Blackbeard to which the punished crewman suddenly becomes a zombie.\n\nArriving at [[Whitecap Bay]], Derrick and some of the crewmen of the ''Revenge'' were sent out to find a mermaid for Blackbeard to bring for the ritual and having attracted a mermaid, it is found out that this plan was a trap.
