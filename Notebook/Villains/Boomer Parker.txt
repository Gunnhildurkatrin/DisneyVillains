He always hits on girls, but strangely doesn't really seem to have crush on Mikayla, possibly due to knowing that Brady harbors feelings towards her. He considers himself to be very good-looking and may not be very smart. He believed himself to be a good singer in the episode \"Tone Deaf Jam\" thinking he had \"The Chimes\", later it turning out that Brady had \"The Chimes\". Boomer is he most historical of the twins, in boooooo-mer episode he repeatedly makes fun of Brady and repeats \"Ghost party\".\n\nBoomer is the most confident, he is always hitting on the girls and doesn't care what he looks like in the process.\n==Quotes==\n*\"You know, airborne breakfast is a delight.\"\n*[Right before Meerkat parachute time] \"Hang on brother Chauncey. I'm going under. Wheeeeee.\"\n*\"Scree scree scree meerkat.\ufeff\"\n*\"What?? Are you bananas?!\"\n*- Big Kings On Campus\n\n== Referances ==\n*[http://pairofkingspedia.wikia.com/wiki/Boomer Boomer on the Pair of Kings Wiki]\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parker, Boomer}}\n[[Category:Pair of Kings characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Kings]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Twins and Triplets]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
