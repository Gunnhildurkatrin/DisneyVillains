It is then mentioned that he called upon his guests to tell him ghost stories. Afterwards he isn't seen again, including at his daughter's wedding to [[Brom Bones]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nichabod-mr-toad-disneyscreencaps_com-4852.jpg\nichabod-mr-toad-disneyscreencaps_com-4862.jpg\nichabod-mr-toad-disneyscreencaps_com-4868.jpg\nichabod-mr-toad-disneyscreencaps_com-4869.jpg\nichabod-mr-toad-disneyscreencaps_com-4870.jpg\nichabod-mr-toad-disneyscreencaps_com-5202.jpg\nichabod-mr-toad-disneyscreencaps_com-5206.jpg\nichabod-mr-toad-disneyscreencaps_com-5208.jpg\nichabod-mr-toad-disneyscreencaps_com-6108.jpg\nichabod-mr-toad-disneyscreencaps_com-6110.jpg\nichabod-mr-toad-disneyscreencaps_com-6112.jpg\nichabod-mr-toad-disneyscreencaps_com-6114.jpg\nichabod-mr-toad-disneyscreencaps_com-6120.jpg\nichabod-mr-toad-disneyscreencaps_com-6121.jpg\nichabod-mr-toad-disneyscreencaps_com-6123.jpg\nichabod-mr-toad-disneyscreencaps_com-6125.jpg\nichabod-mr-toad-disneyscreencaps_com-6126.jpg\nichabod-mr-toad-disneyscreencaps_com-6128.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad}}\n[[fr:Baltus Van Tassel]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Widows/Widowers]]\n[[Category:The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad characters]]\n[[Category:Character stubs]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Farmers]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
