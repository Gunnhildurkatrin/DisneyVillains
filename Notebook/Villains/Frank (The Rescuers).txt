He is a green frill-necked lizard who was captured by [[Percival McLeach|Percival C. McLeach]].\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nFrank is terrified of being killed and turned into a purse. He is also extremely cowardly and hyperactive.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nHe is a small green frilled lizard, who frequently gets his frill stuck in things. He is very fast, hyperactive, a bit of a motor-mouth, and a coward, though he does try to help and shows some guts when he ends up on Joanna's back and pulls a cowboy act with her.\n\n==Role in the [[The Rescuers Down Under|film]]==\nFrank is first seen in the middle of the film after [[Cody (The Rescuers)|Cody]] is thrown into a cage with him by [[Percival McLeach|McLeach]]. Frank is one of the many animals that McLeach has poached for various ways of making money. He quickly joins in Cody's yelled defiances of McLeach, though he becomes frightened at first when approached by the boy. After Cody tells McLeach he'll never tell him where [[Marahute]] is, Frank pops out of the hay and joins in. Cody then asks Frank where he came from, and he says he was from the desert. Frank covers his ears when he hears [[Krebbs]] tell him he is going to be made into a purse. Cody then tells Frank they're going to get\u00a0out of here. Frank uses his tail to pick the lock on the cage and frees himself. He then hatches\u00a0a plan to get the key. After successfully retrieving the key, while making a boisterous racket, he gets\u00a0caught by McLeach and shuts himself back in the cage out of fear. He isn't seen again for the rest of the film. Since he managed to use his tail to pick the lock, it\u2019s possible that he freed himself again after McLeach left and eventually freed the rest of the animals.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the [[Aladdin (TV series)|''Aladdin'' TV series]] episode \"[[Do the Rat Thing]]\", [[Iago]] was turned into a frill-necked lizard and bore a similar resemblance to Frank.\n*During the \"[[Pomp and Circumstance]]\" suite of ''[[Fantasia 2000]]'', not only does Frank make a cameo, but he appears to have a wife as well.\n*Before Frank panics of becoming a purse, he hums the Australian song \"{{WikipediaLink|Waltzing Matilda}}\".\n\n{{The Rescuers}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Australian characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Lizards]]\n[[Category:The Rescuers characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
