Audubon Woodlore]].\n\n==Background==\nAs supporting and background characters, the personalities of the Bears are not developed in detail. They do appear to be fairly easy going, but do not like being tricked. In most shorts, they are presented as being more competent in typical bear activities than Humphrey.\n\n==Disney shorts==\nThe Bears typically appear as a group in various shorts, but generally do not have a major effect on the plot.\n\nIn ''[[Grin and Bear It]]'', the bears are ordered to pair off with different tourists picnicking in the park, but are reminded to refrain from stealing food. In ''[[Bearly Asleep]]'', the bears prepare for winter hibernation, but kick Humphrey out for being disruptive. The bears are forced to hide in their cave during hunting season in ''[[Rugged Bear]]''. In ''[[Beezy Bear]]'', the Bears are lectured by the Ranger to keep of [[Donald Duck]]'s property, where he has a honey farm. When Donald's honey is stolen, several of the bears are placed in a police-style lineup to help determine the thief.\n\nThe bears' largest role came in the short ''[[In the Bag]]''. After tourists leave the park in a mess, the Ranger tricks the bears into cleaning it. The bears figure out the trick and quit. However, when the Ranger bribes them with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cacciatore Chicken Cacciatore], the bears simply push their trash into Humphrey's area, leaving him to clean the entire mess while the other bears enjoy themselves.\n\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nInthebag4thumb.jpg\n349349999.jpg\nTumblr m22ivcX3wt1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\nTumblr m0bn2oiGsy1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\nRangerOfBrownstone.jpg\n1959-duck-flies-coop-06.jpg\nThis is Your Life, Donald Duck - Gathering.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Mickey Mouse & Friends}}\n{{House of Mouse}}\n{{Mickey Mouse Works}}\n[[Category:Bears]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Custodians]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse Works characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]"
