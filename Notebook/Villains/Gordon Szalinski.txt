He generally is good-natured, but occasionally loses his cool and his temper when he gets mad, as demonstrated when he put Wayne in a headlock and threatened to kill him upon finding out they had been shrunk.\n\nGordon enjoys having fun with the kids (he gave his nephew, [[Adam Szalinski|Adam]], a Shark Cruiser Hot Wheels car for Christmas) but at the same time is a firm disciplinarian who has a zero-tolerance policy for bad behavior. He did not like seeing Mitch being bullied by [[Ricky King]], and was all too eager to put Ricky in his place.\n\nAccording to Wayne, Gordon is also well-organized, good at dealing with people, and \"never forgets what day of the week it is.\" Wayne offers him the job as President of Szalinski Labs, which he gratefully accepts, and says, \"You bet. This is great! I'm gonna have so much fun.\"\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Honey, I Shrunk the Kids}}\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Uncles]]\n[[Category:Honey, I Shrunk the Kids characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]"
