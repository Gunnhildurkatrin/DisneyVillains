Finally, she comes to a fence by [[Big Mama]]'s tree, where Big Mama watches as the mother fox leaves her pup in some large grass underneath the fence post to hide and protect him and then runs off into the distance, hearing the dog\u00a0and the hunter\u00a0coming near. Suddenly, gunshots ring as she is shot to death (off-screen), much to Big Mama's shock and the pup's dismay. She had sacrificed herself to save her offspring, which makes the pup now an orphan until being found and adopted by [[Widow Tweed]].\n\n==Trivia==\n*Tod's Mother's death resembles that of [[Bambi's mother|Bambi]]'s mother's death, as they both were shot by hunters off-screen.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nfox-and-the-hound-disneyscreencaps.com-94.jpg|Tod's mother being chased\nfox-and-the-hound-disneyscreencaps.com-198.jpg|Tod's mother's death\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Fox and the Hound}}\n[[nl:Frey's moeder]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Foxes]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:The Fox and the Hound characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]"
