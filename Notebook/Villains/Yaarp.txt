'''Experiment 613''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]]. He is designed to create devastating sonic blasts that can shatter windows, flatten buildings, and cause acute loss of hearing. Luckily, he can also reduce these noises to soft, gentle honks. His one true place is at [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]]'s [[Kai\u0101ulu Hale|hula school]] as an alien invasion alarm and buzzer.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nYaarp, despite his destructive nature, is quite friendly, but he responds quickly and dramatically to the way others treat him. For example, if he feels intimidated or provoked, he will emit loud sonic blasts. If he feels safe or unthreatened, he will emit small, gentle honks as a sign of affection and friendship.\n\nYaarp, for the most part, is pretty easygoing and laid-back. However, he is very ready-minded and cautious, but is loyal to those who win his trust. He is also a bit jumpy and nervous, often sounding his horn at improper times because something trivial had startled him.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nYaarp is a small, turquoise/blue lemur-like experiment with four arms, small floppy [[Drowsy]]-like ears, and a foghorn-like antenna on his head. The antenna, the tips of his ears, and the single ring on his tail, as well as the tail's tip, are all blue. The area around his eyes, his muzzle and chest/belly, and his paw pads are all a lighter variant of his body color.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nYaarp can produce devastating sonic blasts through his megaphone-like antenna. These noises can range from small, gentle honks to massive shock waves that can shatter buildings and cause acute loss of hearing. His tail can act like a spring, as he often bounces on it instead of using his limbs.\n\nYaarp has shown to be skilled in playing the foghorn-like device on his head like a trumpet.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment 613 was the 613th experiment to be created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to use his sonic-blasting ability to cause massive damage and deafen nearby victims. 613 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai, with 613's pod landing in [[Mrs. Hasagawa]]'s [[Hasagawa Fruits|fruit stand]].\n\nWhen Mrs. Hasagawa watered her fruit, 613's pod got wet, activating the experiment. After being admired by [[Charles and Mary|a couple]] on their honeymoon, 613 then proceeded to cause massive chaos using his destructive shock waves.\n\nWhen [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]], wearing special earmuffs, later chased 613 into an electronics store, the latter was captured in a container, but rescued and freed by [[Stitch]]. Instead of showing gratitude, 613 emitted a sonic blast that made Stitch go temporarily deaf, then fled the store with Gantu in hot pursuit.\n\nSince Stitch was highly sensitive to 613's shock waves, [[Pleakley]] was chosen for the task. After [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], Stitch, and [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] attempted to train and condition Pleakley, he was equipped with experiment catching gear. They tracked 613 down to a cave, where Stitch, using a conch, posed as the experiment and acted like a decoy. He then imitated 613's sonic blast to alert Gantu, who donned his earmuffs and pursued Stitch.\n\nMeanwhile, a reluctant Pleakley entered the cave and discovered 613. When Pleakley unintentionally blasted 613 with a vacuum, the latter retaliated using a massive shock wave. However, when a sudden cave-in endangered 613's life, he was then saved by Pleakley. 613 was grateful and kissed Pleakley 3 times, who christened him Yaarp.\n\nPleakley and Yaarp soon fled the crumbling cave and made it out safely. When Yaarp first noticed Lilo, he growled until Pleakley assured him that she was a friend, causing Yaarp to emit a gentle honk. Unfortunately, Stitch got captured by Gantu (who thought Stitch was actually Yaarp) during the process, and the latter demanded a ransom.\n\nAs part of a setup, Yaarp was taken to the local museum for a ransom exchange. When Lilo arrived with Yaarp in a pet carrier, the former made Gantu believe that Yaarp was rehabilitated. However, (as planned) when Gantu removed his earmuffs and bartered Stitch for Yaarp, the latter unleashed a sonic blast upon Lilo's signal, alerting the authorities and forcing Gantu to flee.\n\nYaarp was shortly after revealed to the [[Mayor Anolo|mayor]] and [[Nicol\u00e9|chairwoman]], and then given a one true place as an alien invasion alarm at Lilo's [[Kai\u0101ulu Hale|hula school]].\n\nYaarp reappeared in \"[[Elastico (episode)|Elastico]]\" as one of the audience members for Lilo's hula dance.\n\nIn \"[[Spike (episode)|Spike]]\", Yaarp served as the scorekeeper for the Ohana-Rama, and was also briefly seen hiding under the couch during Pleakley's E.A.R.W.A.X. session.\n\nIn \"[[Remmy (episode)|Remmy]]\", Yaarp was one of the experiments in Lilo's dream.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nIn the film's opening Yaarp can be seen greeting [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] with sonic blasts from his megaphone-like antenna.\n\nLater, the first 624 experiments, including Yaarp, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, Lilo, [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]], and [[Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nYaarp participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]], but it is unknown what he did.\n\nThe Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe. Yaarp joins them for the song by playing the built-in foghorn-like device on his head.\n\n===''[[Stitch!]]''===\nYaarp made an appearance in the ''Stitch!'' anime special ''Stitch and the Planet of Sand''.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink|Yaarp}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Yaarp was first revealed in a DVD bonus feature of ''[[Stitch! The Movie]]'' in the experiment gallery.\n*Yaarp is one of the ten known experiments named by someone other than Lilo, the other nine being [[Gigi]], [[Elastico]], [[Hammerface]], [[Heat]], [[Thresher]], [[Plasmoid]], [[Morpholomew]], [[Shrink]], and [[Leroy]].\n**He is also one of the six known experiments to be rehabilitated by someone other than Lilo and Stitch, the other five being Gigi, Elastico, [[Spike (Lilo & Stitch)|Spike]], [[Frenchfry]], and [[Snooty]].\n*Yaarp was named after a word from Pleakley's [[Plorgonar|home planet]].\n*According to Jumba, Yaarp \"was [his] first attempt to wreak havoc with high-decibel sonic disturbance, resonant compression, and oscillating vibrational distortion.\" Simply put, Yaarp \"makes loud noises\", while his \"sonic blasts can shatter windows, flatten buildings, and cause acute loss of hearing.\"\n*Yaarp's [[Experiment Pods|pod]] color is yellow.\n*In \"[[Spike (episode)|Spike]]\", only Spike, [[Fibber]], [[Nosy]], [[Bonnie (Lilo & Stitch)|Bonnie]], [[Clyde (Lilo & Stitch)|Clyde]], [[Slushy]], and [[Splodyhead]] were part of Pleakley's E.A.R.W.A.X. group, but in one scene, Yaarp can clearly be seen hiding under the couch.\n*Yaarp's torso and tail appear in the online game ''[[Jumba's Lab (Game)|Jumba's Lab]]''.\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]"
