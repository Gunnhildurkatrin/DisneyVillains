A heavyset middle-aged bachelor with an effeminate personality. He's one of the few adults that isn't ruffled by Kick's behavior (except in \"Nerves of Steal\" where he's really sure that Kick's the person who has been stealing personal items from him and his neighbors). He is afraid of Mrs. Chicarelli, who seems to dislike him due to him having no problems with Kick.\n\n==Background==\nMr. Vickle has stated that he was in the Navy and people should know not to mess with him. He also had a goldfish he loved more than anything when he was somewhat younger, though the age he was is hard to guess since he still had a mustache and was bald.\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"200\" spacing=\"small\">\nDwte_mr.vickle.jpg\nFar_pescadoeldiablo&mrvickle.png\nmr.vickle'sintroduction.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Kick Buttowski: Suburban Daredevil}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vickle, Mr.}}\n[[Category:Kick Buttowski characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
