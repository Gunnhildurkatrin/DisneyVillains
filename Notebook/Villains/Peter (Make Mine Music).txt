When he is stopped, scolded, and spanked by his grandfather, who forbids him to go wolf hunting, his cap and popgun are taken from him. However, as soon as his grandfather falls asleep in his chair by the fireplace,\u00a0he manages to get his things back and sneak outside. He later befriends Sasha, Sonia, and Ivan, who accompany him on his wolf hunt. He panics when he first encounters the wolf, and inadvertently shoots its nose with his popgun before fleeing from it. He mourns with the rest of the gang when the wolf supposedly eats Sonia, and later shows bravery when he lowers down Ivan\u00a0with a rope, which he ties to the wolf's tail to save Sasha from getting eaten. When Sasha later brings back some [[Misha, Yasha, and Vladimir|hunters]], they notice that Peter and Ivan have already captured the wolf. Peter can be seen leading the victory parade at the end of the segment.\n\n===''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''===\nPeter made a cameo appearance during the final scenes with the\u00a0[[toon]]s.\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\nPeter makes cameo appearances as a guest in several episodes of this series, including \"[[Ask Von Drake]]\" and \"[[House of Turkey]]\".\n\n===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===\nPeter appears in ''Once Upon a Time'', played by Jesse Hutch.
