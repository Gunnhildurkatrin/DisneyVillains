She is very interested in finding the next Flawless Girl and despairs that she might not do so. Her strict requirements are that candidates must be at least 5 foot 10 inches. She appears only to choose the new Flawless Girl by height, because it sets a standard for beauty unobtainable by the average woman (\"[[Attack of the 50 Foot Sister]]\").\n==Trivia==\n*Her strongest personality traits are that she only cares about fame, glory, and of course, money.\n*She dated [[Francis \"Major\" Monogram|Major Monogram]] once when he was an exchange student in [[France]] (\"[[Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension#Bonus Features|Phineas and Ferb The Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension (DVD)]]\").\n*She tried to make [[Candace Flynn|Candace]] the year's Flawless Girl, despite her being 50 feet tall.\n==Appearances==\n*\"[[Attack of the 50 Foot Sister]]\"\n*\"[[Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension#Bonus Features|Phineas and Ferb The Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension (DVD)]]\" (Mentioned only)\n*\"Mandace\" {{Cameo}}\n\n{{PF-Wiki}}\n{{Phineas and Ferb}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dishon, Blanca}}\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Phineas and Ferb characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
