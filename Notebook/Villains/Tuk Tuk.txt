Suddenly, a Druun appears and prepares to attack the two to which Raya eradicates the monster with a piece of the Dragon Gem.

After brainstorming ideas for what could serve such a purpose in a fantasy environment, the filmmakers created a hybrid animal with the ability to curl into a ball and ride. The visual development artists later expanded on this idea to create a full-fledged character in Tuk Tuk.<ref name=\"Sidekick\"/>\n*Tuk Tuk is [[Alan Tudyk]]\u2019s eighth consecutive role in the [[Disney Animated Canon]].\n**[[Heihei]], who coincidentally was also voiced by Alan Tudyk, made a cameo in ''Raya and the Last Dragon''.\n*Tuk Tuk is one of the few animal sidekicks in Disney to be both fictional and a hybrid of two different kinds of species.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Raya and the Last Dragon}}\n[[es:Tuk Tuk]]\n[[ja:\u30c8\u30a5\u30af\u30c8\u30a5\u30af]]\n[[pt-br:Tuk Tuk]]\n[[Category:Raya and the Last Dragon characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Asian characters]]\n[[Category:Armadillos]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Hybrids]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Disney Magic Kingdoms characters]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Disney Sorcerer's Arena Characters]]\n[[Category:Raya and the Last Dragon]]\n[[Category:Pill-bug creatures]]"
