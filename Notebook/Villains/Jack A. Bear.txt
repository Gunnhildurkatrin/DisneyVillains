Bear''' or simply '''Bear''' is the male protagonist of the [[2015]] Disney Junior animated series ''[[Goldie & Bear]]''. He is best friends with [[Goldie (Goldie & Bear)|Goldie]]; he ended up meeting her after she entered his home without permission and destroyed his favorite chair by accident. He lives at home with his mother and father bear. He and Goldie go on adventures around [[Fairy Tale Forest (Goldie & Bear)|Fairy Tale Forest]]. Bear is very neat and tidy. He also can be stubborn. Bear tends to use magical \"solutions\" when he could be better with non-magical ones, such as using the Fairy Godmother's wand to give himself wings, using magic shoes to help himself dance, and turning Frog into Prince Charming for Goldie's party.\n\nBear has light brown fur with pink ear canals and a pale brown muzzle, dark yellow eyes and a dark brown nose. He generally wears a light yellow long-sleeved shirt with green sleeves and a light yellow pocket. Like a lot of cartoon animal characters, he doesn't wear pants.\n\n\n==Gallery==\n===Animation===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nPrincess Goldie.jpg\nGoldie and Bear in Swimsuit.png\nBear and Sprites.png\n</gallery>\n\n===Merchandise and Miscellaneous===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nGoldie and Bear 8 Characters Toys.jpg\nGoldie and Bear 4 Characters Dolls.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Goldie & Bear}}\n[[Category:Bears]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Kings]]\n[[Category:Goldie & Bear characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Giants]]"
