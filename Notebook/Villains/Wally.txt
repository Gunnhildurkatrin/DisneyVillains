He makes his only appearance in the episode \"[[Fears of a Clown]]\" where he moves into the apartment building, and makes his presence known to Booker, Levi, Nia and Tess who all compete for his attention. He is portrayed by Tristan DeVan.\n\n==History==\nWally moves into the [[Apartment Building|apartment building]] with his parents from [[Colorado]]. Having just arrived, he finds a giant stuffed gorilla hand in the garbage, and climbs onto the roof deck with it but struggles. He calls for help, and [[Booker Baxter-Carter|Booker]] and [[Levi Grayson|Levi]] who are also on the deck, assist him, with the three becoming friends. Booker and Levi take a shine to him and help in participating him catapult a dummy from the roof, to which they bond over. While travelling through the hallways, Wally bumps into [[Nia Baxter-Carter|Nia]] and [[Tess]], who are smitten with him (tough he is oblivious to this). He introduces himself to them, and Nia and Tess quickly leave after embarrassing themselves. He heads to Levi and Booker's house, and the pair introduces him to [[Raven Baxter|Raven]] whom he sparks a reaction from, after mentioning his mother works as a clown. While helping Levi and Booker construct a fort, Wally is enticed by the smell of cookies, which Nia and Tess baked in order to lure him, though Booker warns the girls off. While loitering within the fort, Nia and Tess both come up with excuses to see Wally, and after he explains to them how he thinks of them as cool, the girls come to the realisation that Wally isn't, leaving the boys to play with each other. Diane later arrives to pick Wally up, though the two quickly leave after realising they are not welcome, due to Raven's phobia. Wally and his mother are later invited back to Raven's home where they watch her perform as a clown, as her form of apology to Diane. While the mothers are in the kitchen, Wally and Booker try sneaking in a stuffed monkey head but are caught by Raven, who commands them to get it out.\n\n==Trivia==\n*He's in 7th grade.\n*He's a Leo.\n\n{{That's So Raven}}\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Raven's Home characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
