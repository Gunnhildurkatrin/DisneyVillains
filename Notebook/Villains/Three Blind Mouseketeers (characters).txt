They are blind mice with a great love of cheese.\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n=== ''[[Three Blind Mouseketeers]]'' ===\nThey are the titular characters of the short. They are first seen chanting upon themselves with their catchphrase, \"all for one and one for all\"!, then subsequently going to get cheese.\n\nUnknown to them, but there enemy for many years, Captain Katt has set mouse traps within cheese he has left out. However, all three evade the traps that he set out, eating the cheese with a toast with wine, the corks hitting and waking Katt up.\n\nWith Katt chasing them upon him waking up, he flees upon seeing many mice together with one of them (in reality it is only the mouseketeer's reflection), causing Katt to run away, bringing celebration with themselves with wine.\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n=== Screenshots ===\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\">\n24605.jpg\nTumblr ll9hd7WXft1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\nThreeblindmousketeers.jpg\n24607.jpg\nTve27383-62-1007.jpg\n24608.jpg\n24610.jpg\n24611.jpg\n24612.jpg\n24613.jpg\n1936-trois-espiegles-petites-souris-03.jpg\n1936-trois-espiegles-petites-souris-06.jpg\n1936-trois-espiegles-petites-souris-09.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n=== Miscellaneous ===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nThree Blind Mouseketeers models.jpg\nThreeBlindMouseketeers.jpg\nMousekeeteers-Draw-Concept.jpg\nwalt-disney-studios-three-blind-mouseketeers-production-drawing-animation-art-(walt-disney,-1936).jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Silly Symphonies characters]]\n[[Category:Mice]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Character trios]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Characters with disabilities]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]"
