When Pluto jumps into a bucket of water to cool off, Mickey tells Pluto to make up after the kitten gives him a lick and he does the same by licking back.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The kitten appears to be an early version of the nameless kitten featured in the [[1942]] short, ''[[Lend a Paw]]''.\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]"
