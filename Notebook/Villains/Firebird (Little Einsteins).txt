For the villain, see: [[The Firebird|''The Firebird'']] from [[Fantasia 2000]].\n\n'''The Firebird''' is a magic bird that brings music to all of [[Russia]].\n\n\n\n==Rocket's Firebird Rescue==\n\nIn the story, Firebird was responsible for bringing all the music in Russia and always got away from Katschai. When Katschai finally captured her, he locked her up in a birdcage where she couldn't bring or make any music. Eventually, she was rescued by the Little Einsteins and went back to her duties.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Despite her color, she has nothing to do with fire.\n*When one of her feathers were taken off, you can use her power for music.\n*Her theme song is [[The Firebird Suite|the Firebird Suite]].\n*The Firebird is based on Slavic folklore creature [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firebird_(Slavic_folklore) Firebird]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery navigation=\"true\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nFirebird 2.png|The Firebird book\nFirebird 3.png|Firebird being locked up by Katschei\nF7E37C00-94E1-4ECA-A3EE-DB9147AE07F5.jpeg|Firebird released by Rocket|link=Firebird (Little Einsteins)\n</gallery>\n\n{{Little Einsteins}}\n[[Category:Birds]]\n[[Category:Little Einsteins characters]]\n[[Category:Mystical animals]]\n[[Category:Russian characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Slavic characters]]"
