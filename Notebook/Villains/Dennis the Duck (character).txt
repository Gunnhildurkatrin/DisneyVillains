Co-incidentally, Disney would successfully regain the rights to use Oswald from Universal for the first time since the 1920s in 2006.\n\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
