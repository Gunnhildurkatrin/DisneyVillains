Very unusual for the leading characters, they were intended to satirize the concept of a typical Disney romance.<ref>{{Cite web|publisher=WordPress|url=https://iftheglassslipperfitsblog.wordpress.com/2016/08/30/rapunzels-hairy-story-problems/|title=Rapunzel's Hairy Story Problems|format=Blog}}</ref>\n\n==Role in the film==\nClaire and Vince were two ordinary teenagers living in [[San Francisco]] who did not get along. While it was clear that Vince was a pizza delivery boy, concept art seemed to suggest that Claire was a beauty obsessed teen who wanted to look prettier. Through unexplained means, the two are transported into the fairy tale world by an evil witch who wanted to prove that true love does not conquer all. The short haired Claire found herself with incredibly long hair while the slobby and rude Vince found himself in nice clean clothes.\n\nMeanwhile, the real [[Rapunzel]] and [[Beau|Prince Beau]] (a character that would transition into [[Bastion]] and then [[Flynn Rider]]) would have been transformed by the evil witch into a squirrel and a basset hound, respectively. Ultimately, the quartet would have teamed up to save the day while also learning to fall in love.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The premise of ordinary people in a modern-day city interacting with fairy tale characters would later be recycled in the live-action/animated film ''[[Enchanted]]''.\n*The character's relationship was loosely inspired by {{WikipediaLink|Shrek (character)|Shrek}} and {{WikipediaLink|Princess Fiona|Fiona}} of the ''{{WikipediaLink|Shrek (franchise)|Shrek}}'' film series. Ironically, ''Shrek'' satirized Disney conventions of two perfect people falling in love by having two \"imperfect\" people doing so instead. Not catching on to what was actually meant to be something of an insult, then Disney CEO, [[Michael Eisner]], apparently was the one who pushed for the idea of the imperfect pairing after seeing the film.\n*They are named after [[Claire Keane]], daughter of [[Glen Keane]], and her husband Vincent Rogozyk.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://d-princesses.livejournal.com/1003796.html|title=Rapunzel Unbraided|website=D-Princesses|date=December 5, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nRapunzel Teens Before.jpg|Before\nRapunzel Teens After.jpg|After\nClaire Rapunzel Concept.jpg\nRapunzel and Claire.jpg\nVince Rapunzel Concept.jpg\nVince Rapunzel Study.jpg\nVince Rapunzel Study 2.jpg\nClaire and Vince Love.jpg\nClaire Rapunzel Render.jpg|Claire with a \"squirrel-ified\" Rapunzel\nRapunzel-Concept Art.jpg\nRapunzel Vince Render.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Tangled}}\n[[Category:Tangled characters]]\n[[Category:Deleted characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]"
