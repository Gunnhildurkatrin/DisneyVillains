"{{Infobox_character|image=Ken_Wu.jpg|films=[[D2: The Mighty Ducks]]\n[[D3: The Mighty Ducks]]|shows=[[The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers]]|status=Alive|actor=Justin Wong}}\n\nKen Wu is currently is a hockey player and plays at the Forward Position, and wears number 16. He is a former Olympic figure skater who dazzles opponents with his acrobatic, stylistic techniques and sets up scoring opportunities. \n\n<br />\n\n== Biography ==\nKen first appears in ''[[D2: The Mighty Ducks]]'' as part of the [[Team USA (Junior Goodwill Games)]] team. In the first match-up against [[Iceland]], he attempts to use one of his figure skating moves to get the puck into the goal but is brutally knocked down by the bigger players, thus making Coach Bombay irritated by the lack of effort Ken made. After taking what he has learned from [[Russ Tyler|Russ Tyler's]] LA Street Hockey Team and standing up against an Iceland team member twice his size, Ken became dubbed by [[Fulton Reed|Fulton]] and [[Dean Portman|Portman]] as \"Little Bash Brother\". He later attended [[Eden Hall Academy]], as seen in ''[[D3: The Mighty Ducks]]''. Ken was picked on by the varsity team, who stole his lunch every day and distributed the contents of it amongst themselves. Later in the film, he begs Russ to teach him the tricks of talking smack to other team members but fails miserably when he delivers ones that are too long. He is portrayed by Justin Wong.\n\n== Playing Style ==\nKen uses his small size and figure skating experience to his advantage when playing offense. His skills are used to maneuver around opposing defenses and trick goaltenders. However, because of his small size, he is more vulnerable to bigger defenders if caught.\n\n== Trivia ==\n\n* Ken Wu is known as the third \"little\" bash brother. According to [[Dean Portman]].\n* Ken will re-appear in [[The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers]].\n{{The Mighty Ducks}}\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:The Mighty Ducks characters]]\n[[Category:Chinese characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]"
