He is primarily colored cream, with a spot on his back and his nose being brown. He also has brown freckles on his snout.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Diogee resembles Paw Pooch from \"Krypto the Superdog\".\n*Diogee's name is pronounced the same as the letters \"D-O-G\", which spell \"dog\", the species Diogee belongs to.\n*Diogee is one quarter llama dog, which according to Milo means he can herd llamas like a sheepdog can herd sheep. (\"It just doesn't come up very often.\") Diogee can also understand Spanish, having attended at least one of Milo's Spanish classes in school.\n*His middle name is \"Ex Machina\", which most likely comes from the Latin phrase \"[[Wikipedia:Deus ex machina|deus ex machina]]\", which has come to mean a plot device that suddenly (even abruptly) solves a problem.\n**Coincidentally, the first three letters of his name \"Dio\" (as in \"'''''D-i-o'''-g-e-e''\") are forming an Italian word, which came from the Latin \"deus\".\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"180\">\nGoing the Extra Milo 3.jpg\nParty of Peril 14.png\nBackward to School Night 4.png\nMilo Mirphy's Law S2 Promo.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n== External Links ==\n* [https://milomurphyslaw.fandom.com/wiki/Diogee Diogee] on [https://milomurphyslaw.fandom.com/wiki/Milo_Murphy%27s_Law_Wiki Milo Murphy's Law Wiki]\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Milo Murphy's Law}}\n[[Category:Milo Murphy's Law characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Time travelers]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
