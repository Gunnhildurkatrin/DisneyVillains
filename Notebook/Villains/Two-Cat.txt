In spite of this, it shows footage of what is going on through its camera lens.\n\n==Role in the film==\nTwo-Cat first appears during the part where [[Milo (Mars Needs Moms)|Milo]] encounters a group of male Martians just as he deploys Milo at the area where [[Gribble]] is at. He later watches Gribble spying on Milo planning to find his mother. Furthermore, Milo encounters Two-Cat again playing an important role in helping Milo find Gribble just as Two-Cat shows footage of a dangerous area Gribble is at just as it and Milo plan to rescue him in the area where the Martians are planning to terminate him. Milo manages to rescue Gribble from the Martians.\n\nAt the translucent cavern, Two-Cat and [[Ki]] arrive to help Milo rescue his mother just as it and the rest of Milo's gang continue this plan working together. After surviving many traps that slow down Milo's friends, Two-Cat, Ki, and Gribble plan to take care of the spaceship and the SISS while Milo manages to find his mother and Gribble saves her life. With the [[Supervisor]] arrested, Two-Cat, Gribble, and Milo arrive back on Earth and rejoice with Milo and suddenly later leave for Mars after Milo reunites with her mother on earth once again. During the credits, Two-Cat uses a cable for a Mars rover and plugs in a cable to work in conjunction with Ki and Gribble working together to give signal to NASA.\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n== Trivia ==\n\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Mars Needs Moms characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]"
