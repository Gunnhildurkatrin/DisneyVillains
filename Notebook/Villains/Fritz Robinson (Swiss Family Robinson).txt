Fritz, his [[William Robinson|father]], and brothers try to call for help but no one seems to be on board to answer their call until their ship gets caught on the rocks.\n\nIn the morning, Fritz and his brother, Ernst, help Father break free from their room to allow their [[Elizabeth Robinson|mother]] and youngest brother, Francis, to get out as well. They find themselves shipwrecked next to a deserted [[New Switzerland|island]], the ship's [[Captain Wilhelm|captain]] and crew gone, and the farm animal livestock trapped inside along with Captain Wilhelm's dogs, [[Duke and Turk]].\n\nFritz and his family begin to build a [[Raft (Swiss Family Robinson)|raft]] out of the ship's wood and anything else they can find. Then they begin collecting all their belongings including guns and muskets from Captain Wilhelm's cabin and anything else they might need to survive. When Francis starts loading some of the animals from the ship including Duke and Turk, Father clearly explains that they won't sail to shore with the animals until everyone is safe, so, he begins to unload the animals to help them the next day; much to Francis' chagrin.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Swiss Family Robinson}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Robinson, Fritz}}\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Swiss Family Robinson characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]"
