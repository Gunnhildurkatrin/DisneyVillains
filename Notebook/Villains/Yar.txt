You keep [[Aladar|that thing]], one day, we'll turn our backs, it'll be picking us out of its teeth! Things like THAT eat things like US as snacks!|Yar|Dinosaur}}\n\n'''Yar''' is an elderly lemur and a supporting character from Disney's [[2000]] CGI film ''[[Dinosaur]]''.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nYar cares for his family and is slightly overprotective of his son, [[Zini]], when a fallen egg is discovered by his daughter, [[Plio]], she frees the baby dinosaur from it's shell, and decides to keep it and names him [[Aladar]], Yar seems uneasy about this at first, but he still reluctantly accepts the hatchling. When Aladar grows up, Yar is more laid-back with his family and happily accepts Aladar as one of them.\n\nDespite being overprotective of his family and paranoid when Pilo is the first to find baby Aladar Yar can't drop the baby out of the tree to kill it. As strict and tough as he Yar ends up liking the bady Iguanodon after hanging Aladar back over to Pilo Yar becomes worried that the baby might get hurt. When Pilo sees that her father turtly cares for the child Yar parents to act like he is worried that the baby dinosaur will hurt the other lemurs.\n\nYears later after Aladar Yar is seen teaching the young male lemurs how to impress the females since he is their leader and describes himself as the master when it comes attracting a mate. Yar is the authority figure for the one who rules over where the lemurs live. Eventhough Yar still gives the orders and is protective the old lemur has grown to like Aladar and treats him as a member of their clan. After the courtship with males and females when the meteor shower beings Yar starts stuffing the air and listening he is the first one to notice that something's wrong.\n\nBecause of his protective nature Yar can sense the danger while everyone is amazed with all the meteors they see. Although Yar doesn't know what the danger is he just knows something bad is about to happen and he was right. As soon as the destination begins Aladar starts grabbing his family to get them to safety while trying to escape Yar has trouble keeping up since he is old and trips over a rock. After Aladar gets them to safety and being in a location they don't know Yar holds Pilo, Zini and Suri really close to him through the whole film to keep them safe.\n\nYar tries to cheer Suri up who is still shaken up after what happened but when Aladar is curious about a creature he has never seen before he wants to cheek it out. Because he is cautious Yar tries to stop his adopted son from following the animal since they don't know what it is. Wanting to keep his family safe and to proud to admit he is scared Yar lies trying to say that Suri is scared of the mysterious dinosaur they saw but Suri it's afraid and is curious.\n\nAfter Yar learned that he was right not to go near the dinosaurs which happened to be volciraptors when the family get separated from each other after running into a heard of dinosaurs. Zini is impressed with seeing so many dinosaurs Yar protects him from being stepped on by asking Zini to keep his head down. At first Yar refuses to join the herd because he still doesn't trust other dinosaurs the raptors change his mind. After making some new friends when Baylene and Eema don't know what the lemurs are Yar is the first one to quickly speak up.\n\nAlthough Yar stubborn he can't stand Kron who happens to be more stubborn then the old lemur. Upon first meeting Kron Yar instantly doesn't like him Yar doesn't want to follow Kron's orders but Aladar reminds Yar it's better to put with rude leader of the heard than to deal with the volciraptors. Well mostly staying close to his family through their long journey to keep them safe Yar does help out Eema who does stray off from the rest of the group. Yar has become protective and beings to care for the new friends he and his family meet during their travel.\n\nOriginally someone who hated dinosaurs and wasn't very trusting always keeping his defenses and guard up Yar becomes less hostile and more laid-back eventually being ok hanging around the dinosaurs. At the beginning of the film Yar knew dinosaurs were dangerous and meat eaters but after meeting Aladar and eventually the dinosaur heard Yar eventually learns that not all dinosaurs bad, scary and dangerous. Although Yar becomes more friendly, easygoing and funny as well through the rest of the film Yar still remains strict, firm, cautious and protective.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Dinosaur]]''===\nYar is first seen in the movie when a dinosaur egg falls on [[Lemur Island]], where he lives with his daughter [[Plio]], his granddaughter [[Suri]], and his son [[Zini]]. As the other lemurs gather around the fallen egg, Zini tries to get closer but Yar stops him, telling him it's not safe. Plio is present when the egg cracks, then opens the shell and is happy to see a baby [[Iguanodon]]. She holds the baby in her hands and decides that she will raise him. Yar objects because he says that one day he will eat them and tells Plio to get rid of the creature. Plio apologizes to the baby and lets Yar do it himself. He holds up the baby dinosaur and attempts to drop it, though is unable to bring himself to do it after looking at the newborn and seeing how harmless and peaceful it is, but then the baby urinates on him. Disgusted, he hands the hatchling back to Plio, and she reaffirms him that the baby will learn not to eat meat; she names the baby [[Aladar]]. Yar reluctantly lets her keep the hatchling and tells Plio to watch his head, out of concern for the baby's well-being, but hides this by warning her that he may bite.\n\nThe years pass and Aladar has grown up a vegetarian dinosaur, thanks to Plio's care. That night, Yar is explaining to the male lemurs about the mating ritual, while Plio is having a similar pep talk with the female lemurs. After the ritual, Plio is present when a fireball falls from the sky, causing violent tremors. Other fireballs soon start falling, destroying the island. Plio urges Aladar to run and he takes her, Yar, Suri and Zini on his back, and they escape the island by jumping across the sea to the mainland. Yar and the others are devastated that everyone on the island was killed by the fireballs, and that he and his family are the last ones of their kind.\n\nFor the next few days, they wander through deserted lands until they find a dinosaur herd led by [[Kron]], his second-in-command [[Bruton]] and his sister [[Neera]]. Yar and the others learn that the herd is going to the [[Nesting Grounds]]. There, they befriend some of the elder dinosaurs: [[Baylene]], [[Eema]] and [[Url]] who are at the end of the herd because they are too old to follow the rhythm of the others. Plio is the first to notice that her son Aladar has fallen in love with Neera.\n\nAfter several days of rough marching, Bruton (who had been attacked by [[Carnotaurus|Carnotaurs]]) informs Kron that Carnotaurs are following them so Kron decides to accelerate the pace, not caring if someone is left behind. Because of this, Aladar, the lemurs, Baylene, Eema and Url separate from the herd. On a rainy night, they find shelter in a cave. They also find a wounded Bruton who has been banished from the herd by Kron. Yar points out that Bruton is one of them, but Aladar tells him otherwise after helping a reluctant Bruton into the cave. While Plio tends to Bruton's wounds, he asks her why she is giving them false hopes, but Plio reassures him that hope is the last thing that gets lost and that he is welcome to follow them. That night when two Carnotaurs attack them, everyone manages to escape deeper in the cave, but Bruton dies in the process while saving them, and the entrance of the cave is blocked by the falling rocks.\n\nLater, after wandering for hours in the cave, Suri and Zini start smelling something. Plio and Yar smell the same thing, and so they start digging through the rocks to discover a ray of light; however, more rocks fall and cover the exit. Aladar screams in frustration and gives up, but Baylene says that they didn't come this far only to give up, and so everyone starts to push the rocks until they discover something amazing: they have arrived at the Nesting Grounds. Plio is happy that they have finally arrived at their new home, and she with Yar watch happily as Suri, Zini and Baylene jump into the lake. Aladar then goes to warn the rest of the herd about the cave entrance.\n\nMonths later, Yar becomes a great-grandfather when Aladar and Neera have their babies. He holds up a newly-hatched Iguanodon who urinates on him the same way Aladar once did. Yar just smiles and ironically tells the baby that he is definitely his father's son.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\">\nYar Clipart.gif|Yar clipart\nYar.jpg\nChar_14970.jpg\nImagezy.jpg|Yar with his son Zini\nDinosaur-disneyscreencaps.com-751.jpg\nDinosaur-disneyscreencaps.com-2666.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Dinosaur}}\n[[pt-br:Yar]]\n[[Category:Dinosaur characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Grandparents]]\n[[Category:Lemurs]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric animals]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric characters]]"
