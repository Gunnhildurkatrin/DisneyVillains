However, unlike Greek legends, they are depicted as little boys, possibly to reflect their child-like natures. The Satyrs' hair and legs are in a various arrangement of colors, most often in delicate pastel colors to reflect on the segment's title.\n\n===Personality===\nNot much is known about their personality, but what can be gathered, from their body language, is that they are child-like and innocent.\n\n==Role in the film==\nThe satyrs make their debut frolicking in the flower fields and open-air temples of ancient Greece along with their friends, the [[Unicorns]], playing and generally having a good time. They attend a wine festival with the [[Centaurs (Fantasia)|Centaurs]], [[Centaurettes]], [[Cherubs (Fantasia)|Cherubs]], Unicorns, [[Bacchus (Fantasia)|Bacchus]], [[Jacchus]], And the zebra centaurettes, soon their fun was spoiled when [[Zeus (Fantasia)|Zeus]] came to ruin everything, when the storm stop, they (along with the cherubs, unicorns, [[Peter Pegasus]], and the [[Pegasi Siblings]]) play in [[Iris (goddess)|Iris]]' Rainbow, then one satyr goes to sleep with [[Brudus]], and [[Melinda]] under a tree after [[Morpheus (Fantasia)|Morpheus]] arrived.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\">\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps.com-9469.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps com-6648.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps com-6663.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps com-6664.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps com-6683.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps com-6700.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps com-6714.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps com-6719.jpg\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps com-6723.jpg\nFantasiaSatyrs2.jpg|Concept art of the fauns.\nFantasiaSatyr4.jpg|Concept art of a faun playing music.\nPegasusAndSatyrs.jpg|The fauns and pegasi in a color piece.\nFantasia CentuarsSatyrs.jpg|Concept art from the Pastoral scene.\n7511002529640 original.jpeg|Satyr [[Vinylmation]]\nDSA-Satyrs.png|Models for [[Disney Sorcerer's Arena]]\n</gallery>\n\n{{Fantasia}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Satyrs}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Fantasia characters]]\n[[Category:Goats]]\n[[Category:Hybrids]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Greek Mythology]]\n[[Category:Greek characters]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Fauns and Satyrs]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Disney Sorcerer's Arena Characters]]"
