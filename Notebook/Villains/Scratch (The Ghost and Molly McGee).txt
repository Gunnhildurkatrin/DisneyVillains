When one of his spells backfired, he finds himself forever cursed in [[Molly McGee|Molly's]] presence (as long as she stays in Brighton), to his immediate displeasure.\n\n==Powers and Abilities==\nScratch possesses several powers commonly associated with ghosts:\n*'''Levitation:''' He can fly and hover off the ground.\n*'''Telekinesis:''' He can move people and objects without touching them. Upon meeting Molly for the first time, he used this ability to force her to leave his attic.\n*'''Intangibility:''' He can move through solid objects.\n*'''Invisibility:''' He can render himself invisible to others, using it to stay undetected at Molly's school. However, he remains visible to animals.\n*'''Shapeshifting:''' Being made of ectoplasm, he can manipulate his body into any shape he desires. He mainly uses this ability to appear scarier and can turn into a fully functioning human leg.\n**'''Elasticity:''' His body and limbs can be stretched seemingly without limit. Molly exploits this by using his arm to pull him towards her. \n*'''Regeneration:''' His body is made of a seemingly limitless supply of ectoplasmic goo. This is first seen when he angrily covered Molly and her family in ectoplasm, showing no ill effects afterwards.\n*'''Curse inducement:''' He can curse anyone to be haunted by him for an eternity. However, it has the opposite effect on Molly, who sees it as an opportunity to have an eternal best friend.\n*'''Possession/Overshadowing:''' He can possess and control people and inanimate objects to varying degrees. On Molly's first day at school, he possessed Andrea Davenport to convince the other students to accept Molly and Libby Stein-Torres and not bully them. Later, he took control of the Lemmings' equipment to help them win the state championship.\n*'''Invulnerability:''' As he is already dead, poisonous substances have no effect on him. On Molly's camping trip, he consumed several poison berries with no harmful effects.\n*'''Portal creation:''' He can create and travel through portals to the ghost world.\n*'''4th Wall Awareness:''' Seen only in the intro, Scratch is somewhat aware he is a fictional character. He attempted to personally rewind the online video the intro song was being played on, without success.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==External links==\n*[[w:c:theghostandmollymcgee:Scratch|Scratch]] at the [[w:c:theghostandmollymcgee|The Ghost and Molly McGee Wiki]]\n\n{{The Ghost and Molly McGee}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Scratch}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Scratch}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Deuteragonists]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Ghost and Molly McGee characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Spirits]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Disney All-Star Racers characters]]"
