At 8 years old and the eldest of the Otter children, Peanut is smart and can be a bit funny at times, but always loyal. He would normally rather not dance, especially the [[Noodle Dance]], but he ends up doing it anyway, even on some occasions, he would want to dance.\n\nPeanut is best friends with [[Munchy Beaver]] and [[Flick Duck]], and he's into the Mallard Man\u00a0comic books. He often helps out his sister [[Jelly Otter|Jelly]], and they hug in some episodes in each season when they want to comfort each other.\u00a0\n\n==Disney's Hollywood Studios==\nThe puppet versions of Peanut and Jelly appeared on the Playhouse Disney car during the [[Disney Stars and Motor Cars Parade]].\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nPBJ-peanut smile.jpg\nGood Clean Fun.png\nPeanut begging.png|Peanut is pleading Pinch\nPeanut n Jelly confess.png\nScrubba Dubba.png\nTa-Da Baby Butter.png\nWell done Butter.png\nDetective Peanut and Jelly.jpg|Peanut and Jelly as detectives.\nWaiter PBnJ.jpg|The Otter children as waiters.\nMunchy and Peanut.PNG|Peanut & Munchy\nPeanut Munchy and Flick scream.PNG|Parched\nFlick apologizes.PNG\nLemon Song.png\nPeanut.PNG\nWeebee.PNG|Peanut with a glass of lemonade.\nOtter.PNG\nImaginings.png|Peanut looking above the clouds with [[Jelly]] and [[Butter]]\nP&J Outside.PNG|Peanut is barefoot outside with Jelly.\nPBJ Noodle 003.png|Noodle dance\nPBJ Noodle 002.png|Noodle dance 2\nDown in ole hoohaw.jpg\nMrs. Otter reading a story.PNG\nIce moose.PNG\nWhat are we gonna do.PNG\nBaby Peanut & Jelly.jpg\nBetteragain07.png\nPB&J fun.PNG\nSooch.PNG\nP&J Snooties.PNG\nPeanut and Flick with grass skirts.PNG\nJelly, Pinch, Flick, and Peanut.PNG\nPeanut playing the coconut drum.PNG\nVlcsnap-2013-01-28-09h22m47s219.png\nHoohaw.PNG\nAdventure boat.PNG\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{PB&J Otter}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Otter, Peanut}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:PB&J Otter characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Playhouse Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Otters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Nephews]]"
