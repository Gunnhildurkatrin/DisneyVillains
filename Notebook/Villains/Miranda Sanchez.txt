The Halloween episode shows her family celebrating The Day of the Dead. She also knows some Spanish when the gang attempt to go on a Spanish game show, but not enough to be very helpful.\n\nShe is shown babysitting a baby sister in one episode; this is the only sibling she is portrayed as having in the series, but a planned spin-off for which a pilot episode was filmed but never aired featured Miranda's sister, Stevie Sanchez, as the titular character and made her just a few years younger than Miranda.\n\nNear the end of the series, Miranda appeared less in the show, although she appeared in the final episode. She was, however, absent from ''[[The Lizzie McGuire Movie]]'', which went to theaters in 2003.\n\nShe did not appear in ''[[The Lizzie McGuire Movie]]'' was due to her vacationing in [[Mexico]].\n\n\n==Trivia==\n*In 4th Grade, Miranda snacked on puppy's biscuits.\n*Miranda is of Mexican heritage in comparison to the Filipino Lalaine in reality.\n*It is revealed in \"Misadventures in Babysitting\" that she has a baby sister, but her infant sister was never seen in the series.\n*Her parents are Edward and [[Daniella Sanchez]], and she has a sister, Stevie, as revealed later when Disney Channel announced the spin-off show about her sister, What's Stevie Thinking, starring [[Selena Gomez]] as Stevie (though the show never aired).\n*Miranda is smart and witty and sometimes doesn't get along with Gordo. She and Lizzie were friends with Kate for a while, but Kate gained popularity and became their nemesis.\n*Matt had a crush on her in the episode, \"Working Girl\".\n*<span style=\"line-height:21px;\">She was born on December 15, 1989.</span>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sanchez, Miranda}}\n\n{{Lizzie McGuire}}\n[[Category:Lizzie McGuire characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Lizzie McGuire]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
