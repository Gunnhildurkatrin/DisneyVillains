They often get mixed up for one another, though they claim to be completely different. They were the newest members of [[Sofia the First (character)|Sofia's]] [[Buttercups|Buttercups troop]] until Amber joined.\n\nMeg and Peg make their second appearance in the episode, \"[[Mystic Meadows]]\" along with the other Buttercups as they visit the retirement home for retired sorcerers. In \"[[Buttercup Amber]]\" they have shown that they can act independent of one another, seeing as one spotted Mossy and the other stood there in shock.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Technically, Meg's full name is \"Megan.\"\n*Peg's name came from the French word for a daisy or a pearl.\n*They are voiced by the same person who originally voiced [[Ruby Hanshaw|Ruby]] in ''[[Sofia the First: Once Upon a Princess]]'', who like them is also a Buttercups scout and friend of [[Sofia the First (character)|Sofia]]. Fiona Bishop also voices a Princess.\n*Meg and Peg are the second twins to appear in the series, the first was [[Princess Amber|Amber]] and [[Prince James|James]] who are also fraternal twins. Also, the second twins to have blond hair.\n*For some reason, they are always shown wearing their Buttercup uniforms even when not on Buttercup missions.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nThe Buttercups 2.jpg\nSofia-the-First-Episode-15-The-Buttercups.jpg|Learning to tie a friendship knot\nMystic-Meadows-4.png\nMystic-Meadows-27.png\nButtercup-Amber-23.png\nButtercup-Amber-7.png|Meg and Peg find Amber's underwear\nButtercup-Amber-9.png\nButtercup-Amber-43.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Sofia the First}}\n[[Category:Sofia the First characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Scouts]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Twins and Triplets]]\n[[Category:Character stubs]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
