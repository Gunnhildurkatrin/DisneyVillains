He is the most \"beautiful\" of all the [[Pub Thugs]]. He is a hopeless romantic, with the tendency to be constantly abused by Hook Hand. His dream is to find love in someone who can see his inner beauty.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nTrue to his romantic nature, Big Nose is amongst the more innocent and humble of the thugs. He tends to see the beauty in everything\u2014whether it be art, nature, people, or individual skills. He also appears to be fairly educated, at least more so than his companions; in ''Tangled: The Series'', it is shown that Big Nose is well-versed in Corona's history. As a master poet, he is also well-spoken, and tends to speak in a philosophical manner.\n\nBig Nose's more aggressive, thuggish side was only seen briefly during the bridge of \"[[I've Got a Dream]]\" in the original ''Tangled''.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Tangled]]''===\nBig Nose is first seen during \"I've Got a Dream\", where he expresses his various shortcomings while also hoping to find true love. In the end, he receives his wish after meeting a woman during the epilogue celebration.\n===''[[Tangled Ever After]]''===\nHe returns in ''Tangled Ever After'', seen attending Rapunzel and Eugene's wedding\n===''[[Tangled: Before Ever After]]''===\nBig Nose is seen in [[Corona Castle]] during Eugene's verse of \"[[Life After Happily Ever After]]\". He, along with most of the main thugs, appears to have become one of Eugene's closest companions outside of Rapunzel and Maximus. During the scene, Big Nose is shown enjoying a spa treatment. He is also the only thug to actually speak\n===''[[Tangled: The Series]]''===\nIn \"[[What the Hair?!]]\", it is noted that Big Nose's girlfriend (seen during the original film's epilogue) is named Assunta, and his gushing about their mutual love is a regular nuisance to the other thugs (except for Shorty).\n\nIn \"[[Fitzherbert P.I.]]\", Eugene vents to the Pub Thugs about [[Cassandra (Tangled)|Cassandra]]'s claim that all he's good at is thieving. The thugs' silence indicte that they agree, offending Eugene. Big Nose tries to provide damage control by claiming that they don't agree, but have arrive at a place of agreement.\nIn \"[[Great Expotations]]\", Big Nose was amongst the competitors of the science expo, though the judge quickly dismissed his invention. He is later seen helping Shorty, Rapunzel, Eugene, Cassandra and Varian in helping stop the latter's and [[Fernanda Pizazzo]]'s inventions after they go berserk.\n\nIn \"[[Under Raps]]\", Big Nose narrated the opening sequence that followed Corona's history with its then-rival kingdom, Saporia. He then goes on to explain the Day of Love festival held within the kingdom every year, which will play a pivotal role in the rest of the episode.\n\nIn \"[[One Angry Princess]]\", Attila is accused of vandalizing [[Monty (Tangled)|Uncle Monty]]'s shop. Rapunzel volunteers to prove Attila's innocence, and during her search, she encounters [[Old Lady Crowley]], who claims to have seen Attila rummaging through her plumbago garden at the time of the vandalism, making it impossible for him to be the criminal responsible. When Crowley testifies the following morning, the [[Captain of the Guards]] asks her to point out the thug she saw in her garden. When she does, she points to Big Nose, who shamefully admits it was he who plucked from Crowley's garden. When informed that she confused Big Nose and Attila, Crowley scornfully scoffs that all the thugs look the same.\n\n==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==\n===[[Shanghai Disneyland]]===\nBig Nose's likeness appears on the ''Tangled''-themed float in the park's daytime parade, ''[[Mickey's Storybook Express]]''.\n\n===[[Disney Cruise Line]]===\nAboard the [[Disney Fantasy]], Big Nose appears alongside the other Pub Thugs during the \"I've Got a Dream\" segment of ''[[Wishes (Disney Fantasy)|Wishes]]'', in which he plays out a similar role as he did in the film. Big Nose plays a similar role in ''[[Tangled: The Musical]]'', aboard the [[Disney Magic]].\n\n==Trivia==\n*Big Nose is the only major Pub Thug that did not take part of the prison breakout in the original film.\n*The crest on Big Nose's chest armor is in the shape of a heart, symbolizing his romantic nature.\n*He has had two different love interests; one is Assunta, who appears at the end of the film, and the other is a woman named Rhonda who is mentioned in [[The Wrath of Ruthless Ruth]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\ntangled-disneyscreencaps_com-10603.jpg\nWhat the Hair 19.jpg\nTangled - Big Nose.png\nGreat Expotations - Big Nose.png\nBig Brothers of Corona 60.png\nOne Angry Princess 9.png\nOne Angry Princess 15.png\nOne Angry Princess 18.png\nOne Angry Princess 20.png\nOne Angry Princess 55.png\nThe-Wrath-of-Ruthless-Ruth-9.png\nThe Way of the Willow 32.jpg\nThe Way of the Willow 39.jpeg\nBeginnings (28).jpg\nThe King and Queen of Hearts (43).jpg\n6248307552 c6eca8b4de z.jpg|Big Nose in ''[[Disney On Ice]]''\n</gallery>\n\n{{Tangled}}\n{{Disney Crossy Road}}\n{{DisneyTsumTsum}}\n[[Category:Tangled characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Characters who narrate the story]]\n[[Category:Disney Crossy Road characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
