"\n[[File:ReplicANT4.png|thumb]]'''Nigel'''\u00a0is a character who appears in\u00a0ReplicANT. He is a student from [[London]]. He's also an artistic genius, as in drama, and used a robot to attend school remotely. He is an\u00a0A.N.T. who\u00a0Chyna\u00a0had a crush on, which caused\u00a0Fletcher\u00a0to become jealous and try to ruin their date. By the end of the episode,\u00a0Chyna\u00a0said she wasn't ready for a boyfriend who was a robot. She hoped that one day they would meet in person. He is portrayed by Noah Alexander Gerry. The strange thing about Nigel is he attends the American A.N.T. as a robot, because it is to far away, but in EndurANTs, it was revealed that there are A.N.T. programs in many countries, specifically in England.\n[[Category:A.N.T.
