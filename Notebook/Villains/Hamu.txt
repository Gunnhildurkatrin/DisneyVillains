Typical of zebra foals, he has long, thin legs. He has baby blue eyes, a white and black striped coat, and a short black and white ridge of hair along his neck and head. His ear tips, muzzle, hooves, and tail tuft are black, with pink ear lobes. He has a triangular black mark in between his eyes that end before his muzzle.\n\n== Personality ==\nHamu has been shown to be a strong foal with a very playful nature and a tendency to be loud. Hamu has shown great bravery and has impressive strength in his back legs. He pays close attention to what he has been told and learns new skills quickly.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== ''[[The Mbali Fields Migration]]'' ===\nHamu is born in the\u00a0Outlands\u00a0as his mother makes her way to\u00a0Mbali Fields. Shortly after his birth, he lets loose a loud bray, which draws\u00a0Janja,\u00a0Cheezi,\u00a0and\u00a0Chungu's\u00a0attention.\u00a0Bunga\u00a0tries to tell the newborn to be quiet, even though he knows that he probably won't be able to understand him. However, the three hyenas soon arrive and slide down the ridge, causing most of the zebras to scatter.\u00a0Kion pleads with everyone to protect Muhimu and her newborn, knowing that mayhem is\u00a0exactly what the hyenas want from them.\n\nAfter Muhimu orders them to, the zebras compose themselves, rushing back to Muhimu and her foal, defending them along with Kion, Bunga, and Swala. At first Janja, Cheezi and Chungu taunt them, though they soon launch an attack. Janja is caught by Kion, and Bunga catches Cheezi. Chungu aims for the zebras but is kicked back by a zebra. Chungu, in turn, pushes Kion off Janja as they are thrust away. Janja approaches the zebras, who pull back a little, though Hamu kicks Janja in the face, throwing him away at the same time Bunga and Kion finish with Cheezi and Chungu.\u00a0\n\nMuhimu is amazed that her son saved her life, and Bunga compliments him. The remaining animals finally make it to Mbali Fields, with everyone safe and happy at last. Hamu approaches the Lion Guard who are relieved themselves that their journey is over, and\u00a0Beshte\u00a0welcomes him to the\u00a0Circle of Life. He nickers and rears up on his hind legs, and Bunga agrees with him. The two race away and play together in the herds' new home.\u00a0\n\n=== [[Babysitter Bunga]] ===\nHe appears with his herd being attacked by [[Reirei's Pack]] and but ends up being separated from his mother, then chased by Dogo and his sister. Even though, Bunga and Ono stopped Dogo's Sister; Dogo jumped on Hamu and Bunga told him to kick the pup away while the others chased the jackals off.\n\nMuhimu is still spooked about what happened Beshte suggests she takes time for herself while her son is watched by Bunga to which the Honey Badge agrees too. So Bunga takes Hamu to Hakuna Matata Falls to play and soon he's greeted by other baby animals and they are taught Teke, Ruka, Teleza. Just in time too because they fail to notice the jackal's attack. But with what they learned from Bunga the kids were able to protect themselves just fine when the rest of the guard appears Hamu and Bunga explain that everything is okay. A bit later, Hamu tells his mother what happened with Muhimu being impressed and the kids leave after saying goodbye to Bunga.\n\n== Relationships ==\n\n=== Family ===\n[[Muhimu]]\n\nHamu and his mother Muhimu have a close relationship, and she despairs whenever he is in a dangerous situation as seen when the hyenas attack, but is very proud of him, as seen when he kicks Janja during the fight to protect her and when he and his friends defeat the jackals she was amazed.\n\n=== Friends ===\n[[Bunga]]\n\nThe two are close friends as Bunga was there when Hamu was born and played together in his herd's new home. When Hamu was separated from the rest of his herd by the jackals Bunga went to rescue him. Once Hamu has been located, Bunga is quick to take down\u00a0 Kijana, who is sneaking up on the youngster from behind. Soon after Bunga calls for Hamu to kick as Dogo approaches, and he does so by kicking Dogo into the bush. Bunga even taught him and some other young Pride Land animals to defeat [[Reirei's Pack]].\n\n[[Juhudi]]\n\nHamu and Juhudi have a great relationship. After hearing that Bunga is watching Hamu for a while Twiga asks him if she can watch her daughter as well. The kids spend the whole day playing at Hakuna Matata Falls.\n\n[[Young Rhino]]\n\nHamu and Young Rhino have a great relationship.

His mane becomes longer than in his debut and he is more similar to\u00a0[[Kwato]], likely due to an advancement in age.\n*He didn't have an official\u00a0name until Babysitter Bunga.\n\n{{The Lion King}}\n[[Category:The Lion Guard characters]]\n[[Category:Zebras]]\n[[Category:Infants]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:African characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
