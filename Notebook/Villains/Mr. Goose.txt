As it becomes human, the goose protests that he can't drive, causing [[Cinderella (character)|Ella]] to giggle.\n\nNonetheless, the goose coachman manages to drive Ella to the royal palace and drives Ella out afterward to the best of his abilities.\n\nLike the [[Lizard Footmen|lizard footmen]], even in human form, the goose coachman still retains goose characteristics in terms of his coloring (orange stockings representing goose legs and a white overcoat representing feathers).\n\nHe is later seen on the balcony with the [[mice]] and lizards as Ella and [[Prince Charming|Kit]] are married.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Cinderella}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Goose}}\n[[Category:Cinderella characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Geese]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Servants]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:European characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in remakes]]"
