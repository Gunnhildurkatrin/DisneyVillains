'''Experiment 609''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]]. He is designed to fire orange heat lasers from the black oval-shaped bulb on his forehead. He was captured by [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]], but was rescued in \"[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]\".\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment 609 was the 609th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to shoot orange heat rays from the large bulb on his forehead. 609 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.\n\n609's pod eventually made its way to a junk shop, where it, along with [[Hammerface|033]], [[Thresher|544]], and [[Plasmoid|617]], was discovered, stolen, activated, and named Heat by [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] in \"[[Dupe (episode)|Dupe]]\".\n\nBack at [[Gantu's Ship|his ship]], Gantu trained and conditioned Hammerface, Heat, Thresher, and Plasmoid\u00a0by using [[Reuben|Experiment 625]] for target practice, much to his indignity. The four henchmen experiments were then led by Gantu in an attack on the [[Lilo's House|Pelekais' house]], where their boss ordered them\u00a0to defeat and capture [[Stitch]] and his replicas after seeing that he had been split into four.\n\nHeat engaged one of the clones in a duel. The clone picked up the couch to use as a weapon, but as he only possessed one-fourth of the original Stitch's strength, picking it up was a struggle for him.\u00a0Seeing his chance, Heat used his heat ray to carve a hole in the bottom\u00a0of the couch, and due to the sudden imbalance, it collapsed on top of the clone. Gantu then picked the latter up and placed him in a containment orb.\n\nAfter capturing\u00a0Stitch and his duplicates, the five returned to Gantu's ship for a victory feast (courtesy of Reuben), but were interrupted by [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Pleakley]], and [[Dupe]]. After Lilo tricked Gantu into using Dupe's cloning ability, Gantu used Dupe to clone Heat into a hundred replicas. However, as Heat's power was divided among them, they all became complete weaklings, and thus were easily defeated.\n\nPresumably after this, they were all sent to [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]] who was somehow able to re-merge\u00a0the weakling Heat clones into the original.\n\nIn \"[[Remmy (episode)|Remmy]]\",\u00a0Heat was one of the experiments in Lilo's dream.\n\nHeat reappeared in \"[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]\", and was freed along with Gantu's other captive experiments by Lilo, Stitch, and several other experiments in a rescue mission.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nThe first 624 experiments, including Heat, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]] and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nHeat participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]].\n\nThe Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.\n\n===''[[Stitch!]]''===\nHeat made an appearance in a later episode of the ''Stitch!'' anime along with [[Swapper]], both of whom [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]] used in another plot. Heat was mistaken for [[Splodyhead]] by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]]. Swapper switched [[Stitch]] and [[Hiroman]]'s bodies. Then, when Heat attacked, Hiroman required to figure out how to use Stitch's abilities to win. Heat later appeared in the special ''Stitch and the Planet of Sand''.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Heat is one of the\u00a0ten known experiments named by someone other than Lilo, the other\u00a0nine being [[Gigi]], [[Elastico]], [[Yaarp]], [[Hammerface]], [[Thresher]], [[Plasmoid]], [[Morpholomew]], [[Shrink]], and [[Leroy]].\n*Even though we saw Heat in\u00a0[[Experiment Pods|pod]] form along with Plasmoid, Thresher, and Hammerface, he was the only one activated onscreen.\n*In the English dub of the ''[[Stitch!]]'' anime episode \"Swapper 2.0\", Jumba erroneously refers to Heat as \"[[Splodyhead]]\".\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
