Unlike the other experiments Jumba created in China, Dim Long does not live in the pocket dimension he created to house them. Instead, he lives with Jumba, [[Stitch]], and [[Pleakley]] at [[Wang Ai Ling|Ai]]'s family home making him a recurring character in ''[[Stitch & Ai]]''.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Dim Long is the first experiment Jumba created in China that was created specifically as a beta test creature for another experiment.\n*He looks similar to [[Mushu]].  \n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Dragons]]\n[[Category:Chinese characters]]"
