She is featured in Minnie \u2018n Me; a merchandising line of products. They were collector\u2019s cards and books designed for pre-teen girls. She forms a trio with Minnie and Daisy, much like the trio of [[Mickey]], [[Donald]] and [[Goofy]].\n\n==Trivia==\n*There is fan speculation that she could possibly be the (future) [[Mrs. Goof]] and mother of [[Max Goof]]. This is based off the fact that she has red hair and a reddish nose like the description of the mysterious Mrs. Goof.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pooch, Penny}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Goofy]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]"
