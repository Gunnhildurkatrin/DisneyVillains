When [[Donald Duck]] found his diary in Villa Rosa, this inspired him to become [[The Duck Avenger]].\n\n\n\nGuido Martina scarcely used the character, since his role was limited to be Donald's inspiration, but Italian Disney comic artist and writer Marco Gervasio expanded on the character and his background, at first as part of flashbacks in Duck Avenger stories and later with a mini-series happening in the past. Fantomius lived in Villa Rosa with his fianc\u00e9e and partner in crime [[Dolly Paprika|Dolly Duck a.k.a. Dolly Paprika]].\n\nSome Danish comics show an aged yet still living FantomAllard who returns to Duckburg to test his successor, but he mistakenly believes [[Gladstone Gander]] to be the Duck Avenger, as Gladstone was the original inheritor of Villa Rosa.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nLord Lamont John Quackett.jpg|Fantomius' secret identity, Lord John Lamont Quackett.\nDuck Avenger & Fantomius.jpg|The Duck Avenger faces an older  \"Danish variant\" of Fantomius.\nfantomallard by Romano Scarpa.jpg|Donald Duck with Fantomius outfit by Romano Scarpa 1970\nfantomallard and Dolly Paprika.jpg|Fantomius and Dolly Paprika by Marco Gervasio 2014\nfantomallard.jpg|Donald Duck with Fantomius costume by Romano Scarpa 1970\nvilla rosa.jpg|Fantomius and Dolly Paprika in Villa Rosa by Marco Gervasio 2012\nFantomius_COVER_MATITE.jpg|Fantomius, Dolly Paprika and Copernicus Gearloose by Marco Gervasio 2012\ndolly paprika.jpg|Daisy and Gladstone pretend to be Dolly Paprika and Fantomius by Romano Scarpa 1970\n</gallery>\n{{Donald-Series}}\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Superheroes]]"
