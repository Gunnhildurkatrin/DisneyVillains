His first name is Jonathan.\n==Background==\nJonathan attended the secret super power school [[Sky High School]]. At Sky High, he attended the sidekick classes. Upon graduation, he was paired with [[The Commander]] and became his Hero Support. The Commander chose the name All American Boy for Jonathan. The Commander also chose All American Boy's Uniform and colors so it would match his own Uniform. All American Boy once saved The Commander's life. Probably soon after The Commander met and partnered with [[Jetstream]], All American Boy stopped being the Commander's sidekick.\n===Powers and abilities===\nAll American Boy can leap across vast distances, as shown when he caught Jetstream when the latter was Pacified, before she could fall to her death, a fall which would have been fatal owing to the fact she was a baby.\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Sky High]]''===\nJonathan now works as Hero Support teacher at Sky High. Though he tries to appear chipper and tries to inspire his students he is quite clearly unhappy and living in past glory. At some point he made and gave scrapbooks for The Commander. He is saddened that [[Will Stronghold]] didn't know who he was even though he worked with his father. He still does a little freelance Hero Support on the side.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\">\nAll American Boy Class.jpg\nAll American Boy.jpg\nThe Commander Poster.jpg\nMr. Boy.jpg\nMr Boy.jpg\n161783 full.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Sky High}}\n[[Category:Sky High characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Schoolteachers]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Superheroes]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"
