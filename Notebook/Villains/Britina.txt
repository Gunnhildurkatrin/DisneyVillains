She admittedly missed out on typical teen experiences, such as school dances, and this may be part of why she was such good friends with [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim Possible]], who in turn did not mind sharing details of her own high school troubles.\n\n===Abilities===\nBritina is an apparently talented singer and/or performer.\n\n==Role in the Series==\nBritina gave Team Possible a ride to [[Tokyo]] as thanks for saving her Chicago show from a fire backstage. Kim admitted she was scared of approaching [[Josh Mankey]], to which Britina advised her to just go for it. Ron then asked Britina to be his date for a school dance, but she turned him down.\n\nBritina's doll line was endangered when the engine was stolen from the factory production floor by the Bebe robots. A little girl named Midge reported on Kim's website that her local store was out of Britina dolls, alerting Wade to a nation-wide shortage of the dolls. Team Possible intervened and shut the Bebes down for the second time.\n\nDespite her latest successful CD, \"Hail Britina\", going double-platinum\u2013and therefore not hurting for finances\u2013Britina was falsely accused of stealing cash from a safe of the \"Born to Shop\" reality show's wrap party. Sent to jail, she contacted Team Possible for help.\n\nTeam Possible discovered that Britina's rumored friend, Camille Leon\u2013one of the stars on \"Born to Shop\"\u2013had been disinherited and was a common factor in a recent string of similar \"celeb gone bad\" robberies. Jim and Tim Possible eventually exposed Camille as a shape-shifter.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The title of Britina's double platinum album CD \"Hail Britina\" is an allusion to the British patriotic music \"Hail Britannia\", also known as \"Rule! Britannia\".\n*She is considered to be based off of a mixture of Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nCrush (10).jpg\nBritina_In_Jail.jpg\nBritina-doll.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Kim Possible}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Kim Possible characters]]\n[[Category:Singers]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]"
