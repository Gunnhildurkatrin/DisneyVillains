Thank you, man!|Hermes to Hercules while fighting Pain and Panic}}\n'''Hermes''' is an [[Olympian Gods|Olympian God]], serving as a royal messenger of the Gods, from the [[1997]] animated feature film, ''[[Hercules (film)|Hercules]]''.\n\n==Background==\n===Powers and abilities===\nAs a god, Hermes possesses the natural powers and abilities such as immortality, omnipresence, superhuman strength, and magic.\n* '''Magic''' - Hermes uses magic via the Caduceus (his staff).\n* '''Flight''' - As the messenger of the Gods and God of travelers, the winged sandals enable Hermes to fly and move at an extreme speed.\n* '''Super Speed'''\u00a0- Hermes can fly or simply move his body extremely fast, quick enough to perform tasks like cooking in a few seconds.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Hercules (film)|Hercules]]''===\nHermes is first seen at [[Hercules (character)|Hercules]]' baby shower, where he brings [[Hera]] flowers and compliments [[Zeus (Hercules)|Zeus]] on the festivities. He is also seen when Hades enters the festivities.\n\nLater on, Hermes catches sight of the [[Titans]] returning to [[Mount Olympus]] and quickly alerts Zeus, Hera, and the other gods for battle. He is the last god (aside from Zeus) to be captured, being kidnapped by [[Pain and Panic]]; the latter steals his glasses while the former barks into his ear. After Hercules arrives and frees the gods, Hermes regains his glasses and beats the imps with his staff.\n\nDuring the finale of the film, Hermes is present to celebrate Hercules' success. He summons the [[Muses]] to sing an \"[[A Star Is Born]]\" as the film closes out as he plays the piano.\n\n===''[[Hercules (TV series)|Hercules: The Series]]''===\nIn the animated series, taking place during Hercules' training years on [[Phil's Island]], Hermes makes occasional appearances and sometimes joins Hercules on one of his misadventures. For example, in \"[[Hercules and the Bacchanal]]\", he volunteers alongside Hercules in watching over Phil's island as the satyr leaves for the weekend. In \"[[Hercules and the Romans]]\", he is given the name of Mercury by [[Icarus]].\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\nHermes made a few cameo appearances in the animated series. In \"[[Donald Wants to Fly]]\", his shoes are stolen by [[Donald Duck]] as he tries to teach himself how to fly, which goes unsuccessful.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Hermes' favorite phrase is \"Babe\".\n*Hermes' glasses seem to not just be aesthetic, he needs them to see clearly in the scene where the Titans storm Olympus.\n*Hermes design in the film is based off his voice actor, Paul Shaffer's, appearance, who also wears round glasses and plays piano.\n*In Greek mythology, Hermes was also the god of shepherds, travelers, merchants, thieves, and all others who lived by their wits. Like most of the major gods, he was a son of Zeus. Even though Hermes was the god of liars and thieves, he never stole or lied - but he often didn't tell the whole truth.\n*Hermes' Roman counterpart is named Mercury, which is also the name of a chemical element found inside thermometers, as with the innermost and smallest planet in our Solar System.<br />\n\n==Gallery==\n===Concept Art===\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\">\nHermesConceptArt MichaelSwofford.jpg|Character design by animator Michael Swofford.\nHermesMichaelSwofford2.jpg|Art by Michael Swofford.\nHermesMichaelSwofford3.jpg|Art by Michael Swofford.\nHermes GeraldScarfe.jpg|Early Hermes design by Gerald Scarfe.\nHermesIDionis.png|Concept art\nHercules char line up253.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Screenshots===\n====''[[Hercules (film)|Hercules]]''====\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nHermes disney movie.jpg\nHercules-disneyscreencaps.com-9047.jpg\nTumblr n75awqJLZh1r3jmn6o1 1280.png\nHermes2.jpg\nHermes Hercules4.png\nHermes Hercules5.png\nHermesPainPanic Hercules3.png\nHermesPainPanic Hercules4.png\nHermes Hercules7.png\nHermesZeusHera Hercules4.png\nHercules-br-disneyscreencaps.com-367.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n====''[[Hercules (TV series)|Hercules: The Series]]''====\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nHermes disney 2.jpg\nHermes disney.jpg\nHermesherc.jpg\nHermesherc3.jpg\nDisney hermes.jpg\nHercules and the Apollo Mission -Hermes.jpg\nHercules - The Apollo Mission - hermes.jpg\nTapestry of Fate01.gif\nHermesHerc&Phil.jpg\nZeus and hermes.jpg\nZeushermes.jpg\nHades&Zeus-Hercules and The Driving Test07.jpg\nHades-Hercules and The Tiff on Olympus07.jpg\nHermes without his glasses 001.PNG\nHermesZeus TheApolloMission1.png\nHermesZeus TheApolloMission2.png\nHermes PoolParty3.png\nHermesHercules TapestryOfFate4.png\nHermes ReturnOfTyphon2.png\nHermes ReturnofTyphon3.png\nHermes ReturnofTyphon4.png\nHermes ReturnofTyphon5.png\nHermes ReturnofTyphon6.png\nHermesHercules TheBacchanal3.png\nHermes TheBacchanal4.png\nHermes TheBacchanal5.png\nHermes TheBacchanal10.png\nHermes TheBacchanal7.png\nHermes TheBacchanal13.png\nHermes TheBacchanal8.png\nHermes TheBacchanal9.png\nHermesBacchus TheBacchanal6.png\nHermesBacchusAdonis TheBacchanal3.png\nHermesHercules TheBacchanal6.png\nHermesHercules TheBacchanal9.png\nHermes TheGoldenTouch2.png\nHercules and the Yearbook (27).png\nHercules and the Yearbook (4).png\nHercules and the Yearbook (28).jpg\nHercules and the Yearbook (35).png\nHercules and the Prometheus Affair (12).jpg\nHercules and the Tiff on Olympus (6).jpg\nHercules and the Tiff on Olympus (5).jpg\nHercules and the Tiff on Olympus (4).jpg\n</gallery>\n\n====''[[House of Mouse]]''====\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nHermes HouseofMouse.png|Hermes in the ''House of Mouse''\nDonald and Hermes.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"185\" captionalign=\"center\">\nHermes HerculesAnimatedStorybook1.png|In the Animated Storybook.\nHermesZeusHera Comic.png|The comic adaptation of the film.\nDVG Hermes.png\nDSA Hermes.png|In [[Disney Sorcerer's Arena]]\nDSA portrait hermes.png\nDSA Zero to Hero.jpg\nHermes_KHIII.png|Hermes in [[Kingdom Hearts III]]\n</gallery>\n\n{{Hercules}}\n{{House of Mouse}}\n{{Kingdom Hearts}}\n[[fr:Herm\u00e8s]]\n[[Category:Gods]]\n[[Category:Hercules characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Immortal]]\n[[Category:Greek Mythology]]\n[[Category:Greek characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Olympian Gods]]\n[[Category:Uncles]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Disney Sorcerer's Arena Characters]]"
