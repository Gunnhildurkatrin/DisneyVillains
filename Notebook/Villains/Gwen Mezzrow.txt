In \"Crush and Burn\", Milo becomes upset when he find out that Gwen has a crush on him. This leads Pepper Ann to suggest that she and Milo pretend to be dating in order to scare off Gwen.\n\nIn \"The Wash-Out\", Gwen gets called out of class by the nurse. Pepper Ann speculates about the reason behind this and accidentally starts a rumor that Gwen has head lice, resulting in the whole school avoiding her.\n\nIn \"[[The Finale]]\", it is established that in the series' version of [[2013]], Gwen has had a decent life and misses Milo, though she is sad to find out he is married already. She asks [[Stewart Walldinger]] and he accepts, however she is unaware of the fact that he barely remembers her.\n\n==Episode Appearances==\n*\"[[Ziterella]]\"\n*\"[[Crush and Burn]]\"\n*\"[[Soccer Season]]\"\n*\"[[A 'Tween Halloween]]\"\n*\"[[Like Riding a Bike]]\"\n*\"[[The Wash-Out]]\n*\"[[The Finale]]\"\n\n==Trivia==\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nLike Riding a Bike (1).jpg\nGwenMezzrow-114.png\nGwenMezzrow-113.png\nGreenSleeves.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Pepper Ann}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mezzrow, Gwen}}\n[[Category:Pepper Ann characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]"
