Donald's good side persuades Donald to go to school while his bad side tempts him to go fishing. After witnessing the bad side pull a prank on Donald, Angel Donald gets into a fight with the devil and pulverizes him. Donald thanks the frustrated angel for helping, pleasing Angel Donald to accompany Donald to school, although not without booting Donald back on the path after the duck walks past the schoolhouse.\n\n===''[[Donald's Decision]]''===\nIn this wartime retread of the latter, the Angel encourages Donald to help the war effort by making a loan to the US government while the Devil encourages Donald to be stingy and that war bonds are a scam. Like in the last cartoon, Angel Donald wins over Devil Donald.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\n1938-ange-2.jpg\nTumblr n5r938wZw01qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\nBETTER SELF.png\nTumblr mxemvoGrnG1qhcrb0o4 1280.jpg|Appearing on [[Weebo]]'s monitor in ''[[Flubber]]''\nDonald's Devil and Angel.jpg\nDonald's Decision.jpg\n</gallery>\n{{Mickey Mouse & Friends}}\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Angels]]\n[[Category:Mentors]]\n[[Category:Alternate Forms]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Males|Angel Donald]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
