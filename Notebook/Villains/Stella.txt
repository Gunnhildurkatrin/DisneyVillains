She is [[Charlotte La Bouff|Charlotte]]'s pet bloodhound given to her by her father [[Eli La Bouff]].\n\n==Role in the film==\nStella is an energetic bloodhound who is first seen at the beginning of the film, given to Charlotte as a puppy from her father, Eli \"Big Daddy\" La Bouff. She's later seen at the La Bouff masquerade ball in a Roman Centurion costume, begging for one of [[Tiana|Tiana's]] beignets. Tiana relents, but gives only one to Stella. When Tiana accidentally knocked into the table and ruined her outfit, Stella is seen eating the rest of the beignets that remain on the ground.\n\nLater, after Tiana and [[Prince Naveen|Naveen]] are transformed into frogs by a curse of the evil [[Dr. Facilier]], they accidentally crash into the party and into Charlotte's dress. Big Daddy orders Stella to get the two frogs, resulting in a chase through the masquerade ball and across a dining table, leading to a huge net where she crashes into a couple wearing a pirate costume and a mermaid costume causing her to collect pieces of their costumes.\n\nAs Tiana and Naveen leave with a few balloons, Tiana calls out to Stella who she is to calm herself as she is shocked and calls out Tiana's name in question, much to Tiana's shock. This was when Tiana began to realize that she had gained the ability to talk to animals upon being transformed into a frog.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*At the beginning of the movie, Charlotte refers to Stella as a 'he'. It's presumed she was corrected off-screen.\n*Stella is probably named after the character Stella from ''A Streetcar Named Desire'', something supported by the fact that Big Daddy calls for her by shouting, \"Hey, STELLA!!!\" like Stanley Kowalski does. Interestingly enough, [[John Goodman]] played the ''Steetcar'' character Harold Mitchell in the 1995 TV Version.\n\n{{The Princess and the Frog}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:The Princess and the Frog characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
