He is the world's greatest ''human'' detective (Basil being the world's greatest ''mouse'' detective). While Basil, [[David Q. Dawson|Dawson]], and [[Olivia Flaversham]] look for Toby, they observe Holmes with Watson (depicted as silhouettes against the wall). The two depart the scene to continue their own investigations, allowing Basil and the company to \"borrow\" Toby in the meantime.\n\n== Disney Parks ==\n=== [[Mr. Toad's Wild Ride]] ===\nSherlock makes a cameo in the [[Disneyland]] version of this attraction, his distinctive silhouette being seen from a second-floor window in the town.  The reasoning behind this is likely in reference to [[the Wind in the Willows]]' narrator Basil Rathbone who famously portrayed the detective.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Sherlock Holmes' voice in ''The Great Mouse Detective'' is taken from clips of the original ''Sherlock Holmes'' films.\n*Sherlock has been references, homaged and parodied in a number of Disney products.\n**Basil of Baker Street was created as the Great Mouse Detective's analogue to Sherlock.\n**In the ''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]'' episode \"[[Pound of the Baskervilles]]\", a parody of Sherlock Holmes named Sureluck Jones was created and was the main character hero of the novels [[Chip and Dale|Chip]] read and admired.\n**In the ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'' episode \"[[Elementary My Dear Stacy]]\", [[Candace]] and [[Stacy]] read the entire collection\u00a0of the Sherlock Holmes books and decides to use Holmes' method of deduction with Stacy's help to bust [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]] and [[Ferb Fletcher|Ferb]]'s activity.\n**A [[Wax figures|wax figure]] Sherlock voiced by [[John Oliver]] appeared as a villain in the episode [[Headhunters]] of [[Gravity Falls|Gravity Falls.]]\n*In the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_(TV_series) British TV Series of the same name], he was played\u00a0by [[Benedict Cumberbatch]], and in the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes_(2009_film) Guy Ritchie] [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes:_A_Game_of_Shadows movies], he\u00a0is played by [[Robert Downey Jr.]]\u00a0Both of them played characters in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]: Cumberbatch played [[Doctor Strange]] and [[Dormammu]], and Downey Jr. played [[Iron Man]].\n\n{{The Great Mouse Detective}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Holmes, Sherlock}}\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:The Great Mouse Detective characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Detectives]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:English characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Unseen characters]]\n[[Category:Martial Artists]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
