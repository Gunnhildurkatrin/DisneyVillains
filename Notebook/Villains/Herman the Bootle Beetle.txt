"{{Infobox character\n|image = 1961-chasse-5.jpg\n|name = Herman the Bootle Beetle\n|voice = [[Paul Frees]]}}'''Herman the Bootle Beetle''' is the assistant of Professor [[Ludwig Von Drake]]. He appears in with the professor in several episodes of [[Walt Disney anthology series|''Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color'']], including \"[[The Hunting Instinct]]'''\"''', \"[[Three Tall Tales]]\", \"[[Music for Everybody]]\" and \"[[The Truth About Mother Goose (Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color episode)|The Truth About Mother Goose]]\". Herman is also alluded to in a ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs]]'' promo seen at the end of the original version of \"[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: I Love to Laugh!]]\".\n\nGiven that the only voice credit in his appearances with Von Drake is [[Paul Frees]], it can be assumed that Frees voiced Herman as well.\n==Background==\nIn ''The Truth About Mother Goose'', it is established that Herman and the professor have been friends since childhood. He is shown to be a firm believer in fairy tales, which annoys Von Drake. He also frequently says things that annoy the professor, but despite it all, Von Drake cares for his well-being.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery orientation=\"none\" position=\"center\">\n1963-goose-02.jpg\n1961-donald-dingue-13.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Insects]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
