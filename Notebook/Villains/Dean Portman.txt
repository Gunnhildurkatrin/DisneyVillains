He is an enforcer and wears number 21. Dean first appears in ''[[D2: The Mighty Ducks]]'' as part of the [[Team USA (Junior Goodwill Games)]] team. He is the team's heavy enforcer that gives the Ducks a physical presence on the ice. He is close friends with fellow enforcer [[Fulton Reed]] and one half of the \"Bash Brothers.\" Like Fulton, he dons a bandanna around his forehead, which is worn under his hockey helmet and shares a love for metal music with the other Bash Brother. He is present in the beginning of ''[[D3: The Mighty Ducks]]'' to accept the scholarships from Eden Hall but chooses to not attend Eden Hall. (This news is relayed to Charlie by Fulton who suggests that Portman may have decided to not accept the scholarship because Coach Bombay would not be in charge any more.) Portman does return for the JV-Varsity showdown in the last 15 minutes of the film [[D3: The Mighty Ducks]] and brings much needed spirit to the Ducks. He is put in the penalty box for 2 minutes after bringing down one of the varsity players in a dive and retaliates by stripping in the penalty box. Portman tends to be rough around the edges, especially when he is first introduced in [[D2: The Mighty Ducks|D2]]. Later, he is shown to be laid-back when out having fun and enjoys flirting with attractive women. He is portrayed by Aaron Lohr.\n\n== Playing Style ==\nUnlike his ''Bash Brother'' partner, Fulton Reed, Dean is more of an enforcer than an offensive player. He will play offense if needed to but is primarily used as a physical presence on the ice. His playing style and his attitude sometimes works against him, as he was thrown out of the Ducks first game with Iceland in the second film, and was placed in the penalty box in the third film against Varsity.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* It is unknown what happened to Portman after D3. Fulton Reed's actor Elden Henson is set to appear in episode 6 of [[The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers]]. So it's possible it could be revealed what happened to Portman.\n\n==Quotes==\n*\"Yeah, it's showtime!\" (first introduced to Bombay in ''D2''.)\n*\"Dean Portman is awarded a full athletic and academic scholarship to the Eden Hall Academy. I had this lying around my house in Chicago, my attorney suggested I sign it and I agreed. It's official, boys, I'm back!\" (Portman announcing his triumphant return in ''D3''.)\n*\"Ref, gimme a break, man! That was a dive!\" (Arguing with the referees when put in the penalty box for 2 minutes in ''D3''.)\n{{The Mighty Ducks}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Portman, Dean}}\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:The Mighty Ducks characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:American characters]]"
