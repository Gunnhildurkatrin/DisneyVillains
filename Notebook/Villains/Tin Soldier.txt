Kind, good-natured, gentlemanly, courageous and dutiful, he takes his job as peacekeeper of the playroom seriously and joins his \"brothers\", the other tin soldiers, on their patrol every night. Despite the fact that he has only one leg, he does not let that stop him from getting around, pushing through and overcoming obstacles with great inner strength and endurance. When he spies the Ballerina, he is ecstatic and drawn to her, but once she reveals to have two legs instead of one, he feels crushed. However, his goodness draws her to him, proving that his disability is not what defines him. Like a fairy tale knight, he willingly throws himself into battle against the Jack-in-the-Box to protect his beloved, eventually triumphing.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Fantasia 2000]]''===\nAfter being brought to a boy's house, he notices a [[Ballerina]] nearby and is briefly led to believe that she has one leg like him. However, she lets down her second leg from under her dress, disappointing him. Despite this, she notices him and they quickly fall in love. However, a jealous [[Jack-in-the-Box (Fantasia 2000)|Jack-in-the-Box]] eyes the beautiful dancer and wants her for himself. After trapping the ballerina in a goblet, the Jack-In-The-Box casts the Tin Soldier out of the house with a wooden boat. The soldier rolls into the sewers, using the boat to stay afloat. After evading an army of rats, he falls into a lake and is gobbled by a trout. Fishermen reel up the trout soon after and find the soldier in its mouth. They decide to return it to its owner, and the Tin Soldier soon re-engages the evil Jack-in-the-Box. The Jack-in-the-Box assaults the soldier with a sword, but the Tin Soldier dodges the attack and outmaneuvers him into a fireplace. The villain quickly burns to ashes and the Tin Soldier and the Ballerina happily reunite.\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\nThe Tin Soldier makes a cameo in the episode \"[[Goofy's Valentine Date]]\" alongside the Ballerina.\n\n==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==\n===[[Walt Disney World]]===\nThe Steadfast Tin Soldier appears in statue form with the Ballerina and Jack-in-the-Box at the ''Fantasia'' section of [[Disney's All-Star Movies Resort]].\n\n==Trivia==\n*Like in the original [[Hans Christian Andersen]] story, the Tin Soldier and Ballerina were intended to die together in the fire, but the ending changed when it became apparent that the ending would conflict with the music choice for the segment.\n*In the original fairy tale, the Soldier rides down the storm drains on a paper boat. In the Disney version, he gets trapped on a wood boat.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"180\" position=\"center\">\nFan2.png |Ballerina smelling the pink rose when Tin Soldier is looking at her, confused.\nsoldier_HoM.png|The Tin Soldier with the Ballerina in ''House of Mouse''\nTin Soldier.jpg\nTin Solider and Ballerina Pin.jpg|Tin Soldier and Ballerina Pin\nTin Soldier and Ballerina Staring at Each Other.jpg |Tin Soldier and Ballerina looking at each other, confused.\nFantasia 2000 - Tin Soldier and Ballerina Concept Art.jpg|Visual Development & Character Design of the Ballerina and Tin Soldier is from a piece of concept art.\n</gallery><br />{{Fantasia}}\n[[Category:Fantasia characters]]\n[[Category:Toys]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Soldiers]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Characters with disabilities]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
