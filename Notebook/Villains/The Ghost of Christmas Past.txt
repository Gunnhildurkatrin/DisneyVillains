In this version, the ghost has a light Irish accent. He takes Scrooge on a journey throughout his past in order to show Scrooge how he became the miserly moneylender he is. During this journey, Scrooge discovered the following things:\n*His father neglected him as a child.\n*His kind sister [[Fan]] brought him back home from boarding school only to die giving birth to [[Fred (A Christmas Carol)|Fred]].\n*[[Fezziwig]] was a kind Christmas loving boss to him.\n*Scrooge started a successful business in money-lending and finances.\n*He first met [[Belle (A Christmas Carol)|Belle]] during Fezziwig's Christmas party.\n*He then broke up with Belle by the time Scrooge started his obsession with finances.\n\nAfter which, Scrooge wants to leave but the ghost uses\u00a0then his face to show all the people the old man knew in his kindness. Scared, Scrooge quickly extinguishes the ghost with his own extinguisher. However, Scrooge is then shot up into the sky, toward the moon, and falls about 50,000 feet toward the ground back to his house.\n\n==Appearances in Disney media==\n===''The Muppet Christmas Carol''===\nIn the Muppet adaptation, the ghost is a female voiced by Jessica Fox and puppeteered by [[Karen Prell]]. The Ghost shows Scrooge his lonely childhood at school, a happy Christmas party at Fozziwig's, and his breakup with his fiancee, [[Belle (The Muppet Christmas Carol)|Belle]].\n\n===''DuckTales'' (2017)===\nA version of the Ghost of Christmas Past appears in the 2017 reboot of [[DuckTales (2017 series)|''DuckTales'']] in the episode \"[[Last Christmas!]]\". This version is depicted as a cricket (in a nod to Jiminy Cricket portraying him) and carries an umbrella that appears to be the source of his time traveling powers.\n\nHe, along with the Ghosts of Christmas Present and Future visit [[Scrooge McDuck]] every year just to hang out after accidentally visiting him instead of Ebenezer Scrooge. The group take Scrooge to his first Christmas party held at McDuck Manor, but when he gets irritated with the events unfolding, Past takes him further back to before McDuck Manor was even built, revealing that he wants to keep Scrooge to himself due to constantly being left behind and forgotten by every person he has to help every Christmas. Scrooge manages to trick Past into giving him his umbrella to return to his time, leaving him in the cold barren land.\n\nDue to longing to be reunited with Scrooge, Past transforms into a Wendigo and begins stalking the surrounding area until he encounters a young [[Donald Duck|Donald]], [[Della Duck]], and a time-traveling [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|Dewey Duck]]. The trio captures him before Scrooge arrives to bring Dewey back to his time period. Seeing the two happily reunite moves Past and he transforms back to normal with Scrooge giving him his umbrella back. Past is seen with the other Ghosts attending Scrooge's Christmas party with his friends and family.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"200\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nChristmasCarol.jpg\nGhost of Christmas Past.png\nCarol-disneyscreencaps com-3531.jpg\nCarol-disneyscreencaps com-5074.jpg\nA Christmas Carol.jpg|Ghost of Christmas Past on the poster of A Christmas Carol as a candle.\nPast.jpg|The Ghost of Christmas Past in ''[[The Muppet Christmas Carol]]''\nCadpig_as_the_Ghost_of_Christmas_Past.jpg|[[Cadpig]] as the Ghost of Christmas Past in \"A Christmas Cruella\".\nJiminyCricket2.jpg|Jiminy Cricket as the Ghost of Christmas Past in ''Mickey's Christmas Carol''.\nDuckTales Ghost of Christmas Past.jpeg|The Ghost of Christmas Past in the [[DuckTales (2017 series)]]\n</gallery>\n==See also==\n*[[Jiminy Cricket]] - Portrayed the role in ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]''.\n*[[Cadpig]] - Portrayed the role in the ''[[101 Dalmatians: The Series]]'' episode, \"[[A Christmas Cruella]]\"\n*[[Tigger]] - Portrayed the role in ''[[Winnie the Pooh: Springtime with Roo]]''.\n\n{{A Christmas Carol}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ghost of Christmas Past, The}}\n[[Category:A Christmas Carol characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Dickensian characters]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Holiday Figures]]\n[[Category:The Muppet Christmas Carol characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Spirits]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:DuckTales characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Grasshoppers and crickets]]\n[[Category:English characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Time travelers]]"
