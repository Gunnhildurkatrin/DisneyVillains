'''Experiment 285''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]]. He is designed to\u00a0halt the productivity of entire work forces, companies, and any civilians\u00a0by turning them lackadaisical with a zap from his antenna, causing civilizations to fail and making it easier\u00a0to invade their planet, and it even works on technology.\u00a0His one true place is at the [[Kauai Airport|local airport]], making grouchy tourists enjoy their vacation.\n\n==Background==\n===Physical appearance===\nLax is a purple parrot-like experiment with black eyes, a single green-tipped, [https://www.britannica.com/science/esca esca]-like antenna, a blue-striped beak, and green-striped tail feathers.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nLax can emit a green laser\u00a0from his antenna that contains a chemical that relieves the sympathetic nervous system and causes the brain to deny stress, and therefore makes the victim feel \"on vacation\"; if the laser\u00a0hits a machine, the chemical has a similar effect and causes all complex functions or artificial intelligence to shut off, creating the \"vacation\" effect. Thus, a person hit with Lax's ray will relax, and a machine hit with said ray will shut down.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment 285 was the 285th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to fire a green laser\u00a0from his antenna that causes enemies, innocent civilians, and even modern technology to abandon work. 285 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai, with 285's pod landing in some bushes\u00a0near the [[Lilo's House|Pelekais' house]].\n\nThe [[Recess|Recess Gang]], along with their chaperone [[Muriel Finster|Miss Finster]], accompany [[Gretchen Grundler|Gretchen]] to [[Hawaii]] after she makes a big discovery about a new planet.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Stitch]], a local and her alien friend, have made a mess trying to create a new recipe. Lilo's older sister, [[Nani Pelekai|Nani]], orders them to clean it up\u00a0and then leaves for work (however, while driving over\u00a0a puddle, Experiment 285's pod\u00a0was activated). Instead, they try to make [[Pleakley]], another alien with a love of cleaning, do it. However, after seeing how huge the mess is, Pleakley faints.\n\nSometime after, Stitch wanders outside and does nothing except lie in a hammock. Then Pleakley is zapped by the same unknown energy that got Stitch, causing him to laze about in a similar fashion. The same goes for another alien named [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], who just arrived.\n\nIt turns out the culprit is Experiment 285, or Lax, an alien experiment with an antenna-like appendage that is designed to cause people to be very relaxed and lazy. Lilo and a lazy Stitch chase after him, but instead find [[Ashley Spinelli|Spinelli]] running towards the pool of the [[Birds of Paradise Hotel|hotel]], followed closely by the rest of the Recess Gang. Lilo follows as well, but then [[Mikey Blumberg|Mikey]] and [[Vince LaSalle|Vince]] (though at separate times) are zapped by Lax. Lilo explains everything to [[TJ Detweiler|T.J.]], and they then try to capture Lax, but they fail and he escapes.\n\nMeanwhile, another alien named [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] is made to follow a satellite's directions to find Lax for the evil [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]. Lilo and four of the Recess characters, [[Gus Griswald|Gus]], T.J., Gretchen, and Spinelli, catch up to Lax at an observatory. T.J. and Spinelli try to get Lax themselves, but they too get zapped. Just then, Gretchen finds the new \"planet\" that she discovers, but Lilo finds out it's only a satellite being used by H\u00e4msterviel (the same one Gantu uses).\n\nGretchen's Galileo computer is zapped; however, Gretchen gets the idea to use the telescope to zap the satellite. While most of the Recess Gang distract Lax by hitting golf balls at him, Gretchen is zapped, but she still works on the plan; apparently, she finds work relaxing. Gus gets chased by Lax, but Lilo distracts Lax just in time for Stitch to pummel him. Lilo, Gretchen, and Gus then put their plan into action, and the satellite ends up destroyed. Gantu confronts them, but Lax zaps him, thus ending the threat.\n\nThe Recess Gang eventually goes back to normal, and Lax finds a hobby in zapping stressed and unpleasant tourists at the [[Kauai Airport|airport]]. Then Spinelli wonders where Finster is. It turns out Finster has never left the spa.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nThe first 624 experiments, including Lax, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium\u00a0to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]], and [[Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nLax participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]].\n\nThe Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Lilo and Gus are the only main characters to not get zapped by Lax.\n*There are a few moments between T.J. and Spinelli, like when he asked her to help him out with distracting the experiment Lax. Also, when the six kids plus Lilo and Stitch were all at the observatory, right before the two of them both get zapped by Lax, Spinelli is seen quickly taking T.J. by the hand and then running up together to the rooftop of the building. After that, they are both seen goofing off together on the beach, while under Lax's spell.\n*Lax's\u00a0[[Experiment Pods|pod]] color is green.\n*The [[Experiment Pod Container]] describes Lax as: \"Experiment 285. Primary function: Causes enemies to abandon work.\"\n*Lax is one of the few experiments to not appear in the group photo at the end of ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''.\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n{{Recess}}\n[[Category:Recess characters]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
