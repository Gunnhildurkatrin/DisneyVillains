She is Princess Isabel's favorite scientist.\n\n==Role in the Series==\nProfessor Ochoa makes her debut appearance in \"[[Science Unfair]]\".\n\nShe first appears at the Avalor Science Fair as the judge. There she meets Princess Isabel. Isabel shows Ochoa her project: The exergroomer. Professor Ochoa is so impressed that she not only declares Isabel the winner but also invites her to take one class with her at the Academy every week as well, which Isabel happily accepts.\n\nShe makes her second appearance in \"[[Class Act]]\". When she greets Elena and Isabel when they arrive at the Avalor Science Academy, Isabel hugs her due to being happy to see her again. After giving Isabel a lab coat, Professor Ochoa gives the Princess a tour of the Academy. She then leads them to her class, where she finds Javier sitting at her desk. After returning him to his seat, Professor Ochoa pairs Isabel with Tomiko and leads everyone outside where she has her students do an egg dropping experiment. When Isabel's egg breaks, Professor Ochoa tells her she must do better. Later, she is impressed with Isabel's ideas and machine. She is saddened when Isabel leaves after the machine goes haywire and breaks. When Elena brings her back, Professor Ochoa tells her that the only way she'll let her down is if she decides to quit. Isabel builds a machine that she is immediately impressed by and picks for the Observatory project. This makes Javier throw a tantrum that causes a clamp to pop out from under one of his books. Isabel recognizes the clamp as the one from her first machine. When this makes Elena and Tomiko deduce and reveal that Javier stole it and that that's why Isabel's first machine broke, Professor Ochoa deduces that Javier deliberately sabotaged Isabel and firmly suspends him. When he protests this, Professor Ochoa merely tells him to get out by pointing to the door. After he leaves, she resumes teaching her class.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nClass Act (6).png\nClass Act (14).png\nClass Act (23).png\nClass Act (25).png\nClass Act (26).png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Elena of Avalor}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ochoa, Professor}}\n[[Category:Elena of Avalor characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Teachers]]\n[[Category:Professors]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
