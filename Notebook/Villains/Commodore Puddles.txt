Despite being his pet, Commodore Puddles only appears twice throughout Kim Possible.\n\n\n==Background==\nIn his first appearance in the season one episode [[Kimitation Nation]], Commodore Puddles made a very brief cameo while being locked in a very large cage. Dr. Drakken reveals the different types of DNA used to create clones capable of being a threat to Kim Possible, with Commodore Puddles being revealed last and the most vicious of animals he used. In this episode, Commodore Puddles is colored gray.<br>\nIn his second and last appearance in the season two episode [[Rufus vs. Commodore Puddles]], he has a more significant role compared to his previous appearance. He was revealed to have been adopted by Dr. Drakken fairly recently and was shown to be pestering Drakken during the middle of discussing his plot to Shego. Shego pointed out that Commodore Puddles needed to be let out, but Drakken was too preoccupied to let him out, to which Shego reminded Drakken that if he wanted to have a pet, he'd need to be responsible of taking care of one. After losing his patience, Commodore Puddles relieved himself on Drakken's shrink ray, which caused it to spark. Once a fight ensued between [[Team Possible]] and the villains, Rufus was shoved onto Commodore Puddles and both were shoved underneath the shrink ray. Once the shrink ray was activated, instead of shrinking the small poodle, he grew to about three stories tall.<br>\nWith an enlarged Commodore Puddles, Drakken revises his plan to infiltrate Area 51 from shrinking himself and sneaking in to riding on Commodore Puddles and using his poodle to dig into the Area's underground facility and steal the alien technology. The plan would have succeeded had it not been for Rufus, who went back to Drakken's lair he rented and used the \"shrink\" ray to enlarge himself to fight the enlarged poodle. After the fight, he was locked in a giant pet carrier alongside Shego (after her usual defeat to Kim Possible) while Drakken escaped in a UFO.\n===Personality===\nCommodore Puddle's personality is in of itself an enigma, as he is extremely vicious for a small poodle. As shown in ''Kimitation Nation'' (via the use of using his DNA in a cloned-[[Bonnie Rockwaller]]), he seems to harbor a strong hatred toward Kim Possible, mirroring his owner's hatred toward the teen hero. In his second appearance, Commodore Puddles seems to also mirror typical dog behavior, especially when he needed to go out, which included a small amount of tricks learn (such as rolling over).\nInterestingly, in his second appearance, he was far less violent and more docile when not engaged in combat against Team Possible.\n===Physical appearance===\nCommodore Puddles is a small poodle whose appearance changes between the two episodes he appeared in. In ''Kimitation Nation'', he appeared to have white hair and gray skin, while in ''Rufus vs. Commodore Puddles'', he appeared to have pink hair and pink skin.\n===Powers and abilities===\nCommodore Puddles is a normal poodle (with the exception of his unusual vicious behavior); however, once he grew from Drakken's malfunctioning shrink ray, his normal dog-like traits became powerful enough to cause some major damage to his surroundings, such as when he attempted to dig into Area 51's underground facility and the facility started to drip dirt from the giant poodle's digging.\n==Appearances==\n===Kim Possible===\nCommodore Puddles only appeared in two episodes throughout the series: [[Kimitation Nation]] and [[Rufus vs. Commodore Puddles]].\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nCommodore_Puddles_first_appearance.gif|Commodore Puddle's first appearance with white hair and gray skin in Kimitation Nation\nCommodore_Puddles_being_enlarged.jpg|Commodore Puddles being zapped by the malfunctioning shrink ray and growing in size\nPuddle_and_Rufus.png|The fight between Rufus and Commodore Puddles\n</gallery>\n==Trivia==\n*With Commodore Puddles' striking and stark difference in his physical appearance, it is possible that his skin and hair had been dyed, as it is common for poodle owners to do to their poodles.\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n\n{{Kim Possible}}\n\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Kim Possible characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]"
