'''Chaz Anthony''', is the main protagonist of the [[1999]], Disney channel film, ''[[Genius]]''.\u00a0He has some personal problems in that the kids of the town where he grew up in reject him for being a genius, and when he qualifies to work at a university as an intern, the college students there poke fun at him for being a minor. This leads Charlie to believe that he should act more like a stereotypical \"bad boy\" in order to avoid drawing attention to himself. However, when he meets an attractive local girl named Claire, he may learn the best thing is to be himself.\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Boyle, Charlie}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:Inventors]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
