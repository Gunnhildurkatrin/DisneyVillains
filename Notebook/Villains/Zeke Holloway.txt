Oh. But the story of Ezekiel Holloway...that I have not dared tell before now.|Zeke Holloway, during the game's introduction}}\n\n'''Ezekiel \"Zeke\" Holloway''' is the protagonist of the [[The Haunted Mansion (video game)|video game adaptation]] of ''[[The Haunted Mansion]]''.\n\n==Role in the game==\nAccording to the storyline, Zeke was originally an orphan and grew up in [[Louisiana]]. He applies to become the caretaker of the mansion. Zeke needed to work in the mansion in order to help his finances in becoming a writer. With the help of [[Madame Leota]], Zeke is given a magical lantern known as the [[Beacon of Souls]], which is a magical weapon to be used against the unruly spirits of the mansion. Despite being a coward, he helps save the mansion from [[Atticus Thorn]]'s conquest of the afterlife.\n\nZeke goes around the mansion, overcoming the dark barriers and twisted spells Thorn has erected around each of the rooms. Along the way, he reacquires each of the missing [[Soul Gems]] to restore the Beacon's powers and captures Shriveled Souls hidden in each area. Finally, after acquiring the [[Seaman's Ring]] from one of the friendly ghosts, Zeke unlocks a hidden chamber in the foyer.\n\nZeke finally encounters Atticus Thorn in the Vault of Shadows. After a lengthy and grueling battle with the Order of Shadows' Grandmaster, Zeke triumphs, freeing the trapped souls in the mansion at last. He later stays on as caretaker of the estate before finally pursuing his career as a writer.\n\n==Trivia==\n*He seems to be a younger version of the [[Caretaker]] from [[The Haunted Mansion (Disneyland)|the Haunted Mansion]] attraction.\n*He could be named after the late [[Sterling Holloway]].\n*He bears a striking resemblance to [[Ichabod Crane]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nZeke about to faint.png|Zeke about to faint.\nZeke meets Leota.png|Zeke meets Madame Leota.\nZeke Soul Gem.png|Zeke acquires the first Soul Gem.\nZeke grandfather clock.png|Zeke saving the game at a grandfather clock\nDoc Penezek.png|Zeke meets up with Doc Penezek, one of the resident ghosts.\nZeke and Shadow Tome.png|Zeke examines one of the Shadow Tomes.\nZeke and singing bust.png|Zeke with one of the singing busts.\nZeke Holloway giant gargoyle fight.png|Zeke facing a gargoyle in the mausoleum.\nZeke against Dark Reaper.png|Zeke faces a dark reaper.\nSpace Debris Haunted Mansion.png|Zeke finds himself among debris in space.\nAtticus Thorn Worm.png|Zeke facing off against Thorn.\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Haunted Mansion}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Holloway, Zeke}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in video games]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:The Haunted Mansion characters]]\n[[Category:Authors]]\n[[Category:Orphans]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
