He was planned to have appeared as part of the party that welcomed [[Alice Kingsleigh]] back to [[Underland]]. He only speaks a few times and only says \u2018''Eggsactually''\u2019 but it\u2019s unknown if that is the way he speaks or if he intentionally speaks in puns. He is instructed to get the [[Oraculum]] by [[Mallymkun]] who always calls him a good duck. When the [[Bandersnatch]] attacks, he tries to waddle away with the Oraculum but is snatched up by [[The Knave of Hearts|Ilosovic Stayne]]. In [[The Red Queen's Castle|Salazen Grum]], Omaque, as well as several ducks, is forced to be a waiter. His and the others beak\u2019s are bound tightly and used as serving platers for drinks and tidbits. Eventually, he is escapes with all the other prisoners and participates in the battle at the Chessboard where he and [[Thackery Earwicket]] fight against a saber-toothed badger. After the battle is won, Omaque says his farewells to Alice. Since he was deleted, that was his last ever planned appearance.\n\n==Trivia==\n* It is possible that Omaque replaces the [[Tall Flowers]] since they don't appear in the script draft he was in.\n* There is no platypus in either of the books, so it is quite likely that he is an original character\n\n{{Alice in Wonderland}}\n[[Category:Platypuses]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Servants]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Deleted characters]]"
