Each one wears a black bowtie \n\n===Personality===\nThree of them are cheerful, but their leader appears cynical.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''Mary Poppins''===\nThey are seen in the animated sequence when [[Mary Poppins (character)|Mary Poppins]] and Bert, specifically during the part where the song \"[[Jolly Holiday]]\" pauses for a bit and then resumes. They serve them and enjoy a dance with Bert. Later, he offers Mary to dance with them just as they join him and Bert. They are not seen again for the rest of the film afterward.\n\n===''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''===\nThey serve people at the [[Ink and Paint Club]] in this film. [[Eddie Valiant]] orders a scotch on the rocks from one and adds, \"And I mean ice!\" The penguin returns with his drink with a diamond in it (\"ice\" is a slang term for \"diamond\"), upon which he replies, \"Toons.\" Two of them appear at the end of the film alongside the other cartoon characters.\n\n===''[[The Little Mermaid (TV series)|The Little Mermaid]]''===\nA different group of penguins wearing the same bowties from ''Mary Poppins'' makes an appearance in the episode ''[[Save the Whale]]''. They are a group of performing penguins that perform in Pettigrew's Penguin Park. When they feel like they want to escape it just like [[Spot]], [[Ariel]], [[Flounder]], and [[Sebastian]], they manage to do so along with Spot.\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\nThey serve as waiters for the ''House of Mouse''.\n\n===''[[Saving Mr. Banks]]''===\nIn this film, they remain a point of contention between P.L. Travers and [[Walt Disney (Saving Mr. Banks character)|Walt Disney]], as Travers is adamant about refusing to have them in ''Mary Poppins'' since it feels they would dumb down her books. When Travers cries at the premiere, is it ambiguous whether she's sad about them being left in ''Mary Poppins'' (as she claimed both in this film and in real life) or about how ''Mary Poppins'' reminds her of the tragic relationship with her father.\n\n===''[[Mary Poppins Returns]]''===\nIn the sequel, they make a reappearance still in an animated sequence at the Royal Doulton Bowl where all the inhabitants are anthropomorphic animals. They dance along with Mary and a cast of animals during the song \"[[A Cover is Not the Book]]\". They look somewhat different from their original versions as they are heavily redesigned with larger eyes, more distinct appearances from one another, and a more elaborate costume (their bowties being supplemented by hats and evening wear) \u2014 casting doubt on whether they are the same ones as their original version, although they certainly appear to know Mary. \n\n===[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]===\nThey are semi-rare characters. They only make occasional meet and greet appearances and are often seen with Mary. They are also seen in [[Fantasmic!]] on certain nights and featured in [[One Man's Dream II: The Magic Lives On!]].\n\n===Disney Games===\nThey make a possible role in ''[[102 Dalmatians: Puppies to the Rescue]]'', as one of the toys that [[Cruella De Vil|Cruella]]'s factory makes. They try to attack either [[Domino]] or [[Oddball]] by sliding toward them.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Their theme is a kazoo played by [[Richard Sherman]], one of the film's songwriters.\n*They resemble {{WikipediaLink|chinstrap penguin}}s.\n*They were going to be four human waiters until [[Walt Disney]] said that waiters reminded him of penguins.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\npenguins copy.jpg\njh01.jpg|The penguins set Bert and Mary.\nmpdance.jpg|Bert and the penguins dance.\nimgmp4.jpg|Penguins sculpture\n4107623287 feedc32dc4.jpg|A penguin at a Disney park\npenguin of mary poppins by chaaaarxd-d33j2bi.jpg|Another penguin at a Disney park\nDisney 2008 0218.JPG|Penguins at the Disney Stars and Motor Cars Parade\nHumphrey and penguin waiter.jpg\nc07f9eab-3a05-45c3-990d-8e7c19ca9691.jpg\nMax and penguins dressing up beast.jpg\n2001-tousenboiteS2-P1.jpg\n2001-tousenboiteS2-P2.jpg\npenguin waiters house of mouse.jpg\nPenguinWaitersinDisneylandFun.jpg|Penguins in ''[[Disneyland Fun]]''\nWaiterPenguinsinBeachPartyatWaltDisneyWorld.jpg|Penguins in ''[[Beach Party at Walt Disney World]]''\nmary-poppins-disneyscreencaps.com-5820.jpg\nmary-poppins-disneyscreencaps.com-5823.jpg\nmary-poppins-disneyscreencaps.com-5825.jpg\nI'mWalkingRightDowntheMiddleofMainStreetU.S.A..jpg\n4pengsCapSm.jpg\nTumblr n3u5thJqEq1rxt9glo6 1280.jpg\nHouse Of Mouse relief.jpg\nHouse Of Mouse - (Ep. 38) - Humphrey In The House12.jpg\nB69uHcbCUAI61Pe.jpg large.jpeg\nOnemansdream36.jpg\nOnemansdream35.jpg\nTumblr n4wrd4vDh61rxt9glo5 1280.jpg\nWho-framed-roger-rabbit-disneyscreencaps.com-1719.jpg|Their appearance in ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit''\nsavethewhale114.jpg|A bunch of penguins who look like them in \"[[Save the Whale]]\"\nFantasia-disneyscreencaps com-6575.jpg\nPenguin Waiter Tsum Tsum Mini.jpg\nMary Poppins Returns (27).png|A penguin in ''Mary Poppins Returns''\nMary Poppins Returns (74.png\nMary Poppins Returns (52).jpg\nMary Poppins Returns (53).jpg\naug72.gif|Penguin Waiters stock art\naug71.gif\nDisney_characters_portrait_1.jpg\nSTYLIN PENGUIN.png|As the \"Stylin\u2019 Penguin\" in [[Disney Heroes: Battle Mode]]\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Mary Poppins}}\n{{DisneyTsumTsum}}\n\n[[ar:\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0637\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0627\u0631\u0633\u0648\u0646\u0627\u062a]]\n[[Category:Animated characters in live-action films]]\n[[Category:Who Framed Roger Rabbit cameos]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Mary Poppins characters]]\n[[Category:Penguins]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Fantasmic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Dancers]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse (TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
