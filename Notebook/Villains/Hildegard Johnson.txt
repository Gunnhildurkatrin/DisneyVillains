The Johnson family greatly respects her, as the Johnson Family Picnic is held on her birthday every year.\n\n==Personality==\nIt is shown that Hildegard hates losing. She initially disliked [[Candace Flynn|Candace]]. She then changed her mind about her when she returned Annabelle Johnson to the family.\n\n==History==\nHildegard was part of the rollerskating derby early in her adult life. Her team, the Saskatoon Slashers, won against the Tri-State Bombers. Ever since then, [[Betty Jo Flynn|Betty Jo]] and Hildegard have been enemies. After a re-match in Phineas and Ferb's roller rink, the race ends in a tie. They still disagree about who won the race (\"[[Crack That Whip]]\").\n\nDuring the Johnson's Family Picnic, Hildegard had her 85th birthday. She says that she doesn't like Candace, but she changes her mind when [[Candace]] brings to the picnic Annabelle, the long lost member of the family. She recognizes Annabelle's status as a member of the family due to Anabelle's birthmark which is the letter \"J\" (\"[[Run, Candace, Run]]\").\n\n==Relationships==\n===Family===\n====[[Suzy Johnson]]====\nSuzy seems to admire her grandmother, as Suzy has shown compassion, the latter even hugging her grandmother. During Hildegard's rematch against the Flynn-Fletcher family, she automatically asked Suzy, indicating that she is somewhat aware of her granddaughter's darker persona (\"[[Crack That Whip]]\").\n====[[Jeremy Johnson]]====\nHildegard seems to command great respect amongst her grandson, as he sportingly \"battled\" against the Flynn-Fletchers (\"[[Crack That Whip]]\").\n====Annabelle Johnson====\nWhen Annabelle was little she ''\"wandered off''\", but when Candace brought her to the Jonhson's family picnic, Hildegard was so overjoyed that she changed her opinion of Candace (\"[[Run, Candace, Run]]\").\n===Flynn-Fletchers===\n====[[Betty Jo Flynn]]====\nHildegard and Betty-Joe are rivals from their days in the Tri-State Roller Rink. Hildegard pulled a dirty trick to win, and Betty-Joe accused her of cheating. The two mellowed and found common ground (or at least attempted) for the sake of their grandchildren (\"[[Crack That Whip]]\").\n====[[Candace Flynn]]====\nHildegard said that she didn't like Candace, likely for being the granddaughter of her old rival. She took a liking to Candace when she brought back Annabelle (\"[[Run, Candace, Run]]\").\n\n==Appearances==\n*\"[[Crack That Whip]]\" (First appearance)\n*\"[[Run, Candace, Run]]\"\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nHildegard Johnson.jpg\nRun, Candace, Run.jpg\nBetty_Jo_and_Hildegard_head_for_the_finish.jpg|Young Hildegard Johnson with Young [[Betty Jo Flynn]]\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n{{PF-Wiki}}\n{{Phineas and Ferb}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Johnson, Hildegard}}\n[[Category:Phineas and Ferb characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Grandparents]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]"
