Nick, the troublemaking macho young officer, got the nickname \u201cLoop\u2019n\u201d from his signature inside loop, which no other helicopter could perform.<ref>[http://blogs.disney.com/insider/2014/03/10/meet-the-characters-from-planes-fire-rescue/ Meet the Characters from Planes: Fire & Rescue]</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Planes: Fire & Rescue]]''===\nIn ''Planes: Fire & Rescue'', Nick appears in an episode of ''[[CHoPs]]'' that [[Dusty Crophopper]] and all of the firefighters except [[Blade Ranger]] were watching called \"''Disco Inferno''\", where he helps Blazin' Blade to catch a criminal named Chuck Shocks and save a female car named Pinta from a burning studio. Afterward, Sergeant \"Rhodey\" Rhodes Graeter tells him and Blade that they did a good job, and Nick states to Blade that Pinta has a sister named Peggy.\n\nWhile Blade was being repaired after he got injured upon protecting [[Dusty Crophopper|Dusty]] from a fire, [[Maru]] tells Dusty that Nick was killed in a severe accident during the filming of ''CHoPs''<nowiki>'</nowiki> 139th episode caused by a cross-breeze and Blade was unable to save Nick in time, resulting in the show being canceled, and Blade to quit his job as an actor and train under [[Mayday]] and later move to [[Piston Peak National Park]].\n\n==Trivia==\n*\"''CHoPs''\" is a parody of ''CHiPs'', a real TV show that Nick's actor Erik Estrada starred in as highway patrolman Francis \"Ponch\" Poncherello.\n**Nick and Blazin' Blade Ranger have the exact same helmets as Estrada and Larry Wilcox in the show ''CHiPs''.\n**Coincidentally enough, ''CHiPs'' was cancelled after 139 episodes due to Erik Estrada being injured in a severe accident. However, unlike Nick, who perished, Estrada actually eventually survived and recovered from that accident, which is why he is there to voice Nick today.\n**Nick is based on Ponch from the original show personality wise.\n*Originally, Nick was called Loopin' Lance Gyro.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nNick Loop'N Lopez - Planes Fire and Rescue.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Planes}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lopez, Nick}}\n[[fi:Niki Silmukka-Lopez]]\n[[pl:Nick ,,P\u0119tla\" Lopez]]\n[[pt-br:Nick Loopin' Lopez]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Planes characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]"
