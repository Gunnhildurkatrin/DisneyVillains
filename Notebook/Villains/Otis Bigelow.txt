Bigelow forces them to perform a clown act, during the upcoming air show. However, when Secord doesn't show up, Bigelow threatens to fire him. Unbeknownst to Bigelow, this prompts Malcolm, one of Secord's friends, to take Secord's place. When Malcolm begins to have trouble, Bigelow tries to assure the audience that it's all part of the show. Something he continues to do, when a flying man appears and saves Malcolm. Bigelow sets himself up as the man behind the flying man, whom he names the \"Rocketeer\". However, this results in [[Lothar]] seeking him out, for information. The FBI finds Bigelow in his office, broken in half and dead.\n\n== [[Disney Parks]] ==\n=== Atwater Ink and Paint Art Supply ===\nThere is an advert on a bulletin-board for Bigelow's Air Circus in this [[Buena Vista Street]] location.\n\n=== [[Jock Lindsey's Hangar Bar]] ===\nThere are two allusions to Bigelow's Air Circus in this [[Disney Springs]] bar, both identifying [[Society of Explorers and Adventurers|SEA]] member [[Jock Lindsey]] as having worked for Otis.  One is for a 1938 performance in Chaplin Airfield, Los Angelos while the other for a 1939 performance.\n\n==Trivia==\n* Jock Lindsey's Hangar Bar identifies historic aviatrix Pancho Barnes as having previously worked for Bigelow.\n\n{{The Rocketeer}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Rocketeer characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:S.E.A. characters]]"
