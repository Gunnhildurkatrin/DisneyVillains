He is very interested in [[Angel (Lady and the Tramp)|Angel]] and calls her \"his girl\", even though she clearly despises him and repeatedly emphasizes this. He pretends to be nice to [[Scamp]] when he tried to make him a Junkyard Dog. But in reality, Buster is a selfish, jealous and arrogant jerk who uses Scamp to get revenge on [[Tramp]] for choosing Lady over him, even though he should have been supportive of Tramp for finding love.  For Buster, what makes a dog a dog is living free, doing whatever they want and not having owners.\n\n==Role in the film==\nBuster is first seen throwing [[the Dogcatcher]]'s hat; later on when he discovers [[Scamp]], he decides that before he can make him a \"Junkyard Dog\" he'll give him a \"test\" to show that he's brave enough. The test is to retrieve a can from [[Reggie]]'s alley. However, Scamp ended up getting Reggie sent to the dog pound (in addition to saving Angel) after a big chase, which makes the Junkyard Dogs look up to him and made Buster, who tries to convince Scamp that a Junkyard Dog is only supposed to help itself and not help others, jealous. Later that day, the Junkyard Dogs reveal to Scamp that [[Tramp]] (Scamp's father) and Buster were once best friends, and Buster, who is fed up with [[Sparky (Lady and the Tramp)|Sparky]]'s false tale of Tramp's fate, reveals the real version of why Tramp left the Junkyard Dogs: He fell in love with [[Lady]], which Buster considers a betrayal to their friendship. He stresses how angry he was that Tramp didn't follow the rules.\n\nThe next day, on the Fourth of July celebration, Buster is seen watching Scamp's family from the bushes and realizes the relationship between Tramp and Scamp by seeing that they scratch in the same manner. He then tells Scamp that for his \"final test\" he wants him to wreck their picnic and steal their chicken. Scamp does so to prove that he isn't a house dog. Buster then leads the Junkyard Dogs to wreak havoc on the celebrations and then meets up with Scamp (and Tramp) in a deadend alley where he convinces Scamp to abandon his father, which Scamp does, leaving poor Tramp depressed. Buster then officially lets Scamp join by removing his collar.\n\nLater, when [[Angel (Lady and the Tramp)|Angel]] confronts Scamp on choosing to be a Junkyard Dog instead of returning to his family, Scamp accidentally reveals Angel's secret wish to have a family, and Buster kicks her out of [[The Junkyard|the junkyard]]. When Scamp looks for Angel, Buster thinks Scamp wants to become a house dog and uses [[Francois (Lady and the Tramp)|one of his members]] as bait to have Scamp captured by the dogcatcher and finally achieve his revenge against Tramp. When Scamp gets caught while running from the dog catcher, he sees Buster and thinks he will rescue him. Buster refuses and leaves, ignoring him. Scamp suddenly discovers that Buster was actually doing all this for revenge, and finally realizes that a family is more than rules.\n\nAfter escaping the [[Dog Pound|dog pound]], Scamp, Tramp, [[Jock]], and [[Trusty]] go back to the junkyard, where Scamp retrieves his collar and gets revenge on Buster by trapping him underneath an enormous pile of junk. The other Junkyard Dogs, who decide to help Scamp keep his revenge, ditch Buster to find families of their own, leaving him alone and stranded while Buster begs for them to come back and get him out of the junk, possibly even trying to convince them that he promises to help other Junkyard Dogs. It is unknown if he ever got out.\n\n==Buster's Rules==\n#No one is ever adopted.\n#Stay away from other house dogs.\n#House dogs are enemies to strays.\n#No human loves.\n#Humans ruin everyone else's life.\n#Hide somewhere to avoid dogcatchers.\n#No collars.\n#No house dogs allowed.\n#No pet adoptions.\n#Must obey or you'll be kicked out.\n#Buster's trouble is Buster's trouble.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Buster is the only Junkyard Dog to have a different voice actor to do his singing; the other Junkyard Dogs' voice artists did their own singing.\n*Buster makes the rules for his new family at the junkyard and learned the first rule about being a Junkyard Dog a long time ago.\n*He is the first main antagonist ever to be shunned.\n*Buster is one of the few main villains to not die; however, his fate was unseen and is instead left to the imagination of the viewers.\n*He bears a similarity to [[Roscoe and DeSoto]]. They are all the same breed, except it is possible Buster is not a purebred Doberman. He could be a Doberman/Rottweiler {{WikipediaLink|Mongrel|mixed breed}}, also called a \"Rotterman\".\n\n{{Lady and the Tramp}}\n[[Category:Lady and the Tramp characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
