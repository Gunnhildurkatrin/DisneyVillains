"[[File:My Friends Tigger & Pooh - The Super Sleuths.jpg|250px|thumb|\"Anytime, anyplace, the Super Sleuths are on the case.\"]]\nThe '''Super Sleuths''' are a mystery-solving group made of [[Winnie-the-Pooh|Pooh]], [[Tigger]], [[Darby]] and her dog [[Buster]], seen in every episode of [[Playhouse Disney]]'s ''[[My Friends Tigger & Pooh]]''. The Super Sleuths are dedicated to solving the mysterious issues that crop up in the [[Hundred Acre Wood]]. Their friends know that when they have a problem, they may sound the Sleuther Siren, raise the Finder Flag and the Super Sleuths will be on the case. The Super Sleuths solve their problems by thinking and asking questions. They wear outfits bearing question mark icons and use Sleuther Scooters to get around.\n\nAt various times, the Super Sleuths have dubbed others as honorary or deputy Super Sleuths, including other members of the Wood and the viewers at home.\n\nA running gag is that although [[Lumpy]] recognizes Darby as a Super Sleuth, he does not Pooh and Tigger, claiming them to be someone else.\n{{Winnie the Pooh}}\n[[Category:My Friends Tigger and Pooh]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Winnie the Pooh characters]]"
