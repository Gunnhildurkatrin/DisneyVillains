'''Experiment 520''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]]. He is designed to turn bodies of water into giant waves and tsunamis capable of destroying entire planets.\u00a0Luckily, he has the ability to control the waves he creates. His one true place is making perfect waves for surfing at\u00a0[[Lahui Beach|the beach]].\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nCannonball, despite his mischievous nature, is shown to be shy and harmless, and simply loves producing waves and often tsunamis. He also has a tendency not to look before he leaps, though he is capable of controlling the waves he creates. He is rather timid around people, but gets along quite well with others once he gets to know them. Cannonball can also be very loyal and helpful to his friends, joining [[Stitch]]'s rebellion to fight off [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]].\n\n===Physical appearance===\nCannonball is a pink experiment that is slightly bigger than [[Stitch]] (although he was noticeably smaller than his younger cousin in his [[Cannonball (episode)|eponymous debut]]). He has a big posterior, two spines on his back, black eyes, a round nose, a wide mouth with sharp teeth, short ears, and a short stubby tail.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nCannonball can create a massive wave or tsunami from any body of water he jumps into, but it is also shown that he can control the waves he creates. Cannonball walks by bouncing around on his butt, and he can also roll into a ball while in midair and fight enemies by flattening them with his butt.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment 520 was the 520th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to turn bodies of water into huge, destructive waves and tsunamis. 520 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch |Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai, with 520's pod landing in a bird's nest.\n\nWhen a bird discovered 520's pod in its nest, it kicked the pod out, which landed in a nearby lake, activating the experiment. 520 then created a massive tsunami in the lake and began to casually make his way towards the ocean.\n\nWhile 520 evaded\u00a0[[Captain Gantu|Gantu]]'s clutches, the former passed through the [[Birds of Paradise Hotel]], where he then created a tsunami from one of the pools that devastated much of the hotel.\u00a0In the aftermath, 520 used the diving board to propel himself into the air\u00a0and landed atop\u00a0a palm tree, where an incompetent [[Stitch]] catapulted him away, much to\u00a0[[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]]'s discouragement.\n\n520 later made his way to a reservoir while being pursued by Lilo and Stitch, but before he could cause\u00a0a tsunami, Stitch fired a suction cup dart attached to\u00a0a rope, restraining 520. However, Gantu attacked and captured 520, who was almost stuffed into a [[Net Cannon|net]]. Stitch battled\u00a0Gantu and slipped a pineapple inside his net, thus leaving Gantu taking the net with the pineapple back to\u00a0[[Gantu's Ship|his ship]], while 520 had been recaptured in a container.\n\nLilo and Stitch then released 520, and after assuring him that they meant him no harm, the three rushed off to [[Lahui Beach|the beach]] for Lilo's sand-sculpting competition. Stitch and 520 played contentedly until Gantu came by to try and capture 520 one more time, forcing Stitch to build a life-size sand fortress around himself, Lilo, and 520.\n\nWhen Gantu began to tear into the sand castle, 520 jumped from the castle into the ocean, where the latter created a massive tsunami that washed Gantu away to [[San Francisco]], while leaving the island perfectly intact.\n\n520, christened Cannonball, later found his one true place making suitable\u00a0waves for surfing.\n\nCannonball reappeared in \"[[Elastico (episode)|Elastico]]\" as one of the audience members for Lilo's hula dance.\n\nCannonball made a cameo at the end of \"[[Swirly (episode)|Swirly]]\", where he slid into a children's wading pool.\n\nIn \"[[Houdini (episode)|Houdini]]\", Cannonball was one of the audience members for Stitch's bungled magic act.\n\nIn \"[[Finder (episode)|Finder]]\", Cannonball was seen playing poker with Stitch, [[Yin]], [[Yang]], and [[Richter]].\n\nIn \"[[Dupe (episode)|Dupe]]\", Cannonball was one of the experiments that came\u00a0to Lilo and Stitch's slumber party wearing\u00a0traditional pajamas. However, he was forced by [[Pleakley]] to leave due to his destructive behavior.\n\nIn \"[[Angel (episode)|Angel]]\", Cannonball was one of the experiments that\u00a0[[Angel ]] reverted to evil using her song. Later, Cannonball and the other\u00a0depraved experiments attacked Stitch aboard a ship, but Angel turned them back to good before they could finish Stitch off. Working together, the experiments were then able to successfully escape the ship with Stitch.\n\nCannonball made another cameo in \"[[Felix (episode)|Felix]]\", where he was destroying\u00a0the beach with his tidal waves. He was eventually stopped by Stitch, and while Lilo convinced Cannonball to tone down\u00a0his waves, Stitch cleaned up the beach.\n\nCannonball was one of the experiments in \"[[Checkers (episode)|Checkers]]\" that joined Stitch in a rebellion against Gantu.\n\nIn \"[[Remmy (episode)|Remmy]]\", Cannonball was one of the experiments in Lilo's dream.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nIn the film's opening, Cannonball can be seen waving hello to [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], along with [[Yin]] and [[Yang]]. He was also seen later in the movie making perfect\u00a0waves for surfing as Lilo was making her rounds with [[Scrump]] to make sure all the experiments were happy in the one true place they belonged.\n\nLater, the first 624 experiments, including Cannonball, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, Lilo, [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]] and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nCannonball participated in the following battle between the experiments and the\u00a0[[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]] by flattening attacking Leroys with his butt.\n\nHowever, the Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Cannonball was first revealed in a DVD bonus feature of ''[[Stitch! The Movie]]'' in the experiment gallery.\n*Cannonball and [[Tickle-Tummy]] are the only known experiments that mostly bounce when traversing land.\u00a0\n*Cannonball's [[Experiment Pods|pod]]\u00a0color is blue.\n*Cannonball never rolled into a ball in ''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''. However, in ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]'', Cannonball was briefly shown to be able to roll into a ball in midair\u00a0before he was captured by a [[Leroy]] [[Leroy Clones|clone]].\n*Cannonball's body appears in the online game ''[[Jumba's Lab (Game)|Jumba's Lab]]''.\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cannonball}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
