The King was supervising his right-hand man [[Doli]], who was repairing the scaffolding of the whirlpool, and the work was interrupted by the arrival of Taran and his fellas. After Doli revealed that [[Hen Wen]], the pig, had arrived among the [[Fair Folk]], to Taran's great joy, the King asked his lieutenant to go get him. He asks humans what is happening on the surface. Taran reveals the intentions of the [[Horned King]], that if he gets his hands on the black Cauldron, everyone will be condemned. The King reassures the humans that the Cauldron is well guarded by the [[Witches of Morva]], so Taran decides to go there to destroy the Cauldron so that the Horned King cannot use it.
