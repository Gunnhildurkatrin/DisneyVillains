She speaks with a British accent. She used to belong to Tisha, Doc and Donny's big cousin, but Tisha gave her to Doc in the episode \"[[Through the Reading Glasses]]\". Doc introduces her to the other toys and Professor Hootsburgh decides to read them ''Goldilocks and the Three Bears''. Stuffy gets out the book and accidentally lands on her. But she can't make out the words, so Doc takes her to the clinic for a check-up. Stuffy miserably thinks he must have hurt Professor Hootsburgh, but Doc forgives him. She calls her diagnosis 'glasses-gone itis' and realizes that Stuffy didn't hurt her after all, or she forgot how to read; she just forgot her glasses. Professor Hootsburgh had left her glasses at Tisha's house, so Doc and her friends find her a new pair of glasses. The perfect pair of glasses works when Professor takes one more test for the eye chart. At the end of the episode, Professor Hootsburgh reads everyone \"Goldilocks and the Three Bears\", though Stuffy keeps interrupting frequently.\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nDoc&Hootsburg.png\nSo Proud to Be Med Students-009.jpg\nSo Proud to Be Med Students-012.jpg\nProfessor hootsburgh as she appears in doc's summertime clinic.jpg|Professor Hootsburgh as she appears in the game Doc's Summertime Clinic\n</gallery>\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Doc McStuffins}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hootsburgh}}\n[[Category:Owls]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Toys]]\n[[Category:Doc McStuffins characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
