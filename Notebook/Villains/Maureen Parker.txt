She is also [[Oscar Proud]] and [[Leslie Parker]]'s mother-in-law from ''[[The Proud Family]]'' episode; \"[[Behind the Family Lines]]\".\n\n==Role in the episode==\nMaureen Parker is first seen arriving with her husband, [[Dr. Vincent Parker|Dr. Vincent]], their daughter, [[Diana Parker|Diana]], their son, [[Reuben Parker|Reuben]] and his family: his wife, [[Leslie Parker|Leslie]] and his daughter, [[Chanel Parker|Chanel]] in Reuben's SUV truck at their daughter, [[Trudy Proud]] and her husband, [[Oscar Proud]]'s house for their grandchildren, [[BeBe & CeCe Proud|BeBe and CeCe]]'s baptism since it was their granddaughter, [[Penny Proud|Penny]]'s idea in the first place.\n\nShe and her husband greet their granddaughter, Penny as her husband compliments on how beautiful Penny's becoming everyday and looking more like her mother. Despite Oscar showing good manners, Maureen and her husband still show an unknown reason to dislike him. Later, Maureen criticizes [[Suga Mama]] and her cleaning since she mistakes her for Trudy's maid at first, which sparks a small feud between both grandmothers.\n\nWith so many relatives staying in the same house now (including Oscar's cousin [[Ray Ray Proud, Sr.|Ray Ray Proud]] and his family: his wife, [[Boonnetta Proud|Boonnetta]] and their sons, [[Ray Ray Proud, Jr.|Ray Ray, Jr.]] and [[S'mo Proud|S'mo]]), Oscar and his family are forced to sleep in a tent. Later, Mrs. Parker and the rest of the families join Oscar and his family for dinner when Oscar calls them down. However, their dinner is interrupted by Penny saying grace and Ray Ray, Jr. and S'mo having eaten everything. Luckily, Oscar knows a place where they can all eat, The Red Clam, and he promises to pay. During the dinner at the restaurant, a family food fight occurs when Dr. Parker starts fighting with S'mo over a lobster and calling him a baby behemoth, which leads to S'mo accidentally smacking Mrs. Parker with a lobster and then her throwing a clam at Boonnetta for smacking her husband with a fish earlier.\n\nThe next morning, at the Proud/Parker family picnic, Mrs. Parker and her family are seen arguing with the Proud family over a game of Red Light - Green Light. Later, Mrs. Parker and her family are playing touch football against the Proud family, where they win at the end through cheating by having their pet Dachshund, [[Coco (Proud Family)|Coco]] win for them, which leads to yet another family fight and argument.\n\nAfter Penny, Chanel, and Ray Ray, Jr. are caught driving the mind-reading SUV truck by [[Sunset Boulevardez]] while on their way to the mall and to get away from their feuding families, another family argument and fight breaks out when each family member accuses either child for the idea in the first place, which eventually leads Maureen and her family to leave despite Dr. Parker feeling sorry for not attending the twins' baptism. Then, Ray Ray and his family leave.\n\nLuckily, Penny is able to convince her grandmother and her family that Ray Ray and his family have left and vice versa, which convinces them to attend the baptism the next day. In the morning, at the church, Maureen and her family are mad to see Ray Ray and his family having arrived as well, which leads to another fight until Penny silences them and Chanel and Ray Ray, Jr. join her to remind them how ridiculous they've been acting and what family really means to them, which leads to both families finally reconciling and making amends despite Maureen being upset to know that her husband found it funny when she got clogged by Suga Mama during the football game the other day.\n\nAt night, all families are having a peaceful dinner at the Proud family's home until Ray Ray, Jr. and S'mo start fighting over some pudding, which leads to yet another food fight but a little bit friendlier and amusing this time.\n\n==Trivia==\n*During the scene where Maureen and Suga Mama were fighting and arguing at the church, Maureen was seen with a cane when in fact, Suga Mama is only one seen with a cane most of the time in all episodes.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nProudparkerfamilyintro.png|Maureen Parker during the intro\nVlcsnap-2016-06-10-18h04m02s971.png\nVlcsnap-2016-06-10-18h04m28s480.png\nVlcsnap-2016-06-13-16h34m44s761.png\nVlcsnap-2016-06-13-17h01m06s114.png\nVlcsnap-2016-06-10-18h16m36s942.png\nVlcsnap-2016-06-13-17h03m51s326.png\nVlcsnap-2016-06-17-14h46m24s284.png\nVlcsnap-2016-06-13-17h05m28s586.png\nVlcsnap-2016-06-13-17h09m51s594.png\nVlcsnap-2016-06-13-17h10m47s789.png\n27C96EFE-6754-4D71-8938-8702FA064C87.jpeg|Maureen fighting with her relatives in the promotional artwork for \u201cBehind Family Lines\u201d.\n</gallery>\n{{The Proud Family}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Proud Family characters]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Grandparents]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]"
