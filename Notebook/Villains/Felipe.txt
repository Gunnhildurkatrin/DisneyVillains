Sometimes, his ideas make the problem worse.\n\nHe provides a lot of the Spanish language content in the show, translating for the other tools. He also loves to sing.\n==Personality==\nFelipe is the opposite of Turner. While he means well, he can be a show-off sometimes and has a habit of bragging a lot, much to the other tools' and especially Turner's annoyance. Felipe believes he's powerful. He also loves to sing, but isn't that great at it; in the episode \"[[Ice Cream Team]]\", his singing scared off Se\u00f1or Sanchez and his granddaughter Julietta while he and Turner were trying to sell ice cream. Turner then remarked that if he kept singing they would have to start giving away the ice cream, much to Felipe's annoyance. Nevertheless, this doesn't stop him from trying.\n\nHe also has a habit of getting under Turner's skin-sometimes purposefully-and loves to be in the center of attention. Felipe also entered the talent show in Talent Show\u00a0when he sang a song for his act. Felipe also seems to be a big fan of Supremoguy. He even thought he was him once. Felipe's favorite beverage is Aqua Fresca.\n\nHe is a good friend of [[Flicker]] because of the fact that both can communicate with each other. Felipe hates Turner because they are two different screwdrivers, but in some episodes, he bonds with Turner, and on occasions where they're forced to work together, they do their jobs well. Felipe speaks Spanish very fluently. However, ironically Felipe has to clear his throat before he spoke to Flicker as if he were to forget his Spanish in the episode, \"[[Flicker (episode)|Flicker]]\".\n\n==Trivia==\n*His name is a pun on \"Phllip Screwdriver\".\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nFelipe and turner.jpg|Turner interacting with Felipe.\nFlicker and other.png\nFelipe turner.png\nA sticky fix.png\nFelipe-1.png\nMannytoolbox.png\nMannytools.png\nToolgang.png\nPlayhouse Disney HM.jpg\nmanny-tools-guitar.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Handy Manny}}\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Handy Manny characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Playhouse Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Magical Objects]]\n[[Category:Special Agent Oso characters]]\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Tools]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]"
