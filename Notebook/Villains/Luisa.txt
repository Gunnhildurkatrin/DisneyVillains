She is [[Princess Elena]], [[Princess Isabel]], and [[Chancellor Esteban]]'s maternal grandmother.\n\n==Personality==\nAs Elena points out, Luisa is an optimist who always looks on the bright side of things. However, this is never to the point of being naive, for she has a very sharp attention to detail. She is also revealed to be an excellent cook and to have a dislike for being kept in the dark. She is also more open-minded than her husband and grandson. Luisa showed her tough and competitive side when she trained her Olaball team because she was determined to win, going a bit overboard in the process. She is also very protective of her family and will spring to their defense instantly; when she learned that Lord Elrod had purposefully injured her daughter Queen Lucia in a fencing tournament years prior, she was furious enough to threaten him with a duel. However, like Elena, she isn't the most reasonable of his family, as she couldn't forgive Esteban for causing Shuriki to attack them and did not see that Esteban had changed for the better slide and along with Elena and Naomi sentenced Esteban to exile, with Luisa believing he was too easy on Esteban.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Elena and the Secret of Avalor]]''===\nLuisa appears in the special, ''Elena and the Secret of Avalor''. When the sorceress Shuriki attacked the Kingdom of Avalor and killed [[King Raul and Queen Lucia]], [[Alacazar]], the Royal Sorcerer, decided to keep the surviving members of the Royal Family safe by placing her, her husband Francisco, and her youngest granddaughter Princess Isabel inside an Enchanted Painting while her eldest granddaughter Crown Princess Elena faced Shuriki alone to buy him time. They succeeded and the three of them were placed inside the painting where they would remain for forty-one years until Elena finally let them out and defeats Shuriki.\n\n===''[[Elena of Avalor]]''===\nIn the series that serves as the special's sequel, Luisa appears as a major character. She is a member of the Grand Council, who was chosen by Elena for her optimism. Through the show, Luisa, along with her husband, assists Elena in her journey to becoming Queen.\n\nDuring Season 2, upon learning of Shuriki's return, she agrees with Esteban, Naomi, and Francisco with keeping Elena in the Royal Palace under heavy guard from Gabe and the Royal Guards for her own protection. Gabe maintains this even when Luisa is away on a diplomatic visit to a neighboring kingdom with Francisco and Esteban.\n\nLater, she and Francisco are happy to hear that Isabel is starting her weekly classes at the Avalor Science Academy with Professor Ochoa and wish her good luck, but Elena is hesitant to let her go alone, to the point she wants to send a detachment of the Royal Guards to protect Isabel, but Luisa shoots down that idea, convincing Elena to just go herself.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nLuisa.jpg|Luisa concept\nElena of Avalor 2D cast concept.png\nIsabel, Francisco & Luisa.jpg|Luisa with her husband and youngest grandchild\nElena and the Secret of Avalor Elena Francisco.jpg\nElena of Avalor 01.jpg|Luisa with her friends and family\nElena of Avalor 06.jpg\nFirst Day of Rule 1.png\nModel Sister King Toshi Princess Elena.jpg|Luisa, her husband, and her grandchildren welcome King Toshi\nNavidad 1.jpg\nBlockheads 26.png\nThree Jaquins and a Princess 12.jpg\nThree Jaquins and a Princess 13.jpg\nThe Tides of Change 15.jpg\nThe Tides of Change 36.jpg\nSnow Place Like Home 4.png\nElena of Avalor S3 2.jpg\nElena of Avalor S3 7.jpg\nDreamcatcher (5).jpg\nLusia with Baby Isabel.png\nDia de las Madres Luisa and baby Isabel.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Elena of Avalor}}\n{{Sofia the First}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Luisa}}\n[[Category:Elena of Avalor characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Grandparents]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]\n[[Category:Politicians]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Sofia the First characters]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Coaches]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
