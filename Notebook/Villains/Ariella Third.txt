But she seems to be soft-spoken and could possibly be just as quiet as her sister at times.\n\n===Physical Appearance===\nShe has a hairstyle that is more asymmetrical, as opposed to Ingrid's, but has the same colors: Black with white streaks (one straight, the other having slightly, squiggly edges), one streak going across the fringe; the other going vertically, from the top of the bumpy part to the other end that meets one end of the horizontal streak. She has pale skin, green eyes and her apparel includes black cat-eye glasses, green shirt with a small V-collar, and brown jacket with matching skirt.\n\n==\"[[A Cold Day at X]]\"==\nAriella's sole appearance is in the episode\u00a0,<ref>\"A Cold Day at X\"</ref> when she and Ingrid are seen in the kitchen of their house cooking some soup for their dad to cure his cold. After tasting it, she speaks once, saying \"Needs more aloe\". She was also mentioned twice: once in\u00a0,<ref>\"Nappers Never Sleep\"</ref> when [[Cornelius Fillmore|Fillmore]] asks Ingrid if she has any siblings and once in\u00a0,<ref>\"Of Slain Kings on Checkered Fields\"</ref> when the rapper\u00a0'''Checkmatey'''\u00a0asks if Ingrid has a sister and whether she looks like her. Ingrid replies, \"taller\".\n\n==Episode Appearances==\n\n*\"[[Nappers Never Sleep]]\" (mentioned)\n*\"[[A Cold Day at X]]\"\n*\"[[Of Slain Kings on Checkered Fields]]\" (mentioned)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Fillmore!}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Third, Ariella}}\n[[Category:Fillmore characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]"
