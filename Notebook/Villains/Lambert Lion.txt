He is initially very cowardly until his adoptive mother is put in danger, whereupon he displays amazing courage.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lambert the Sheepish Lion]]''===\nLambert is brought to a meadow on accident by a [[Mr. Stork|stork]]. Upon seeing the lambs with their new mothers, he chooses [[Mrs. Sheep]] to be his mother, much to her joy. The stork realizes his mistake almost immediately, and attempts to take the lion cub to [[Africa|South Africa]] where he belongs, but is quickly stopped via a headbutt from Mrs. Sheep.\n\nLambert attempts to play with the other lambs, but he is [[Lambert the Sheepish Lion (song)|teased]] for his decidedly un-sheeplike appearance and habits. They make him bleat but he only meows due to being a cub. This culminates in a headbutting contest which Lambert loses badly, leading to his cowardly habits.\n\nBy fall, Lambert has become an adult lion under Mrs. Sheep's care, but still remains the butt of the jokes of the now-grown sheep. This changes one night when a [[Wolf (Make Mine Music)|wolf]] attacks Mrs. Sheep, and when he threatens Mrs. Sheep, Lambert is petrified and assumes the flock will help, but they run and hide. Hearing his mother bleat for help, Lambert snaps and becomes a raging lion, roaring at the wolf and headbutting him off the cliff he stands on. Due to his courage, Lambert is held in high regard by the sheep who had previously teased him.\n\n===''[[Social Lion]]''===\nLambert (unnamed) lives in [[Africa]], where he roars to scare off all the other animals. He then gets sent off to the city, where he causes more chaos. He later arrives in a zoo and wreaks even more havoc with his roaring, until he is eventually taken back to Africa.\n\n===''[[Quack Pack]]''===\nLambert made a brief cameo as one of the living lions owned by [[Andre Demouche]] in the\u00a0episode \"[[Cat & Louse]]\".\n\n===''[[DuckTales]]''===\nLambert appears as one of the animals alongside [[Dolores the Elephant]] at the [[Duckburg]] Zoo in the episode \"[[The Money Vanishes]]\".\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*The lion that appears in the [[1954]]\u00a0Disney short ''[[Social Lion]]'' bears a striking resemblance to Lambert, even having the same only line of dialogue, \"Mama?!\" This is due to much animation from\u00a0''[[Lambert the Sheepish Lion]]'' being reused for ''Social Lion''.\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lion, Lambert}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Lions]]\n[[Category:Orphans]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:DuckTales characters]]\n[[Category:Quack Pack characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]"
