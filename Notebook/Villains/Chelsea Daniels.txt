She is [[Raven Baxter|Raven]]'s best female friend during her stay at [[Bayside High School]]\u00a0and later moves in with her, in ''[[Raven's Home]]. ''She is portrayed by [[Anneliese van der Pol]].\n==Background==\n\n===Personality===\nChelsea was always nearly portrayed as either absent-minded or a bit air-headed, not understanding the most simple, obvious things. Though she can be absent-minded, she deeply cares about her friends and would never let them down. She is very pretty and down-to-earth. Chelsea is an environmentalist.\n\nHowever, she is very gifted in other areas. She is great with animals and works in a dog groomer, where the owner said she was the best groomer they had. She also has great leadership skills, taking charge of several protests and is president of her school's greenery preservation club. She is also a teenage prodigy in arts. In early episodes, she was fairly intelligent and this was dropped to give her more personality.\n\nChelsea is the opposite of her \"fashionista\" friend [[Raven Baxter|Raven]]. She enjoys nature and loves camping (she's even able to find edible foods and fungus out in the woods). She's also very spiritual in contrast to the \"materialistic\" [[Raven Baxter|Raven]]. She can sometimes be found meditating or doing things for 'spiritual' health. Though this sometimes leads into trouble as she caused her friends to argue over a goat and in a vision turned herself and Raven into cows.\n\nShe also likes to make jokes, which only she would laugh at. Despite her apparent lack of common sense and intelligence, she has a few surprises up her sleeve\u2014such as occasionally knowing certain \"smart\" things, which usually tends to surprise everyone else.\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n=== ''[[That's So Raven]]'' ===\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n=== ''[[Raven's Home]]'' ===\nSet years after the original, Chelsea is now a divorced single mother to a son named [[Levi]]. Her ex-husband is a man named Garrett, but they got divorced after Garrett had an affair with a female federal agent (who later has him arrested for tax fraud and sent to prison). Chelsea and Levi end up moving in with Raven, who, like Chelsea, is now a divorced single mother (but to boy-girl fraternal twins named Booker and Nia, the former of whom inherited Raven's psychic abilities).\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==References==\n<references />{{DEFAULTSORT:Daniels, Chelsea}}\n\n{{That's So Raven}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:That's So Raven characters]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Cattle]]\n[[Category:Raven's Home characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Cows]]"
