However, after one of [[Pete|Professor Inferiority's]] minions got caught in one of Sherlock's mousetraps, he went from exterminator to detective overnight, with Sparky becoming his sidekick.\n\n===Personality===\nSparky enjoys a good laugh, even at the expense of other people. He is also arrogant, rolling his eyes as Sherlock received praise for catching one of [[Pete|Professor Inferiority's]] minions.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nSparky is a typical, small, gray mouse. Unlike other non-anthropomorphic animals of the series, though, Sparky does have the limited ability to talk, albeit in short phrases and one-word sentences.\n\n===Role in the series===\nHe only appears in the Goof History episode, \"[[Sherlock Goof]]\". He initially was a bother to the protagonist, [[Goofy|Sherlock Goof]], but after receiving fame for the capturing of one of [[Pete|Professor Inferiority's]] minions, he became Sherlock's sidekick.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Another character from Goof Troop is also named Sparky. He is the [[Myron the Bulk|Bulk's]] manager in the episode, \"[[The Incredible Bulk (Goof Troop)]].\n**Ironically, both characters are voiced by Frank Welker.\n\n{{Goof Troop}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Goof Troop characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Mice]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Detectives]]\n[[Category:Deuteragonists]]\n[[Category:Historical characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]"
