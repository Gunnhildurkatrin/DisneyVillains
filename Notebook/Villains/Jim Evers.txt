You wanna kill me, kill me. But listen, when I come on the other side, I'm gonna just be whipping your ass for all eternity.|Jim to [[Master Gracey]]}}\n\n'''Jim Evers''' is the main protagonist of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s [[2003]] comedy horror film, ''[[The Haunted Mansion (2003 film)|The Haunted Mansion]]''. He and his wife, [[Sara Evers|Sara]], are real estate agents for Evers and Evers Real Estate. He says that he does not believe in ghosts until he finally meets them for himself.\n\n==Role in the film==\nJim is obsessed with his job so much so that he blows off dinner with Sara to sell a house. To make it up to her he wants to take their family on a vacation with a stop at the Gracey Manor. A heavy rainstorm traps them there, and they are forced to spend the night in peace. Or so they hoped. Jim discovers that when the head of the bust in the library is bent down it opens a secret door in the wall. On the other side of a tunnel he passes the busts whose heads follow him as he walks to a breathing door. Through it is a ringing phone. He answers, with no reply, sees a crow then looks in the mirror and hallucinates that he looks like a zombie. He follows [[Madame Leota]]'s voice and unwillingly joins her seance. He runs away screaming because he is being chased by flying instruments until he reaches the attic stairs. He realizes [[Ezra]] and [[Emma (The Haunted Mansion)|Emma]] are ghosts, who tell him that his wife is [[Master Gracey|Master Edward Gracey]]'s [[Elizabeth Henshaw|dead ]][[Elizabeth Henshaw|fianc\u00e9e]]. They return to Madame Leota who tells them the way to escape.\n\nAs they go outside, he begins to see the former inhabitants as ghosts. He goes down into the mausoleum with [[Megan Evers|Megan]] to find the key in \"a black crypt with no name\" and must pry it from the corpse's hands. He drops it as the [[Zombies (Haunted Mansion)|zombie]] follows after him. He knocks its head off only to awaken more zombies. He and Megan try to escape with the key, but the door shuts as they reach it, and spiders cover the outside. After a few tense moments, [[Michael Evers|Michael]] overcomes his arachnophobia long enough to open the door. Jim returns to Madame Leota who says he must find the chest it opens. In the chest there is a letter that says Elizabeth wanted to marry Master Gracey and [[Ramsley]] reveals he poisoned her. He is soon thrown from the window by Ramsley and lands on his car outside. He tries to break in through the windows but they only keep fixing themselves. Madame Leota comes to talk him into continuing to try to rescue his family. On the way to stop the wedding, he sees his kids guarded by knights and fights them.\n\nJim shows Master Gracey the real letter Elizabeth wrote. As Ramsley is being dragged to damnation, he grabs Jim's legs but soon loses his grip. He holds Sara, the [[Iocane Powder|poison]] taking effect, as she dies but the magical orb lands on her and her soul returns from Heaven. Master Gracey gives Jim the deed to the mansion for heroism. He and his family watch the spirits of all of the mansion's inhabitants float up to Heaven. In the end, the Evers, along with Madame Leota and [[The Phantom Five|four singing busts]], drive into the sunset.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Jim Evers holds the distinction of uttering the word \"ass\" more than once in reference to the actual body part.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"175\">\nThe Haunted Mansion Poster - The Reluctant Guest.jpg|Promotional poster of Jim Evers\nhaunted-mansion-disneyscreencaps.com-336.jpg\nHaunted-mansion-disneyscreencaps.com-1230.jpg\nHaunted-mansion-disneyscreencaps.com-2261.jpg\nHaunted-mansion-disneyscreencaps.com-2817.jpg|Jim meets Ramsley\nHaunted-mansion-disneyscreencaps.com-4068.jpg\nHaunted-mansion-disneyscreencaps.com-4253.jpg\nHaunted-mansion-disneyscreencaps.com-4265.jpg\nHaunted-mansion-disneyscreencaps.com-4945.jpg\nHaunted-mansion-disneyscreencaps.com-5321.jpg\nHaunted-mansion-disneyscreencaps.com-5273.jpg\nHaunted-mansion-disneyscreencaps.com-7066.jpg\nhaunted-mansion-disneyscreencaps.com-7469.jpg|Jim choked by Ramsley before the latter tosses him out.\nhaunted-mansion-disneyscreencaps.com-8438.jpg\nHaunted-mansion-disneyscreencaps.com-8698.jpg|Jim hands Gracey the real letter Elizabeth wrote, exposing Ramsley's betrayal.\nHaunted-mansion-disneyscreencaps.com-9403.jpg\nHaunted-mansion-disneyscreencaps.com-9613.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Haunted Mansion}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:The Haunted Mansion characters]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:American characters]]"
