Aside from usually calling him the deriding nickname of the Wart, Kay treats Arthur rather cruelly, often trying to physically attack him for his mistakes. However, at the end when Arthur becomes King, he comes to respect Arthur as the King and his foster brother. He also shows guilt for the way he treated him in the past.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nSir Kay is\u00a0based on the character of the same name from the King Arthur legends, who like the Disney character, was Arthur's adoptive brother. He\u00a0is a big, muscular young man with red hair, and is most likely somewhere around the age of twenty, judging from a line from\u00a0[[Merlin]].\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[The Sword in the Stone]]''===\nSir Kay is first seen hunting a deer with his bow and arrow. He aims at the deer but misses due to Arthur falling down on top of him. \n\nKay tries to hit Arthur who attempts to apologize.\u00a0Kay ignores it and tells him \u201cIf I ever get my hands on you, I\u2019ll wring your scrawny little neck. So help me, I will!\u201d Arthur goes to the entrance of the forest and hides from Kay behind a tree. To make up for the mistake, he offers to go look for the arrow, telling Kay, \u201cI\u2019m sure I can find it.\u201d\u00a0Kay laughs at Arthur and tells him surely he won\u2019t go in the forest, \u201cWhy, it\u2019s swarming with wolves.\u201d Arthur, however, tells him, \u201cI\u2019m not afraid.\u201d\u00a0Kay then dismisses him, \u201cGo ahead, it\u2019s your skin, not mine!\u201d Back at the castle, Sir Ector scolds Kay, who is eating a bowl of chicken legs, for allowing the Wart to go alone into the forest. Kay shows little concern, stating that he is not Arthur's keeper.\n\nWhen a wizard named [[Merlin]] appears, Kay notes that they should just run Merlin off, but Ector shoots down this idea, fearing that Merlin would curse them if angered. A little while later, [[Sir Pellinore]], Ector's friend, comes with news of a tournament on New Years Day. Kay at first pays little attention until Pellinore reveals that the winner will be King of England. Ector notes that if Kay buckles down, he could be knighted in time for the tournament, and compete to win. Kay agrees, but not before Pellinore quietly notes that Kay as the new King is a dreadful thought. At the same time though, Kay is also disappointed when Ector points out that Arthur will be accompanying them as Kay\u2019s squire, outright saying that he doesn\u2019t want the Wart for a squire. The next day, Kay is seen practicing his jousting, but it quickly becomes apparent that he is not skilled. After the fish lesson with Merlin, Kay is seen again when he and Ector refused to believe in Arthur's true story about the fish experience, leading Ector to punish the Wart by giving him more kitchen duties as a consequence for being late and for telling them about the strange fish story. Kay's next appearance is with Ector who had been summoned to the kitchen, due to the [[Scullery Maid]] warning them about what she saw in the kitchen. Having found the kitchen to be enchanted, he attempts to fight a mop, but is no match for the enchanted dishes. When Arthur and Merlin came back to the castle and when Ector berates Merlin for putting black magic over the kitchen, Kay thinks that they should run Merlin out of their castle, but Ector quickly covers his mouth, claiming that he might cast an \"evil spell\" on them by turning them into stone. Kay\u00a0is seen to be fairly pleased when Ector forbids Arthur from becoming his\u00a0squire and further suggests that Ector box Arthur's ears. Kay and Ector then leave Arthur in tears and Kay cuts the mop handle and telling Arthur, \u201cAnd that\u2019ll teach you to pop off, you little pipsqueak.\u201d\n\nAt Christmas, Kay has apparently improved enough to be knighted. When the Scullery Maid warns Ector that the new squire, Hobbs, has come down with the mumps, Arthur is called by Ector to be the replacement. There is no other choice, so Arthur accompanies Kay to the tournament in [[London]], along with Ector and Pellinore.\n\nSir Kay is waiting to fight when he discovers that Arthur has forgotten his sword back at the inn. Kay threatens the Wart to bring it or never come back. When Arthur brings the legendary [[Sword in the Stone (object)|Sword in the Stone]] as a replacement, Kay is quick to realize it is not his but is apparently ignorant as to what it really is. When the sword is returned to the stone to allow Arthur to prove he pulled it, Kay shoves him aside and tries to pull it himself insisting \"Anyone can pull it once it\u2019s been pulled.\u201d \n\nWhen he fails to pull the sword out, Pellinore and one of the knights, [[Sir Bart]], suggests that Arthur should try pulling it out. When he does, Kay is seen to realize for the first time how special Arthur was and appears to regret his cruel treatment of him as he kneels down before him as Ector begs Arthur's forgiveness.\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\nSir Kay was seen in \"[[Ask Von Drake]]\" with [[Arthur Pendragon|Arthur]], [[Merlin]], and [[Madam Mim]],\u00a0trying to pull the [[Sword in the Stone (object)|sword]] out of the stone.\n\n=== ''[[Once Upon a Time]]'' ===\nKnowing that Merlin prophesied that Arthur shall pull out Excalibur from the stone, Sir Kay arrives their first, wanting to become the Ruler of Camelot. Arthur warns him not to take it, but Kay defies him and does so anyway. As he wasn't meant to be the one to pull it out, the sword glows and turns Kay to dust.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*The way Sir Ector accidentally bumps his sword into Sir Kay's head and Sir Kay moans in pain when trying to attack the enchanted kitchen supplies is similar to the way [[Jasper and Horace|Horace]] accidentally bumped his club/chair leg into [[Jasper and Horace|Jasper]]'s head and Jasper moaned in pain when trying to attack the puppies in ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians|101 Dalmatians]]'', only Sir Ector doesn't get kicked in the rear by Sir Kay for his clumsiness as Jasper does to Horace because he is Kay's father and he'll get mad at him for it.\n*The main character for Don Bluth's video game ''Dragon's Lair'', Dirk Daring, appears to have been modeled after him.\n\n{{The Sword in the Stone}}\n{{Once Upon a Time}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kay, Sir}}\n[[Category:The Sword in the Stone characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Hunters]]\n[[Category:Knights]]\n[[Category:Archers]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:English characters]]\n[[Category:Arthurian Legends]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Once Upon a Time characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]"
