Feyersied|occupation=[[Fireside Girls]] Founder|alignment=Good|alias=Mrs. Feyersied<br>Ma'am}}\n'''Eliza M. Feyersied''' is the founder of the [[Fireside Girls]]. She is first seen in a window that looks like a painting. She helps [[Candace Flynn|Candace]] to get her tickets to the Paisley Sideburn Brothers concert by allowing her to become a Fireside Girl if she earns 50 patches. Candace fails to earn the final patch in time, but she gives her a special patch for breaking the all-time record and awards her with the tickets (\"[[Fireside Girl Jamboree]]\").\n\nShe is very elderly and uses a walker. Since she founded the Fireside Girls, she knows everything about the group and the people in it. She also built the Fireside Girls clubhouse, which is a log cabin in the middle of downtown [[Danville]].\n==Trivia==\n*Her surname, Feyersied, sounds very similar to \"Fireside\".\n*She makes a cameo in \"[[Lights, Candace, Action!]]\" when the audience turns old on the back row in a purple dress.\n==Appearances==\n*\"[[Lights, Candace, Action!]]\" {{Cameo}}\n*\"[[Fireside Girl Jamboree]]\"\n*\"[[Night of the Living Pharmacists]]\"\n{{Phineas and Ferb}}\n[[Category:Phineas and Ferb characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
