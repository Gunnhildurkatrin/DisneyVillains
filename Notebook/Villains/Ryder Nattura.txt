He is a member of the [[Northuldra]] tribe, who embraces life with optimism. Ryder's love of reindeer might just rival [[Kristoff]]'s - but unlike Kristoff, Ryder has never roamed the great plains outside of [[The Enchanted Forest|the Enchanted Forest.]] He longs to embrace the world and venture beyond the magical mist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/movies/2019/09/23/frozen-2-new-characters-disney-trailer/|title=Frozen 2 Trailer Introduces New Characters|website=ComicBook.com|date=September 23, 2019|first=Charlie|last=Ridgely|format=Article}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nRyder and his sister, [[Honeymaren]], were born in [[the Enchanted Forest]] after the war between the [[Northuldra]] and [[Arendelle|Arendellians]]. Because of the curse that prevented anyone from leaving or entering the forest, Ryder had never been outside the mist that surrounds their home.\n\nHe grew to become a reindeer herder. With an inherent connection to nature, Ryder developed a close bond with the reindeer. He would even talk for them with a goofy \u201creindeer voice\u201d, a quirk he shares with [[Kristoff]].\n\n===Personality===\nRyder is good-natured and easygoing. He has a friendly deposition, making him fast friends with those he meets. He is also quirky, as he talks for reindeer in a comical manner. Despite his love of people, he explains that he knows nothing about women, suggesting that he has never been in a relationship.\n\n==Role in the film==\nRyder is among the [[Northuldra|Northuldrans]] that confront [[Elsa]] and her party after they enter the forest. He is shocked to see that Elsa harness magic, and even more so by [[Olaf]], whose sudden appearance causes Ryder to hide behind [[Honeymaren|his sister]]. He nevertheless finds himself invested in Olaf\u2019s story explaining how he and the others found themselves in the forest.\n\nWhen the [[Bruni|Fire Spirit]] appears and sets the forest ablaze, Ryder notices the reindeer running towards a dead end. [[Kristoff]] and [[Sven]] volunteer to rescue the herd and lead them back to safety. The Fire Spirit is eventually tamed by Elsa, saving the forest and the parties from its blaze.\n\nAfterwards, the Northuldra notice Elsa putting a [[Iduna's Scarf|scarf]] around [[Anna]]'s shoulders, and Ryder reveals that it is a Northuldra scarf. This leads to the sisters discovering that their mother, [[Queen Iduna]], was Northuldra. Ryder joins his people in welcoming the sisters into their family by singing \u201c[[Vuelie]]\u201d. Elsa then promises to free the forest, which excites Ryder. He becomes acquainted with [[Kristoff]] when the former explains that he was born in the forest and has never seen the clear sky. Later at camp, Kristoff laments his failed attempts to get Anna\u2019s attention and propose. Though Ryder is unable to provide relationship advice as he knows nothing about women, he offers to share with a Kristoff and Sven the Northuldran way of proposing\u2014which happens to include lots of reindeer, much to the excitement of the trio.\n\nThat morning, after much prep, Ryder, Kristoff, and Sven await Anna\u2019s arrival. While waiting, Ryder and Kristoff realize their mutual love of reindeer also includes talking for them. Suddenly, Anna seemingly arrives, prompting Ryder to set the atmosphere. What he and Kristoff instead find is [[Yelana]], who explains that Anna and Elsa have left the camp and that the Northuldrans are heading west. A crestfallen Kristoff feels abandoned, and though Ryder tries to comfort him and invite him to join the Northuldrans, Kristoff chooses to stay behind for a bit. Ryder then heads back to camp to pack.\n\nIn the end, the Enchanted Forest is freed from the curse, thus clearing the mist that had encapsulated the land. Ryder is astonished by the sight of the sky, commenting that he never realized there was so much of it. He is last seen during the epilogue, riding a herd of reindeer alongside Honeymaren as Elsa passes them by on [[the Nokk]], being helped up the nearby cliff by the lead [[Earth Giants|Earth Giant]] so she can head for [[Ahtohallan]].\n\n==Gallery==\n\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nFrozen2-animationscreencaps.com-5899.jpg\nFile:Frozen II - Did That snowman talk.jpg|Honeymaren, Ryder, and other Northuldra confused and shocked at the sight of Olaf\nFrozen2-animationscreencaps.com-6889.jpg\nFrozen - Newcomers.png\nWhereDidYouGetIt.jpg\nRyderRevealingScarfFact.jpg\nNorthuldraScarf.jpg\nFrozen II - Honeymaren, Ryder and Yelana.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Video games===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nWs-ryder.png\nCc-frozen-3.png\n</gallery>\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nFrozen2-honeymaren-ryder.png\nMagical Guide Ryder.jpg|Image of Ryder from The Magical Guide\nWelcomeHome.jpeg\nFile:Honeymaren and Ryder Concept Art.jpg|Concept art of Honeymaren and Ryder\nFile:Characters 3.jpeg\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Ryder is named after co-director [[Chris Buck]]\u2019s late son, who died shortly before the premiere of the original ''[[Frozen]]''.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n==External links==\n\n*{{Interwiki|https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/frozen/images/6/64/Favicon.ico|Frozen|Ryder Nattura|Frozen Wiki}}\n{{Frozen}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Ryder}}\n[[pt-br:Ryder Nattura]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Frozen characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Disney Magic Kingdoms characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Scandinavian characters]]"
