Her abduction to the underworld by the dark lord, Pluto, and return to her beloved mother was the ancient Greeks' way of explaining the turning of the seasons.\n\nIn ''[[Once Upon a Time]]'', she doesn't appear. However, her story and romantic relation with Hades are attribued to [[Theodora the Wicked Witch of the West|Zelena the Wicked Witch of the West]].\n\n==Gallery==\n===Concept Art===\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nPersephoneGOS.jpg\nPersephoneGOSConcept.jpg\nElvesAndImpsGOS.jpg\nGodess-of-spring1.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nPersephone (The Goddess of Spring) 01.png\nPersephone (The Goddess of Spring) 02.png\nPersephone (The Goddess of Spring) 03.png\nPersephone (The Goddess of Spring) 04.png\nPersephone (The Goddess of Spring) 05.png\nPersephone (The Goddess of Spring) 06.png\nPersephone (The Goddess of Spring) 07.png\nPersephone (The Goddess of Spring) 08.png\nPersephone (The Goddess of Spring) 09.png\nPersephone (The Goddess of Spring) 10.png\nPersephone (The Goddess of Spring) 11.png\nPersephone (The Goddess of Spring) 12.png\nPersephone (The Goddess of Spring) 13.png\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Silly Symphonies characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Greek Mythology]]\n[[Category:Greek characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Queens]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Goddesses]]\n[[Category:Olympian Gods]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]"
