She then tells Lewis who is about to leave that the Harringtons are here to talk to him to which she instructs him to look at the two while talking to them. Mildred then tells Lewis to show how special he is in inventing. Soon as Lewis leaves to talk to the Harringtons. After a failed conversation with the two due to Mr. Harrington's allergy to peanuts, Mildred comforts a sulking Lewis telling him she hasn't found the right couple for him to be adopted to which Lewis is upset about getting adopted to which she discusses with him about his mother. Lewis plans on finding his mother, but Mildred refuses to because she explains that no one knows about Lewis' mother to which Lewis thinks that he has known his mother in his memory. She then appears during \"[[Another Believer]]\" where Lewis is in a montage of him making the [[Memory Scanner]].\n\nSoon as Lewis finishes making the Memory Scanner, Mildred talks to Michael to wish her good luck during a game of baseball where he tells him that Lewis is up all night working on the Memory Scanner.
