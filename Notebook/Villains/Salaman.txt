He later showed fierceness where he points threatens [[Philip Swift]] in a plan to get the tears from the mermaid [[Syrena]] for the ritual. When Blackbeard was defeated for good, Salaman later joined [[Hector Barbossa]] to be part of his crew, alongside the surviving members of Blackbeard's crew.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides]]''===\nOn board the ''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]'', Salaman worked with the ship's crewmen working with a shanghaied [[Jack Sparrow]] who was dissatisfied with him sailing under [[Angelica]] and participated in Jack's mutiny. Salaman even helped Jack fight against the Gunner by throwing a net on him. Jack then nodded to him into rescuing [[Philip Swift]] who was captured by [[Blackbeard]]. Upon arriving at the mast, Salaman tells Philip is he is either with the pirates or against them, confusing Salaman and claiming that he is neither doing one of them, Salaman felt confused about what Philip said, believing that it is for Philip. Salaman and Jack later join the fight in which the battle was almost successful just as the crew notices Captain Blackbeard approaching the group. During the mutiny, Blackbeard hung all of the crewmen, including Salaman, to which he and the other crewmen later notice the Cook being punished by Blackbeard.\n\nIn a plan to to find a mermaid at [[Whitecap Bay]] and obtain her tears for the ritual, the crew manages to capture a surviving mermaid named \"[[Syrena]]\" after surviving a massive battle. Salaman and the rest of the crew continued Blackbeard's search for the [[Fountain of Youth]] to which he and the rest of the crew obtain a tear from Syrena for the ritual.\n\nArriving at the Fountain, Salaman breaks a piece of stalactite from the cavern, which almost crusaded him. As the crew arrives at the Fountain, [[Hector Barbossa]] and his crew approach Salaman and the rest of the crew, followed by a battle occurring at the Fountain between the British soldiers and Blackbeard's crew where Salaman fights against the British soldiers bravely until the [[Spaniard]] arrives to the destroy the Fountain. After Blackbeard dies, Salaman and the rest of the surviving members of Blackbeard's crew later join Barbossa and had the ''Revenge'' set sail for [[Tortuga]].\n\n==Trivia==\n*It is said that in [[Terry Rossio]]'s original script for ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales|Dead Men Tell No Tales]]'' that Salaman was present along with most of the crew of the ''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]'' in the story before being deleted in the final version.\n\n==External links==\n*[https://pirates.fandom.com/wiki/Salaman Salaman] on [https://pirates.fandom.com/wiki/ Pirates of the Caribbean Wiki].\n\n{{Pirates of the Caribbean}}\n[[Category:Pirates of the Caribbean characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Sailors]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]"
