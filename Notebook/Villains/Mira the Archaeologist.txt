A genuinely nice and very intelligent woman, her sunny disposition is nearly the exact polar opposite of [[Katie Dodd]]'s. When there's something to analyze, she does it immediately and precisely, as being a passionate archaeologist.\n\nMira enlists [[Baloo#TaleSpin|Baloo]] and [[Wildcat]] to help find a lost pyramid, in order to create a tourist attraction for her impoverished country. Despite having a calm nature, she can act loudly when trying to convince somebody. She is normally slow to anger, but not afraid to stand up and show some backbone when it really counts.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Despite her name being spelled \"Mira\", it is pronounced as \"Myra\" rather than \"Meera\".\n*She is frequently given the surname Foxworthy by the ''TaleSpin'' fandom, even though this name is never actually given in the episode and has no source for it.\n*She is identified as \"Mira the Archaeologist\" in the script for \"[[In Search of Ancient Blunders]]\".\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nMyra001.jpg\nMyra Foxworthy screengrab.jpg\nMyra035.jpg\nMyra056.jpg\nMyra065.jpg\nMyra104.jpg\nMyra111.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{TaleSpin}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Foxworthy, Myra}}\n[[Category:TaleSpin characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Foxes]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
