This may suggest a mark of leadership to all of the lieutenants in the [[Ten Rings]] hierarchy.\n*According to Jackson Norris, the Mandarin's origins claim him to be a warrior king who goes as far back in recorded history as the Middle Ages. This would imply the Mandarin is either immortal or it is a title given to every leader of the Ten Rings.\n*The Ten Rings terrorist group in the original ''Iron Man'' is a reference to the magic rings the Mandarin possesses in the comics.\n*[[Trevor Slattery]] and [[Aldrich Killian]] stole the Mandarin's identity and the identity of the Ten Rings.'' [[Marvel One-Shot: All Hail the King|All Hail the King]] '' reveals that the Mandarin and the Ten Rings are real, with the real Mandarin making his first on-screen appearance in'' [[Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings]] '' (the real Ten Rings having previously appeared in ''Iron Man'' and'' [[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'').\n*In the comics, Shang-Chi's father was {{WPS|Fu Manchu (Marvel Comics)|Fu Manchu}}. This was changed due to the racist connotations of the character, as well as legal red tape preventing Fu Manchu from being used.\n*In the comics the Ten Rings were worn on each of the Mandarin's fingers and each possessed their own special power. This was changed in the Shang-Chi film by producer Jonathan Schwartz to avoid any comparison or similarity to the [[Infinity Gauntlet]] as the [[Infinity Stones]] play a similar role. Instead they are worn on his wrists based on the Hung Gar Iron Rings as a reference to Chinese culture in order to re-enforce the image of the film as a martial arts film.<ref>[https://thedirect.com/article/shang-chi-avengers-infinity-stones-mcu-ten-rings-design-exclusive Shang-Chi Producer Confirms Avengers' Infinity Stones Influenced MCU's Ten Rings Design (Exclusive)]</ref>\n*It's unknown if the Mandarin was \"blipped\".\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nMandarin EMH cameo.png\nMandarin DWA.png\nShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings - EW Photography - Wenwu.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n{{Marvel Animated Universe}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mandarin, The}}\n[[Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Chinese characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Shang-Chi characters]]\n[[Category:Acquired characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Iron Man characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]"
