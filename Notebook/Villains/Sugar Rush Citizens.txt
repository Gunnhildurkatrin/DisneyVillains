"\n[[File:Sugar_rush_citizens.jpg|thumb|250px]]\nThe '''Sugar Rush Citizens''' are little candy people who live in the game ''[[Sugar Rush]]''. They are made of many different kinds of candy. Each candy is shown cheering for a specific racer.\n\n==Civilians==\n<tabber>Racers=\nThe racers are the main citizens of ''Sugar Rush'' and are all based on humans. Every night after the arcade is closed, they compete in the Random Roster Race to see the 9 racers that are racing the next day on the player board.\n\n*[[Taffyta Muttonfudge]]\n*[[Vanellope von Schweetz]]\n*[[Rancis Fluggerbutter]]\n*[[Candlehead]]\n*[[Gloyd Orangeboar]]\n*[[Snowanna Rainbeau]]\n*[[Crumbelina DiCaramello]]\n*[[Sugar Rush Racers|Minty Zaki]]\n*[[Sugar Rush Racers|\"The Swizz\" Malarkey]]\n*[[Sugar Rush Racers|Adorabeezle Winterpop]]\n*[[Sugar Rush Racers|Jubileena Bing-Bing]]\n*[[Sugar Rush Racers|Torvald Batterbutter]]\n*[[Sugar Rush Racers|Nougetsia Brumbelstain]]\n*[[Sugar Rush Racers|Citrusella Flugpucker]]\n*[[Sugar Rush Racers|Sticky Wipplesnit]]\n|-|Grand Stands=\nThe grand stands are giant candy boxes with a specific candy in them cheering for the racers.

The marshmallows appear to be parodies of Lakitus from the ''Super Mario'' series games, which are turtle-like enemies that wear goggles and ride in smiling clouds where they attack Mario/Luigi by dropping down Spinies, enemies resembling small turtles with spikes on their shells that could hurt Mario/Luigi if they try to jump on them; in the ''Mario Kart'' series games, Lakitus act as cameramen and racing referees holding the starting light and checkered flags, also in ''Mario Kart 7'' a red-shelled Lakitu (as opposed to a green shell) appears as an unlockable playable character.\n\n|-|Oreo Cookie Guards=\n[[File:Wreck-it-ralph-disneyscreencaps.com-4406.jpg.jpg|thumb|250px|The Oreo guards outside of King Candy's castle.]]\nThese are Oreo cookies who guard and work exclusively within the proximity of [[Sugar Rush Castle]]. They are a parody of the Winkies from ''The Wizard of Oz'' as they sing \"[[March of the Oreos]]\", a parody of the Winkie guards' chant.\n{{-}}\n\n|-|CLAW Officers=\n[[File:CLAW_wirdisney.jpg|thumb|250px|King Candy and the CLAW officers.]]\nAside from [[Wynnchel and Duncan]] the doughnut cops, other law enforcers in ''Sugar Rush'' include the CLAW officers (a parody of SWAT), which are all anthropomorphic bearclaw pastries.\n|-| Devil Dogs=\n[[File:DevilDogs.png|thumb|250px|Devil Dogs.]]\n''' The Devil Dogs''' are small\u00a0cookie sandwiches that act as guard dogs, and work as minions for [[Wynnchel and Duncan]].\n\nThey resemble hot dogs, but with devil's food cakes instead of buns and a white creamy filling instead of a sausage. The dogs also have a white creamy filling as spikes on their collars. [[King Candy]]\u00a0and his henchmen Wynnchel and Duncan set the dogs out to search for [[Wreck-It Ralph (character)|Ralph]] when he escapes from his castle. They seem to be eager to please Wynnchel and Duncan, running after Ralph at full speed after making his escape.\n</tabber>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery bordercolor=\"accent\" captionsize=\"medium\" bordersize=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\">\nTumblr md340yxSKu1r82zt0o6 1280.jpg|Concept art of various Sugar Rush citizens.\nCitizensConcept.jpg|Production art of residents fleeing Sugar Rush.\nSugarRushParents.jpg|Concept art of the racers' parents.\nSugar-Rush-Stands.jpg|A prototype model of the candy grandstands.\nSugar Rush Concept - Scrapped Characters.jpg|Scrapped and prototype Sugar Rush racers by Kevin Nelson.\nSugar rush karts.png|Scrapped karts and some karts that did appear in the final cut.\nSugarRushCitizens.jpg|Sugar Rush citizens by Lorelay Bove.\nSugarRushGrandstands.jpg|Racer grandstands by Brittney Lee.\nCitizens4.png|Cheering on the racers.\nCitizens3.png|\"Have some candy!\"\nCitizens2.png|Vanellope enters the random roster race.\nSugar Rush Citizens 1.png|The crowd panics.\nCitizens7.png|Adorabeezle's fans celebrate an 'A-La Mode!'\nCitizens5.png|Ralph has the citizens losing their heads.\nCitizens6.png|Candy chaos\nMarshmallow.png|One of the workers in charge of the scoreboard.\nWreck-it-ralph-disneyscreencaps com-9433.jpg|The citizens flee for their lives.\nCitizens8.png|The [[Cy-Bugs]] invade Sugar Rush.\nWreck-it-ralph-695.png|Panic ensues.\nSugar Rush town.jpg|The village.\nKing Candy and Sugar Rush citizens fleeing.jpg\nRacersScan5.jpg|The citizens with Vanellope in the Little Golden Book.\nVanellopeRacersScan1.jpg|The Sugar Rush citizens in the Little Golden Book.\nRacersScan1.jpg|The citizens cheer for the racers in the Big Golden Book.\nKingcandyisturbogolden.jpg\nSugarRushCitizens-WIR.png\nSugar Rush Citizens in Disney Infinity.png|Sugar Rush Citizens in [[Disney Infinity: 3.0 Edition|Disney Infinity 3.0]]\nDSA Sugar Rush.png|In [[Disney Sorcerer's Arena]]\nFile:Tumblr n3jiygdgj31r3jmn6o1 1280.png|Citizens and races re-entering the game.\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*The cat animal crackers shown during the scene where King Candy gives out free candy are the only citizens animated on the inside of their crackers (using traditional hand-drawn animation) rather than the outside.\n\n{{Wreck-It Ralph}}\n{{Disney Infinity}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Wreck-It Ralph characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Sugar Rush Racers]]\n[[Category:Foods]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Disney Infinity characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Crossy Road characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Sorcerer's Arena Characters]]"
