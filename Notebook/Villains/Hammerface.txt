'''Experiment 033''' and '''Hammerhead''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]]. He\u00a0is designed to hammer nails around Jumba's house. He was captured by [[Gantu]], but was rescued in \"[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]\".\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment 033 was the 33rd genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to drive nails around Jumba's house, but he will sometimes hammer living organisms as well. 033 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.\n\n033's pod eventually made its way to a junk shop, where it, along with [[Heat|609]], [[Thresher|544]], and [[Plasmoid|617]], was discovered, stolen, activated, and named Hammerface by [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] in \"[[Dupe (episode)|Dupe]]\".\n\nBack at [[Gantu's Ship|his ship]], Gantu trained and conditioned Hammerface, Thresher, Heat, and Plasmoid by using [[Reuben|Experiment 625]] for target practice, much to his indignity. The four henchmen experiments were then led by Gantu in an attack on the [[Lilo's House|Pelekais' house]], where their boss ordered them\u00a0to defeat and capture [[Stitch]] and his replicas after seeing that he had been split into four.\n\nHammerface engaged one of the clones in a duel. The clone rolled into a ball and slammed into Hammerface, knocking the latter toward\u00a0the wall, which he\u00a0clung to. He then jumped onto the\u00a0floor and ended the fight by slamming his hammer-like\u00a0head\u00a0on\u00a0the opposite end of the floorboard the clone was\u00a0on, catapulting him into Gantu's awaiting containment orb.\n\nAfter\u00a0capturing\u00a0Stitch and his duplicates, the five returned to Gantu's ship for a victory feast (courtesy of Reuben), but were interrupted by [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Pleakley]], and [[Dupe]]. After\u00a0Lilo tricked Gantu into using Dupe's cloning ability, Gantu used Dupe to clone Hammerface into a hundred replicas. However, as Hammerface's power was divided among them, they all became complete weaklings, and thus were easily defeated.\n\nPresumably after this, they were all sent to [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]] who was somehow able to re-merge\u00a0the weakling Hammerface clones into the original.\n\nIn \"[[The Asteroid]]\", Hammerface was one of the six experiments that Stitch convinced to come with him and Lilo to save Earth from an approaching asteroid. Along the journey, [[Sparky (Lilo & Stitch)|Sparky]]\u00a0teased Hammerface by shocking him, angering the latter. Later, the hammer-headed experiment started hitting [[Kixx]] on the head, only to be ordered otherwise by Pleakley (who referred to him as \"Hammerhead\" instead of \"Hammerface\").\n\nIn \"[[Remmy (episode)|Remmy]]\",\u00a0Hammerface was one of the experiments in Lilo's dream.\n\nIn \"[[Woops (episode)|Woops]]\", Hammerface\u00a0was sent back to Gantu\u00a0after [[Woops|Experiment 600]] caused mischief and nearly blew H\u00e4msterviel's cover to the\u00a0[[UGF Troopers|prison guards]].\n\nHammerface reappeared in \"[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]\", and was freed along with Gantu's other captive experiments by Lilo, Stitch, and several other experiments in a rescue mission.\n\n===''[[The Origin of Stitch]]''===\nHammerface was one of the experiments that were gliding on the screen, but he is 525 instead of 033.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nThe first 624 experiments, including Hammerface, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]] and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nHammerface participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]].\n\nThe Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.\n\n===''[[Stitch!]]''===\nHammerface made an appearance in Season 2\u00a0of the\u00a0''Stitch!'' anime along with [[Spike (Lilo & Stitch)|Spike]], [[Woody (Lilo & Stitch)|Woody]], [[Link]], and [[Babyfier]]. It is revealed that [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]] reverted these experiments to evil using a recording of [[Angel]]'s song, thus enabling them to wreak havoc on the [[Izayoi Island|island]].\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Hammerface is one of the\u00a0ten known experiments named by someone other than Lilo, the other\u00a0nine being [[Gigi]], [[Elastico]], [[Yaarp]], [[Heat]], [[Thresher]], [[Plasmoid]], [[Morpholomew]], [[Shrink]], and [[Leroy]].\n*Hammerface is Experiment 033. However, in ''[[Stitch! The Movie]]'', he is erroneously called 124, most likely due to Jumba's untidy\u00a0[[Jumba's Computer|database]].\n*In \"[[The Asteroid]]\", Pleakley referred to Hammerface as \"Hammerhead\". Presumably because his head is indeed shaped like a hammer.\n**Additionally, Hammerface was seen already activated in this episode, but because \"The Asteroid\" was out of chronological order, he wasn't officially activated until the episode \"[[Dupe (episode)|Dupe]]\" aired.\n*Even though we saw Hammerface in\u00a0[[Experiment Pods|pod]] form, he was technically activated off-screen.\n*In the English dub of the ''[[Stitch!]]'' anime episode \"Link-age\", [[Reuben]] states that Hammerface's favorite type of sandwich is ham on flatbread.\n**Additionally, his number is mistaken for 032, which belongs to [[Fibber]].\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
