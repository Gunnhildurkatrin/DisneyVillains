He is a young boy with dark-blond hair who is often seen making cameos in crowd shots, first appearing in \"[[Toy to the World]]\". He has also occasionally taken part in [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]] and [[Ferb Fletcher|Ferb]]'s big ideas. His most notable role was in the episode \"[[I Was a Middle Aged Robot]]\", in which he twice sees [[Perry the Platypus]], in his secret agent persona, coming out the [[Lawrence Fletcher]] robot's rear end. At the end of the episode, he comes upon Perry in his pet persona and notices that he looks familiar.\n\nPrior to [[2013]], Balthazar was known primarily as the '''Ballpit Kid''' by fans. This is due to a scene in the episode \"[[No More Bunny Business]]\", in which, during the \"[[X-Ray Eyes]]\" song sequence, Phineas and Ferb use their x-ray specs to find and retrieve Balthazar out of a ball pit that he got lost in. Balthazar's real name was eventually confirmed during season 4, with it being spoken onscreen in the episode \"[[Backyard Hodge Podge]]\". Notably, in \"[[Troy Story]]\", he officially states that \"Ballpit Kid\" is his nickname.\n\n==Appearances==\n* \"[[Toy to the World]]\"\n* \"[[Bowl-R-Ama Drama]]\"\n* \"[[Put That Putter Away]]\"\n* \"[[Out of Toon]]\"\n* \"[[Interview With a Platypus]]\"\n* \"[[Oh, There You Are, Perry]]\"\n* \"[[No More Bunny Business]]\"\n* \"[[Fireside Girl Jamboree]]\"\n* \"[[Finding Mary McGuffin]]\"\n* \"[[Just Passing Through]]\"\n* \"[[I Was a Middle Aged Robot]]\"\n* \"[[The Lizard Whisperer]]\"\n* \"[[Phineas and Ferb Summer Belongs to You!|Summer Belongs to You!]]\"\n* \"[[Run, Candace, Run]]\"\n* \"[[Phineas' Birthday Clip-O-Rama!]]\"\n* \"[[The Belly of the Beast]]\"\n* \"[[Magic Carpet Ride]]\"\n* \"[[Meatloaf Surprise]]\"\n* \"[[A Real Boy]]\"\n* ''[[Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension]]''\n* \"[[Quietest Day Ever]]\"\n* \"[[Backyard Hodge Podge]]\"\n* \"[[Great Balls of Water]]\"\n* \"[[Knot My Problem]]\"\n* \"[[Happy Birthday, Isabella]]\"\n* \"[[Love at First Byte]]\"\n* \"[[Troy Story]]\"\n* \"[[The Inator Method]]\"\n\n{{PF-Wiki}}\n{{Phineas and Ferb}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Horowitz, Balthazar}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Phineas and Ferb characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
