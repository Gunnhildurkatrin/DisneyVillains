He is good friends with [[Sofia the First (character)|Sofia]], [[Prince James]], [[w:c:sofia:Princess Maya|Princess Maya]], and [[Prince Khalid]]. He is also the younger brother of [[Princess Jun]]\u00a0and the Prince of [[Wei-Ling]].\n\n==Personality==\nUnlike his sister, Jin is more interested in doing something in the present than in talking about the past. Like his father, Jin is shown to love new things.\n\n==Role in the Series==\nJin made his debut in \"[[Tri-Kingdom Picnic]]\". He first appears when Sofia shows up for the Picnic Games. When Sofia's horseshoe for the Flying Horseshoe Toss starts to make her float away, Jin grabs her and brings her back down. Jin is wowed when Sofia gets a ringer despite it being her first time. Suddenly James starts to be both a sore winner and a sore loser. Like his friends and sister, Jin is annoyed to no end by this. Finally, he gets so fed up that he tells James \"If you want the Chalice so badly James, you can have it! We quit!\" Later James, who's been brought to his senses by Sofia, apologizes for how he acted and the games resume.\n\nJin's next major appearance is in \"[[Princesses to the Rescue!]]\" James and Jin find a map that leads to the Treasure of the [[Jade Jaguar]]. Unfortunately, when they get to the cave, they are ambushed by the Jade Jaguar, who chases them into a trap in which they get stuck. Their fathers, Roland and Quon, also get stuck when they fall into the trap. Fortunately, they are rescued by Sofia Amber and Jun.\n\nHis next major role is in \"[[The Bamboo Kite]]\". He first appears when Sofia arrives at the Imperial Palace. He informs Sofia that Jun has the summer sniffles. Sofia and Jin head to Wu-Chang, who tells them about Men-Saing and how it can be found on Mount Disham. Jin packs his backpack with all his favorite new gadgets. On the way, they meet [[Kai (Sofia the First)|Kai]], one of the magical talking pandas from Wei-Ling's North Forests. After they watch one of his dances, Kai helps them get to the Men-Saing faster with Bamboost. After Wu-Chang gets them high enough up the mountain, Jin gets them up the rest of the way with his grappling hook. Sofia helps them get back in time with an enlarged version of Wu-Chang's bamboo kite and one of Jin's new gadgets.\n\n==Trivia==\n*His name is just one vowel different than his sister's.\n*His name can either mean \"gold\" in Chinese, or \"precious\" in Korean.\n*Ironically he likes searching for treasure.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\">\nJunJin.jpg\nPrincess Maya Doesn't Like James Driven with Power.PNG\nThe Show Must Go On!
