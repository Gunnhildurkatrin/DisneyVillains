The club was also the successor to S.E.A. affiliates ''The Pillager's Brigade'', a group which Merriweather might have been a member of in the 1890s along with late S.E.A. member [[Harrison Hightower III]].  The club would have had to be founded prior to 1913 as one of its original members was former president, rough-rider and big-game hunter [[Theodore Roosevelt]] who was friends with Pleasure.  The other eldest known members of the group were English military officer [[Colonel Critchlow Sunchbench]] and the [[Museum of the Weird]] proprietress [[Madame Zarkov|Madame Vidalia Onionski Zarkov]], the latter of whom was a past contact of S.E.A. via way of [[Jason Chandler]].\n\nAt some point in time, the club's presidency was elected to be held by a woman named [[Pamelia Perkins]].  The Adventurers Club's official greeting was, \"Kungaloosh!\" which served many vocabulary functions.  Club-members [[Otis T. Wren]] and Pamelia Perkins along with possible member Sheila Griffin took to hosting a radio show called, \"Tales from the Adventurers Club\" to raise additional funds for the groups.  Colonel Sunchbench would work as the club's glee-master (in return for free gin-and-tonic) and would oversee the instructing of the club's official theme-song.  The lyrics to this theme-song were:\n\n\"''Marching Along We're Adventurers''\n\n''Singing the Song of Adventure's''\n\n''Up or Down, North, South East, or West''\n\n''An Adventurer's Life is Best''\".\n\nStarting on the [[December 31|New Year's Eve]] of [[1927]], the club also hosted the annual, \"Balderdash Cup\" event in which members competed to see who had the best adventuring story.  The first victor of the cup was none other than Merriweather Adam Pleasure though this is the only time he is known to have won the cup.  The [[1928]] cup was won by member [[Samantha Sterling]] while the [[1929]] cup was cancelled as a result of the Great Depression.  The [[1930]] cup was won by member Sutter Beswick while for the following six years it was won consecutively by aviator playboy [[Hathaway Browne]].\n\nThe club's headquarters were built in [[1932]] on Pleasure Island, property owned by Merriweather in [[Lake Buena Vista]], [[Florida]] which was supposedly enchanted by a deity/spirit known as the [[The Funmeister|Funmeister]]. The Adventurers Club's headquarters were designed by historic architects Sir Edwin Luytens, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, and Eliel Saarinen.  The headquarters held a great assortment of artifacts, each of which was personally mounted by club curator and member [[Fletcher Hodges|Prof. Fletcher Hodges]].  Notable artifacts included the living taxidermy head of a Mongolian Yakoose, living statue of the goddess Babylonia, desecrated statue of [[Zeus]] holding a fishing-rod, an organ haunted by club pianist, \"Fingers Zambezi\", the Flying Carpet of Abu Dhabi, and the tank of the genie ''Beezle''.\n\nThe New Year's Eve of [[1937]], the club threw an open house while it was was running out of money and at risk of losing their headquarters on Pleasure Island.  In addition to this, Fletcher Hodges slipped up and caused several members of the club to fail to attend their meeting.  Perkins and Wren garnered funds for the club by deputizing attendees of the open house to partake in their radio-show, raising the funds which they needed.  This same year, an Ohio man named [[Emil Bleehall|Emil Bleehall, Jr.]] joined the club and won the Balderdash Cup, breaking the winning-streak of Hathaway Browne.\n\nBy this time, the Adventurers Club was also closely affiliated by one [[Trader Sam]] who was a personal friend of the late-Teddy Roosevelt and several later members of the club.  Sam was an employee of the S.E.A. organization the [[Jungle Navigation Company]] and during the 1930s, the Adventurers Club assisted Trader Sam in opening up his JNC bar, ''Trader Sam's Enchanted Tiki Bar'' in the Polynesian isles.  Following the New Year's Eve of 1937, the Adventurers Club left many artifacts from their headquarters in the possession of Trader Sam to help decorate his bar and sometimes simply to safe-keep when they were out adventuring.\n\nIn [[1944]], a group of corrupt land-developers attempted to claim Pleasure Island and turn it into an upper-class resort and spa.  Through bribes, these developers manipulated the law so that they would be able to take control of Pleasure Island in [[1945]].  These plans were however foiled by Hurricane Charlotte in 1944, a hurricane which devastated the island and left it as an uninhabitable marshland.  During the hurricane, Merriweather lead an evacuation of the island but was presumed dead afterwards though several other members of the group seemingly survived the affair.  Pleasure Island however was seemingly completely abandoned for the next several decades.\n\nOne of the new bases for the Adventurers Club became an airline hangar constructed in [[1948]] by S.E.A. member [[Jock Lindsey]] at 1138 Seaton Avenue in the sleepy town of [[Disney Springs (town)|Disney Springs]], Florida.  In addition to being a S.E.A. member, Jock Lindsey was the aviator to renowned archaeologist and adventurer [[Indiana Jones]] and stashed several artifacts from his adventures with Jones in the hangar bar.  In suit of this, Jock would also keep objects from the Adventurers Club such as the head of the goddess Babylonia in his hangar.  In [[1955]], the Adventurers Club assisted Jock in transforming this into, \"Jock Lindsey's Hangar Bar\", a bar where they frequently dined along with historic aviators such as Pancho Barnes, Howard Hughes and Charles Lindbergh along with characters such as [[Marion Ravenwood]], [[Sallah|Sallah Mohammed Faisel el-Kahir]] and [[Howard Stark]].\n\n== Members ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Merriweather Adam Illustration.jpg|[[Merriweather Adam Pleasure]]\nFile:RooseveltColor.jpeg|[[Theodore Roosevelt|Theodore \"Teddy\" Roosevelt]]\nFile:MadameZarkov.jpg|[[Madame Zarkov|Madame Vidalia Onionski Zarkov]]\nFile:Colonel WDW.jpg|[[Colonel Critchlow Sunchbench]]\nFile:Pamelia Perkins Costume Design.jpg|[[Pamelia Perkins]]\nFile:Samantha Sterling Portrait.webp|[[Samantha Sterling]]\nFile:Hathaway Browne.webp|[[Hathaway Browne]]\nFile:Otis T Wren.webp|[[Otis T.
