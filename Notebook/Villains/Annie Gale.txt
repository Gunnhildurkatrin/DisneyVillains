Nonetheless, she tells him that she knows he is capable of both</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">\u00a0goodness and the</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">\u00a0greatness he has always dreamed of, he must only embrace it.</span>\n\nAnnie<span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">\u00a0later marries John and</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">\u00a0becomes the mother of [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]].
