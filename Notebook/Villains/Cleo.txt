She appears to be very affectionate, specifically toward Geppetto and Figaro (who seems to hold a mild dislike toward her). When asked by Geppetto whether or not the name \"Pinocchio\" sounds any good for his latest puppet creation, Cleo shows her distaste, but the name goes through, anyway. Later on, when [[Pinocchio (character)|Pinocchio]] is given life, he is sent off to school along with the other children. Excited to have a family, Geppetto sets up a delicious dinner, including a small piece of cake for Cleo. Unfortunately, Pinocchio does not return, resulting in Cleo, Geppetto, and Figaro heading out to find them. The trio ends up in the belly of [[Monstro]] the Whale, and eventually, give up any hope of escape. As such, Cleo begins to build her own tombstones, knowing she will perish, along with her loved ones, should they not escape or manage to eat. Surprisingly, Pinocchio arrives and concocts a way to free them. The plan succeeds but results in Pinocchio's demise. Geppetto, Cleo, and the others return to their village home and mourn the death of the little wooden boy, only to find his act of bravery granted his revival (via the Blue Fairy). Once this realization dons upon Cleo and the others, a celebration is held.\n\n===''[[Figaro and Cleo]]''===\nCleo played a role in the short under the care of a woman by the name of [[Mammy Two Shoes|Aunt Delilah]] (Mammy Two Shoes).

In \"[[The Mouse Who Came to Dinner]]\", she makes a cameo sitting with Geppetto, Pinocchio, and Figaro clapping after the cartoon.\n\nCleo makes a cameo on the last page of issue #7 of the ''Darkwing Duck'' comic book, along with [[Sebastian]] and [[Dory]], reacting in shock to the return of the monstrous Paddywhack.\n\n==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]]==\nCleo appears as an Audio-Animatronic on ''[[Pinocchio's Daring Journey]]'' who pops up and down from her fishbowl in Geppetto's bedroom located in the Pinocchio Village Workshop.
