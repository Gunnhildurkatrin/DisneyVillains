They are a group of green goblins living in Goblin Town.\n\n==Background==\nAccording to Xandra, it is said that the original Three Caballeros arrived and sealed the goblins away to prevent a war from occurring across Earth, leaving the goblins without a king. Later when [[Baron Von Sheldgoose]] arrives, he temporarily serves as their ruler and sends the Caballeros to Goblin Jail, much to his evil plans. Later when Sheldgoose summons the goblins' ultimate weapon, the Baydoodior, it is found out that Sheldgoose betrayed the goblins for summoning a very destructive weapon. After defeating the Baydoodior with peace and harmony, the goblins then celebrate their victory with [[King Vomit]] crowned as their new king.\n\n==Role in the series==\nIn \"[[Stonehenge Your Bets]]\", goblin soldiers arrive and surround [[Panchito Pistoles|Panchito]], [[Jos\u00e9 Carioca|Jos\u00e9]], and [[Donald Duck|Donald]] where they are taken to a lair where Sheldgoose becomes their ruler. It is then known that the goblins want a war against the Caballeros as [[Lord Felldrake Sheldgoose|Felldrake]] leads the goblins to take war against Earth, much to his evil plans. [[King Vomit|Worm]], one of the goblins, approaches Felldrake and gives him the atlas to which he grabs it from Vlorp, a goblin bodyguard as [[Xandra]] tries to grab the atlas but fails as Felldrake tasks Worm to take Xandra away while tasking the goblins to send the Caballeros to Goblin Jail. Taken to the court, the Goblin Judge sings to the Caballeros to know if they are guilty or not to which Jos\u00e9 and Panchito declare themselves not to be guilty, to which the Goblin Jury sing to them that they find the defendants guilty as Worm sends the Caballeros to Goblin Jail as the goblin prisoners sing together about the miserable lives in jail.\n\nWith the Caballeros in prison, the Jailer tells Worm to sort the stuff out with the Caballeros in their cell. Instead of listening to him, Worm ends up picking up Donald's mirror where he talks to Daisy's nieces [[April, May, and June]] where they task him to take the nieces to see Donald. Meanwhile, Felldrake tells the goblins to give him their ultimate weapon to which a goblin soldier tells him to try other weapons such as the Flaming Catabog, the Thunder Screw, or a hamster instead to which Felldrake denies. Felldrake demands the goblins to give him their ultimate weapon, the Baydoodior, the most destructive monster the goblins have ever seen as Sheldgoose plans to avoid using it. Before leaving, Felldrake asks the goblins to know where the ultimate weapon is at to which they tell Felldrake and his descendant that it is located at a hidden area where it is sealed inside a chest. Back at Goblin Jail, the goblin prisoners discuss with each other in a plan to escape prison to which as the Jailer arrives, he silences them and upon seeing the key, the Caballeros and the prisoners discuss with each other and the Jailer arrives. He then tells the Caballeros that this is suspicious behavior to which Donald, Jos\u00e9, and Panchito get the key from the Jailer and lock him up in the cell, as he becomes worried that the Caballeros have escaped just as Worm arrives at the spot Donald would be at only to find the Jailer instead.\n\nAfter Sheldgoose, Felldrake, and Leopold find a scroll giving instructions to summon the War Beast, Baydoodior, Sheldgoose uses the scroll to summon it, much to the other goblins' shock as the Baydoodior starts causing destruction across Goblin Town, much to Felldrake's plans as this plan also breaks Felldrake's promise to the goblins. As the goblins see the Baydoodior destroying Goblin Town, they charge against the Baydoodior in a plan to fight back as it is found out that Felldrake betrayed the goblins, as the Caballeros go to the spot to find the golden atlas and rescue Xandra and after rescuing her, Xandra explains to the Caballeros that the Baydoodior's weakness is its heart and is the only way to destroy the monster as Xandra and the Caballeros plan to face the monster.\n\nThe goblin soldiers later strike at the War Beast but their arrows and weapons are ineffective as the War Beast absorbs the weapons without harming it as it is found out that the War Beast can detect various sorts of aggression such as rebellious fighting and arguments. Later when Jos\u00e9 and Panchito plan to \"hurt\" Donald's feelings, the goblins watch the argument between the Caballeros and Xandra as they react to their apologies, followed by Sheldgoose and his allies apologizing to each other while Worm calls the other goblins for a group hug. After Donald puts everyone else in harmony, the War Beast gets destroyed peacefully.\n\nAfter the Baydoodior explodes, Worm congratulates the Caballeros for saving Goblin Town as the Jailer apologizes to the Caballeros, clearing out their bad reputation as he praises the three for saving the kingdom. Worm then renames himself \"Vomit\" as he suddenly becomes the new Goblin King. As Vomit is crowned as the new king, the goblins celebrate the coronation of King Vomit as well as their victory as they praise the Caballeros and Xandra for saving their kingdom. \n\nIn \"[[Sheldgoose Square Dance]]\", the Goblins are summoned via zoom point during the battle where they fight against the Lava Lizards blocking the Caballeros' path while on their way to the Summoning Chamber. Xandra plans to counter this attack by summoning the goblins from Goblin Town to block the Lava Lizards from approaching. The zoom point not only summons the goblins but also King Vomit riding on a giant green cat used as a catapult where Vomit launches Xandra and the Caballeros to get past the Lava Lizards while the other goblins begin using their shields to repel the incoming Lava Lizards. Later, when Felldrake prepares for a new age of darkness, all the reinforcements that were summoned during the final battle are sent back to their respective homes, where the goblins, alongside their leader, are sent back to Goblin Town. Even after the final battle ended, it is likely that the goblins still remain at Goblin Town with Vomit still serving his duty as king.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The Goblin Judge is prominently featured in the show's opening theme.\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Goblins}}\n{{Saludos Amigos/The Three Caballeros}}\n[[Category:The Three Caballeros characters]]\n[[Category:Goblins]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
