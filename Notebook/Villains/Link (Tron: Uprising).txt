[[General Tesler]]\u00a0offers a [[Light Speedster]] in return for the renegade. Link, under the urging of Pavel, turns Hopper in. While driving his speedster, the renegade surprises him from the back seat. When he is scheduled to appear for turning in \"the renegade\", [[Beck]]\u00a0drives in on the Speedster. In \"[[Grounded]]\", [[Able]]\u00a0leaves\u00a0Link to watch [[Beck]]\u00a0in the shop but he allows his charge to leave, believing he is going to see the renegade turn himself in. He\u00a0says he has seen Tron in action. In \"[[We Both Know How This Ends]]\", while repairing one of Tesler's tanks that Beck sabotaged, it misfires and repeatedly fires on a chopper. Through his help, Mara fixes the fail-safe in the tanks.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Tron}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Link}}\n[[Category:Tron characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Programs]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tron: Uprising characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Mechanics]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]"
