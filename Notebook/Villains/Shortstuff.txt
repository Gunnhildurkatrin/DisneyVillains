'''Experiment 297''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]]. He\u00a0is designed to sabotage mechanical devices; specifically, he is naturally drawn to electrical machinery, which he then shorts out to create utter chaos. Due to him being accidentally enlarged, his one true place is as an amusement park ride.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nShortstuff is shown to be short-tempered, reckless and clever. Armed with four pincers, he is not exactly afraid to take on bigger opponents. He also seems to be quite tolerant of his enormous size after he was accidentally enlarged. As a giant, he was still able to\u00a0wreak havoc and overpower an equally giant [[Stitch]] in battle. When Shortstuff was tamed and became a carnival ride after his defeat, he didn't seem to mind at all.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nShortstuff is a small, red-orange crab-like experiment with four pincer-like claws, four spindle legs, dark blue eyes, a thin mouth with a turquoise tongue, and two small antennae on his head. Originally the size of a crab, he\u00a0was accidentally enlarged to twice the size of a house.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nShortstuff can sabotage machinery by entering and then cutting the mechanism's\u00a0electrical wiring using his claws, thus short-circuiting the appliance. He is also able to swivel at the waist more than 360 degrees. At his giant size, Shortstuff could overpower an equally giant [[Stitch]] in battle.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment 297 was the 297th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. Hamsterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to sabotage mechanical devices.\u00a0297 and the other first 625 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai, with 297's pod landing in a sewage pipe.\n\n[[Stitch]] was too short to participate in any of the carnival rides, so\u00a0[[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]]\u00a0tried to treat him to some lemonade instead. However, when the vendor offended Stitch about his\u00a0size, the latter\u00a0broke the vendor's lemonade cart. When lemonade from the broken\u00a0cart trickled into the\u00a0pipe, it touched 297's pod, activating the experiment.\n\n[[Captain Gantu|Gantu]], who was at the amusement park with [[Reuben|Experiment 625]], criticized the carnival games, whereas Reuben was having fun winning prizes and later attempted to eat a colossal submarine sandwich, but Gantu thwarted him. Gantu suddenly saw 297 and grabbed him, but the latter was able to escape by simply pinching Gantu.\n\nWhile 297 likely began his rampage, Stitch, who wanted to be bigger than his normal size, rummaged through [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]]'s devices. Since Jumba was away at a convention,\u00a0Lilo allowed [[Pleakley]] to enlarge Stitch with Jumba's [[Protoplasmic Growth Ray|growth ray]].\n\nUnfortunately, during Stitch's growth process, Gantu came to the [[Lilo's House|Pelekais' house]] looking for 297, whom Lilo lied about capturing. Gantu then saw a humongous Stitch towering over him after he compared his vast size to Lilo's. When she explained what happened and threatened to make Stitch even bigger, Gantu was forced to retreat.\n\nLater, 297 had proceeded to sabotage every ride at the amusement park before being chased by Lilo and Stitch, the latter having great difficulty due to his enormous size that made him unbalanced. 297 was then captured in a containment orb and taken back to the house, where Lilo named him Shortstuff (because he likes to short out stuff), whose presence\u00a0astonished Pleakley.\n\nWhile Stitch was asleep, Lilo convinced Pleakley to shrink him back to his original size. Unfortunately, Shortstuff was able to use his claws to escape containment, and attempted to sabotage Jumba's growth ray. However, in the process, the ray enlarged Shortstuff into a behemoth just as he fled outside. Stitch then requested to be enlarged into an equal behemoth so he could take on Shortstuff.\n\nMeanwhile, Shortstuff resumed his rampage at the carnival until he soon engaged the gigantic Stitch in battle. At first, Shortstuff was able to easily overpower Stitch, but after Jumba arrived and shrunk Stitch back to his normal, functional size with the shrink ray, the latter easily defeated Shortstuff, who was restrained with ropes.\n\nShortstuff's size was never reverted, and as a result, he found a one true place as an amusement park ride,\u00a0which Lilo and Stitch got to try out.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nThe first 624 experiments, including Shortstuff, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium\u00a0to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]] and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nShortstuff participated in the following battle between the experiments and the\u00a0[[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]] by swatting attacking Leroys with his huge claws.\n\nHowever, the Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.\n\n===''[[Stitch!]]''===\nShortstuff made a cameo appearance in the ''[[Stitch!]]'' anime as an image on a computer screen. [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]] was going to unleash him on the [[Izayoi Island|island]], but [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] somehow confused Shortstuff's number (297) with [[Wishy-Washy]]'s number (267) and accidentally sent the latter instead.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink|Shortstuff/Gallery}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Shortstuff is one of the rare experiments to not have black eyes like most experiments, having dark blue eyes instead.\n*Shortstuff, along with\u00a0[[Nosox]],\u00a0[[Richter]],\u00a0Butter,\u00a0[[Splodyhead]],\u00a0[[Gigi]], [[Tank (Lilo & Stitch)|Tank]], [[Yang]], [[Spike (Lilo & Stitch)|Spike]], [[Phoon]], and one unconfirmed experiment, are the only known experiments that are primarily quadrupeds.\n*Shortstuff's manner of defeat is very similar to Part I of ''{{WikipediaLink|Gulliver's Travels}}''.\n*Shortstuff's\u00a0[[Experiment Pods|pod]] color is green.\n*Oddly, when Shortstuff's image is reflected off of Stitch's eyes in ''[[The Origin of Stitch]]'', he is facing directly at the screen instead of to his right.\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Giants]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Crustaceans]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
