More specifically, he is found in the restaurant [[Cosmic Ray's Starlight Cafe]] in [[Magic Kingdom]].\n\n== Background ==\nSonny Eclipse is a Zorkie musician from the city of Yew Nork on the planet Zork, where life primarily lived underground to avoid the methane clouds on the surface. The entertainment capital of his planet, Sonny's Yew Nork upbringing lead him into the music business and he began touring around the galaxy.\n\nAfter he lost his backup singers during a gig on [[Mars]], he met the invisible Space Angels who have accompanied him ever since. He then found a nice long-term gig to serve as the in-house musician at the Starlight Lounge in Cosmic Ray's Starlight Cafe's first Earth franchise restaurant in [[Tomorrowland (Magic Kingdom)|Tomorrowland]].\n\nSonny has a relaxed comical demeanor, dishing out puns between his tracks, and a romantic side, with songs celebrating the beauty of the Earth and a love song for his six-eyed girlfriend.\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n=== Cosmic Ray's Starlight Cafe ===\nSonny provides jazz music for the guests in the Starlight Lounge on his Amazing Astro-Organ while they eat, with backing vocals provided by the Space Angels, a group of invisible alien singers.
