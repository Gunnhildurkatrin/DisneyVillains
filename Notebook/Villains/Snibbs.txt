He ended up injuring himself, so Sir Reginald let him take the day off.\n\n===Personality===\nSnibbs is disapproving of anyone he deems lower than himself, initally refusing to allow [[Goofy|Sherlock Goof]] into [[Mayor Baba|Sir Reginald's]] home because he didn't think he was a real ratcatcher (probably due to Sherlock's goofy behavior). He tends to exhibit patronizing behavior and acts suavely.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nSnibbs is tall, skinny anthropomorphic dog with black hair. He wears a black tuxedo.\n\n===Role in the series===\nHe only appears in the episode, \"[[Sherlock Goof]]\". The epynomous main character ends up letting himself into [[Mayor Baba|Sir Reginald's]] lodging after Snibbs injures himself.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Snibbs' voice actor Rob Paulsen uses the exact same voice for other French characters that appear in Goof Troop.\n\n{{Goof Troop}}\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Goof Troop characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Servants]] \n[[Category:French characters]]\n[[Category:Historical characters]]\n[[Category:French people]]"
