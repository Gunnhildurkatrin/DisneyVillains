She is the chief of the [[Tail]] in [[Kumandra]].\n==Background==\n===Physical Appearances===\nThe Tail Chief is an Southeast-Asian woman who wears the yellow color scheme clothing of her Kumandra tribe, Tail.\n\n=== Personality ===\nThe Tail Chief (like all the other clan leaders), while not shown much, was an easily distrusting woman who did not hesitate to speak her mind out in an argument regarding whether or not Heart Land tried to rob them. She appeared to be slightly immature, as she spoke in a less-than-regal voice when she insulted Benja. She also appeared to be greedy to the point of foolishness, since it was her greed to keep the Dragon Gem piece to herself that caused her to trap herself within in her own home, less she fall victim to her own traps.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Raya and the Last Dragon]]''===\nThe Tail Chief first appears when she and some of her tribe members attend the gathering of all of the tribe members of Kumandra at [[Heart (Raya and the Last Dragon)|Heart]], which [[Chief Benja]] hopes will make the Tribes be unified. At first, everything goes well, but when the Princess of the [[Fang (Raya and the Last Dragon)|Fang]] Tribe, [[Namaari]] tries to steal the gem and it soon leads to the gem breaking, resurrecting the [[Druun]] and The Tail Chief takes a piece back to her land where she became paranoid with anyone who tries to take it, so she sets booby-traps around her throne to throw people off, but she ends up being forced to live on the throne for the rest of her days due to her most likely setting off the traps if she leaves her throne.\n\nSix years later, the Princess of the Heart Tribe, [[Raya]] and the dragon [[Sisu]], who once used the gem to banish the Druun, arrive to collect the gem piece from the Tail Chief's corpse, which turns Sisu into a human. They are soon assaulted by Namaari and some soldiers from Fang, who are looking for the Gem pieces themselves.\n\n==Trivia==\n\n* She is the only chief from the beginning of the movie who dies instead of getting petrified by the Druun.\n{{Raya and the Last Dragon}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Raya and the Last Dragon characters]]"
