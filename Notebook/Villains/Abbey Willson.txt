However, there is no matter how greatly she wishes to be as cool as\u00a0Sierra, she always hangs by Riley and Tasumi's side. She makes her first appearance in \"[[The Jerky Girls]]\" and her last appearance in \"[[R2: A Tale of Two Rileys|A Tale of Two Rileys]]\". She is Riley's other best friend. Even though she dislikes the popular girls such as Sierra, she is seen wanting to be a part of them so bad, and has a habit of telling Sierra she is cool, even though she does not mean to. It also seems that her parents are rich. For some reasons, she can be hypocritical. She has a younger sister named [[Tiffany Willson|Tiffany]] who dated [[Todd Daring|Todd]] (Riley's brother) in the episode \"[[A Little Tiff]]\".\n\n==Clothing==\nAbbey's usual outfit is consisted of a pink midriff top and multicolored-striped pants, blue flats, and a blue headband.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\n\nRiley with Tasumi and Abbey.jpg\nField Trippin (2).jpg\nLate Night with Todd and Riley (3).jpg|Abbey and Tasumi\nLate Night with Todd and Riley (4).jpg\nLate Night with Todd and Riley (5).jpg\nLate Night with Todd and Riley (17).jpg\nLate Night with Todd and Riley (21).jpg\nAbbey looks at Fashion Guru Tim Gunn.PNG|Abbey sees a fashion guru Tim Gunn\nTiffany Replacements.jpg\n\n</gallery>\n==References==\n{{The Replacements}}{{DEFAULTSORT:Willson, Abbey}}\n[[Category:The Replacements characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:African American characters]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
