She is [[Jasmine|Princess Jasmine]]'s loyal handmaiden, confidante, and childhood friend. As Jasmine's handmaiden and the friend she confides in, Dalia is funny, sassy and carefree by nature. While she lives among the people of [[Agrabah]], she spends most of her time at the palace and keeps close tabs on the princess. She also serves as the [[Genie]]'s love interest.\n\n==Role in the [[Aladdin (2019 film)|film]]==\nThe movie opens with a Mariner ([[Genie]]) and his wife (Dalia) telling their children the story of [[Aladdin (character)|Aladdin]].\n\nOne day, Aladdin rescues a young woman from the palace guards. Although she claims to be Dalia, handmaiden to Princess Jasmine of Agrabah, she is later revealed to be Jasmine herself when another suitor for the princess, [[Prince Anders]], arrives.\n\nWhen Aladdin takes Jasmine on a ride on the [[Magic Carpet|magic carpet]], the Genie goes out with Dalia.\n\nWhen [[Jafar]] summons the Genie, she was stunned by this along with everyone surprised of his true self. Then after Jafar wishes to become Sultan and the world's most powerful sorcerer, and exiling Aladdin to a frozen wasteland, he threatens to kill Dalia and the Sultan unless Jasmine agrees to marry him.\n\nWith Agrabah returned to normal after Jafar's defeat, the Genie (now human) and Dalia leave to explore the world while Aladdin and Jasmine start their new life together. They are revealed to be the Mariner and the wife from the opening of the movie.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* She is the only main character in the film to be a brand-new character and not to have originated in the previous animated Aladdin continuity.\n** Screenwriter [[Linda Woolverton]] initially planned a similar character to originate in the original ''Aladdin'' movie as Jasmine's unnamed handmaiden, but she was eventually scrapped and has been replaced by Jasmine's pet tiger [[Rajah]].\n* She has similar roles with [[Aneesa]] as both of them assist Princess Jasmine with her daily activities and give her some advice.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nAladdin 2019 photography 22.jpg\nAladdin 2019 photography 20.jpg\nAladdin 2019 photography 15.jpg\nAladdin 2019 photography 35.jpg\nAladdin 2019 promotional still 4.jpg\nAladdin 2019 Banner.jpeg\nAladdin 2019 (25).png\nAladdin 2019 (46).png\nAladdin 2019 (102).png\nAladdin 2019 (66).png\nAladdin 2019 (135).png\nAladdin 2019 (124).png\nAladdin 2019 (134).png\ngenie&dalia.jpg|Dalia with Genie\n</gallery>\n\n{{Aladdin}}\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Aladdin characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Character stubs]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Middle Eastern characters]]\n[[Category:Servants]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in remakes]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Characters who narrate the story]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]"
