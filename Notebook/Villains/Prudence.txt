Prudence was tasked by [[The King (Cinderella)|the King]] to teach [[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]] how to act like a proper princess while he and [[Prince Charming]] were away. When she attempted to wake Cinderella, she was instead greeted by her pet dog [[Bruno (Cinderella)|Bruno]]. She searched the castle, eventually finding Cinderella in the kitchen, dressed like a servant, making her own breakfast. Taken aback, she soon introduced herself as well as Cinderella's other ladies-in-waiting, [[Beatrice and Daphne]].\n\nShe then spent the entire day trying to teach Cinderella how to act like a princess while planning the royal banquet. Many of the traditions didn't make sense, especially the choice of napkin colors. After being unable to do things the way Prudence instructed, Cinderella decided to do things her own way, leaving Prudence constantly saying \"It simply isn't done!\"; [[Jaq and Gus|Jaq]] made fun of her, singing it as he danced with [[Jaq and Gus|Gus]]. She eventually asserted to Prudence that she knew her changes were big, but that she had to try doing things her own way. Prudence could only remark that she hoped Cinderella knew what she was doing.\n\nCome the evening of the royal banquet, Prudence was shocked but relieved to find the King liked the changes Cinderella had made. When she received the thanks, Prudence corrected the King, telling him Cinderella was the one to thank. She then had no further problems with Cinderella, as she was now confident enough to trust her judgment over the outdated traditions.\n\nAlthough, Prudence is absent in the other two stories, she does make a cameo appearance at the end of the film when [[Beatrice and Daphne|Daphne]] drops a pie on [[Pom-Pom]].\n\n===''[[Cinderella III: A Twist in Time]]''===\nPrudence returns to a smaller role as a minor antagonist than in the second film. When [[Lady Tremaine]] reversed time in ''A Twist in Time'', Prudence and Cinderella met for the first time in this timeline when Cinderella claimed to be a royal mouse-catcher in order to sneak into the palace. Believing her, Prudence takes Cinderella to the cellar to make sure there are no mice in the cellar. Prudence does not appear again throughout the remainder of the film.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Her name is a pun based on her behavior.\n*She is shown to be fond of prunes.\n*In French, her name means Caution.\n*In ''[[Cinderella III: A Twist in Time|A Twist in Time]]'', Prudence does not wear a tiara, but she wears a tiara in ''[[Cinderella II: Dreams Come True|Dreams Come True]]''.\n*In ''A Twist in Time'', Prudence claims she had been working at the palace for thirty years.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n{{Cinderella}}\n[[pl:Prudencja]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Servants]]\n[[Category:Cinderella characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:European characters]]"
