They began singing in Public School 821 in Clint, Texas, in Miss Grizzly\u2019s class. From there they appeared five weeks running on Major Bear\u2019s Amateur Hour and were booked into Walt Disney World. Backstage they study their lessons (all the cast helps them with their homework, but they get good grades, anyway). In their spare time they are all knitting a scarf for Big Albert, which they hope to have finished for Christmas\u2014three years from now!''\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===[[Country Bear Jamboree]]===\nThe Sun Bonnets are part of this revue show.\n\n===Disney Springs Christmas Tree Trail===\nPosters for, \"Bunny, Bubbles, and Beulah's Beautiful Bonnets\" are hung along this trail in the fictitious town of Disney Springs.
