It is believed by some that if, on Hoohaw Hoo Eve, you turn around three times, make Ice Moose antlers, go \"honk honk honk\" and then make a wish on the star of Hoohaw Hoo, then Old Tim and his Sugarplum Ferrets (the equivalents of Santa's reindeer) will grant it. In \"[[The Ice Moose]]\", PB&J and the others put on a pageant about Old Tim. [[Peanut Otter|Peanut]], [[Baby Butter Otter|Butter]], [[Jelly Otter|Jelly]] and most of their friends believe that Old Tim is real, though [[Flick Duck|Flick]], disappointed at not receiving the flashy presents he wanted, has stopped believing (if he ever truly believed at all). Flick's disbelief is tested when he meets a young mouse who wishes on the Ice Moose to fly. He receives a visit from Old Tim in a dream. Additionally, at the end of \"The Ice Moose\", Old Tim and his Sugarplum Ferrets are shown driving off in a sleighboat. Tim exclaims \"Happy Hoohaw to all and to all a hawhoo!\" in a nod to the final line from the classic Christmas poem \"Twas the Night Before Christmas\" (or \"A Visit from Saint Nicholas\"). Butter refers to him as \"Moo-Moo\".\n\n\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nicemoose.PNG\n</gallery>\n\n{{PB&J Otter}}\n[[Category:PB&J Otter characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Playhouse Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Moose]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Holiday Figures]]"
