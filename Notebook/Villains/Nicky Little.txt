She is the intellectual best friend of [[Pepper Ann Pearson]] and [[Milo Kamalani]] and attends [[Hazelnut Middle School]] with them.\n\n==Background==\nNicky Little is a smart girl who lives with her parents and strives to be the best intellectually. She acts as Pepper Ann's voice of reason and tries to get through to her whenever she has an outlandish plan. A running gag is that she will try to instill the lesson into Pepper Ann, only for her to turn around and try to teach it to Nikki. She cares very much for her friend and tries to make sure she does not hurt herself.\n\nIn \"[[The Finale]]\", it is established that in the series' version of [[2013]], Nicky grows up to become a successful reporter and is supposedly in a relationship with someone named Kevin.\n\n===Personality===\nNicky is considered a perfectionist and usually keeps to the straight and narrow. Even though she talks with a very shy low voice, she will usually be more confrontational and upfront about her opinions. She is much more adapt at handling situations than her friends and clearly has a more mature outlook on life. It is implied at various points that she is trying to mold Pepper Ann and Milo into perfect adults, but this has a tendency to backfire on her. Nicky hates to be viewed as a nice girl and at one point tried to act bad, though ironically she was really bad at that. Nevertheless, Nicky maintains a very positive disposition and is more likely to solve problems then cause them.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nNicky is a tall slender Caucasian girl with long blonde hair. One of her bangs is always covering one of her eyes and her ears stick out like horns. She wears a long sleeved whiteish-blue sweater and red skirt while an extra dark blue sweater is tied around her waist. She wears brown dress shoes and white socks. \n\n==Trivia==\n*Nicky's hairstyle seem to cover one side of her eyes whenever she turns her head.\n*She, along with her sister [[Becky Little|Becky]], has a fear of swans.\n*In \"[[Guess Who's Coming to the Theater]]\" Nicky stated that she has not eaten meat for 6 years meaning that she ate meat at the age of 6 and under.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nYou Oughta Be In Musicals.JPG\nQuiz Bowl.JPG\nNicky-.jpg\nNicky-1.png\nVlcsnap-2012-05-03-04h00m11s185.jpg\nPepper Ann- 'Considering Constance' 3495.jpg\nSnot Your Mother's Music.jpg\nTessa Less Vanessa.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Pepper Ann}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Little, Nicky}}\n[[Category:Pepper Ann characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]"
