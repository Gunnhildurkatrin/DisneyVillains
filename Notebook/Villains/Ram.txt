He resembles his user, Roy Kleinberg.\n\n==History==\nRam was a program first seen in a pit cell inside the Game Grid, where programs resistant to the [[MCP]]'s rules were forced to participate in gladiatorial games, in which the losers are destroyed. He was a close friend of [[Tron (character)|Tron]] and [[Crom]]. Before being appropriated by the MCP, Ram had been an actuarial program for an unnamed insurance company; he had really enjoyed helping people plan for their future needs. Together with [[Kevin Flynn|Flynn]] and Tron, he escaped from the Game Grid during a [[Light Cycles|Light Cycle]] match. While fleeing [[Sark]]'s forces, Ram's light cycle was destroyed by [[Battle Tank|tanks]]. He was critically wounded and, after discovering that Flynn was a User and getting his promise to go on and help Tron, eventually derezzed.\n\n==Trivia==\n* Ram is probably named for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory Random-Access Memory], a form of data storage within a computer.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\ntron-disneyscreencaps.com-4470.jpg|Flynn meets Ram in his cell.\nRam Knealing.jpg\nTRN1982BluRay810pDUALx264mkv_snapshot_003356_20110817_203324.png\nram.jpg\ntron-disneyscreencaps.com-5265.jpg\ntron-disneyscreencaps.com-5897.jpg|Ram and Flynn at an energy pool.\nRam derezzes2.jpg|Ram starts to de-rez.\ntron-disneyscreencaps.com-6714.jpg|Ram's death.\n</gallery>\n\n{{TronWiki}}\n{{Tron}}\n[[Category:Tron characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Programs]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
