She is [[Prince Eric]]'s sweet and kind maid.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[The Little Mermaid]]''===\nIn the film, Carlotta is Prince Eric's maid and one of his most loyal friends. When Eric brings [[Ariel]] into [[Prince Eric's Castle|his castle]], she gives her a bath and has her dress washed for her. Then she dresses her up all nice and takes her to the dining room where she will eat with Eric and [[Grimsby]].\n\nWhen Ariel takes Grimsby's pipe and blows its contents in his face, both Eric and Carlotta laugh about it, and Carlotta tells Eric that that's the first time she's seen him smile in weeks. Grimsby then asks her what's for dinner to which she answers that he's going to love it because [[Chef Louis]] has been making them stuffed crab. When they hear a noise from the kitchen, Carlotta decides to go and see what Chef Louis is up to.\n\nWhen she reaches the kitchen, she finds him throwing stuff around and making a mess. She furiously asks him what he's doing, to which he apologizes to her for making such a mess. She then takes the food back to the table for Eric, Grimsby, and Ariel. The next day she and Grimsby are seen waving goodbye to Eric and Ariel as they leave to take a tour of the kingdom. She is finally seen again at the end of the film at Ariel and Eric's wedding, to where she becomes overly emotional and cries in Grimsby's tie.\n\n===''[[The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea]]''===\nCarlotta appears again in the sequel but has a smaller role than in the previous film. She is first seen singing \"[[Down to the Sea]]\" and celebrating the arrival of [[Melody]]. Then, when the party gets interrupted by Ursula's sister, [[Morgana]], she moves away from her, frightened.\n\nCarlotta is seen 12 years later cleaning up for Melody's twelfth birthday party. When Ariel asks her if she's seen Melody, she replies, \"Not since this morning, Your Majesty\". When Chef Louis ruins Melody's party by chasing after [[Sebastian]] and making everyone laugh, Carlotta splashes him with a bucket of water and says, \"Oh, Louie!\"\n\nAt the end after Morgana's defeat, Carlotta is seen celebrating along with the humans and [[Merpeople|merfolk]] by singing \"[[Here on the Land and Sea]]\". She then picks up Chef Louis and dances with him.\n\n==Trivia==\n*On Carlotta's original design cell (as revealed in the gallery below) her dress was originally green instead of maroon like we see in the final film and subsequent appearances.\n*Carlotta's maid outfit is exactly the same as [[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]]'s, the only difference being the sleeves being form-fitting and with cuffs at the end.\n\n==Gallery==\n\ufeff\ufeff<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\ntlmpe782.jpg\ntlmpe784.jpg\ntlmpe785.jpg\ntlmpe803.jpg\nLittle-mermaid-disneyscreencaps.com-6130.jpg\ntlmpe829.jpg\ntlmpe839.jpg\ntlmpe840.jpg|\"'''[[Chef Louis|LOUIS!]]''' WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!\"\ntlm2pic0001232.jpg\nTlm2-disneyscreencaps com-8130.jpg\nTlm2-disneyscreencaps com-2781.jpg|\"Oh, Louie!\"\nj257a.jpg|Carlotta's original design cel.\n0e963ebd3e443295b38e2c0a4add7b30.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Little Mermaid}}\n{{Kilala Princess}}\n[[fr:Carlotta]]\n[[Category:The Little Mermaid characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Servants]]\n[[Category:Kilala Princess characters]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]"
