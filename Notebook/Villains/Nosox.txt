'''Experiment 204''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]].\u00a0He\u00a0is designed to steal, hide, or otherwise make socks mysteriously vanish. He was captured by [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]], but was rescued in \"[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]\".\n\n==Background==\n===Physical appearance===\nNosox is a quadrupedal, gray experiment shaped like a four-legged washing machine with a red button for a nose, two small ears, and small white eyes with black pupils, similar to [[Skip]].\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nNosox can steal\u00a0socks and make them disappear by storing\u00a0them in a washing machine-like container in his stomach.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment 204 was the 204th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to eat socks, and thus make them disappear. 204 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch |Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.\n\n204's pod was one of the\u00a0twelve experiment pods recovered by [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Stitch]] in \"[[Drowsy (episode)|Drowsy]]\". His was one of the final four experiment pods (among [[Stopgo|102]], 274 and [[Drowsy|360]]) that [[Pleakley]], with some assistance from Stitch, cataloged after being convinced to do so by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]].\n\nAt an unknown point after this, Experiment 204, named Nosox, was presumably activated and captured by [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]], as he was mentioned in \"[[Amnesio (episode)|Amnesio]]\" when [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]] said, \"After you sent me a sock hider...\"\n\nNosox appeared in \"[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]\", and was freed along with Gantu's other captive experiments by Lilo, Stitch, and several other experiments in a rescue mission.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nThe first\u00a0624 experiments, including Nosox, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]] and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nIt is unknown whether or not Nosox participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]].\n\nThe Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.\n\n===''[[Stitch!]]''===\nNosox made an appearance in a later episode of the ''Stitch!'' anime along with [[Shrink]], [[Squeak]], [[Clip]], and [[Retro]].\n\n==Trivia==\n*Nosox is one of the rare experiments to have sclerae and pupils instead of solid black eyes, the others being [[Mr. Stenchy]], [[Mrs. Sickly]], [[Skip]], [[Clink]], and [[Bragg]].\u00a0\n*His name means \"No Socks\" (No Sox) because he is a sock hider.\n*Nosox, along with [[Richter]], [[Tank (Lilo & Stitch)|Tank]], [[Splodyhead]], [[Gigi]], Butter, [[Shortstuff]], [[Yang]], [[Spike (Lilo & Stitch)|Spike]], [[Phoon]], and one unconfirmed experiment, are the only known experiments that are primarily quadrupeds.\n*Even though Nosox was mentioned twice in Season 1, he did not officially appear activated until near the end of Season 2.\n**Nosox is the only experiment to be mentioned twice by function in two separate episodes without actually appearing activated. Ironically, we saw Nosox in [[Experiment Pods|pod]] form in the [[Drowsy (episode)|last episode]] of Season 1 with one of these mentions, even though he was activated off-screen and captured by Gantu in an [[Amnesio (episode)|earlier episode]] of Season 1.\n**This is similar to [[Fudgy]], though he did appear activated in Season 1, but not fully seen. Interestingly, both of them were rescued from Gantu in \"[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]\".\n*Nosox is one of the few experiments to not appear in the group photo at the end of ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''.\n*Nosox's\u00a0pod color is blue in the ''[[Stitch!]]'' anime.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nScreenCapture 01.02.13 20-33-00.jpg|Nosox's experiment pod\nvlcsnap-2013-07-17-21h20m34s128.png\nVlcsnap-2012-07-08-20h05m53s140.png\nvlcsnap-2013-07-15-22h32m13s53.png\nvlcsnap-2013-12-30-14h51m34s61.png\nvlcsnap-2013-12-31-09h21m39s55.png\nVlcsnap-2013-02-08-11h58m00s88.png\nVlcsnap-2012-08-02-20h56m43s41.png\nvlcsnap-2012-08-02-18h57m33s14.png\nscreenCapture 08.02.13 13-23-47.jpg\n204anime.png|Nosox in Stitch! anime\nScreenCapture 26.02.13 0-52-47.jpg\nScreenCapture 08.02.13 13-37-03.jpg\nscreenCapture 08.02.13 13-55-24.jpg\nscreenCapture 11.03.13 13-07-11.jpg\nscreenCapture 11.03.13 13-11-09.jpg|Nosox bites [[Stitch]]'s ankle\nscreenCapture 11.03.13 13-12-07.jpg\nscreenCapture 11.03.13 22-33-59.jpg\nscreenCapture 11.03.13 22-37-07.jpg\nscreenCapture 10.02.13 8-20-28.jpg\nscreenCapture 11.03.13 23-15-50.jpg\nscreenCapture 11.03.13 23-29-38.jpg\nscreenCapture 11.03.13 23-32-23.jpg\npanes32.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
