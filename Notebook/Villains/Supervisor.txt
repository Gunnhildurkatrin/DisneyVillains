She shows no mercy to her own species' safety by using machines to raise them. However, when [[Milo (Mars Needs Moms)|Milo]] discovers a mural in the translucent cavern about a true Martian family, the Supervisor's true colors are revealed to know that she betrayed and lied to all the Martians about this.\n\nShe also speaks in a broken English grammar type. Most of her dialogue heard and translated by Martian translator caused translation errors leading to poor grammar, unlike [[Ki]], who speaks English grammar fluently.\n\n==Role in the [[Mars Needs Moms|film]]==\nThe Supervisor is introduced as the head of the Martians who observes children on Earth who disobey their parents such as being disrespectful to their mothers or having unacceptable behaviors. However, she later spies on [[Milo (Mars Needs Moms)|Milo]]'s mother telling her son to put the trash away just as she plans to take his mother to Mars. She later appears leaving her lair to look at Milo's mother who was abducted by Martians just as she returns to her lair. She later appears again in a footage of her enraged that the Martians have failed to catch Milo who is escaping from them.\n\nWhile in the Martians' chamber, [[Gribble]] explains to Milo that the Supervisor is described as the ruthless leader of the Martians who watches over the whole chamber and the Citadel who runs a group of elite Martian soldiers known as the SISS patrolling the Martians' chamber under tyranny of her. During Ki's conversation with Milo, she explains that she was working at an administration block while the Supervisor was viewing some Earth documents along with her assistant elder where she was copying the language the humans say on Earth fluently while watching a sitcom TV show.\n\nLater, when Gribble is at the spot where he is about to be killed, the Supervisor summons the SISS soldiers to fire their blasters at him, to which the plan was disrupted when Milo arrives and knocks down the soldiers in order to rescue Gribble from being destroyed. The Supervisor angrily summons Ki to kill Milo and Gribble, but instead of firing her blaster, Ki instead gives the blaster to Milo, much to the Supervisor's chagrin. Later, when Milo discovers the prophecy of a Martian family with true love as Ki arrives, it is then revealed that the Martians have always been raised by machines until Milo's discovery, as it is then known that the Supervisor has betrayed the Martians for her lies and her tyrannical betrayal.\n\nWhen Milo, Gribble, Ki, and Two-Cat plan on rescuing his mother, the Supervisor summons various Martian soldiers, including the SISS, to stop them from disrupting the plans on terminating Milo's mother. Fortunately, the plan was disrupted as Milo saves his mother. Just as Milo saves his mother's life, the Supervisor stops the gang from escaping, to which Ki intervenes and shows her what a true Martian family looks like upon seeing the mural on the translucent caverns, telling them that they are not meant to be raised by machines. With her true actions revealed, the Supervisor is arrested for her crimes and betrayal to the Martians.\n\nDuring the credits, the Supervisor, now reformed, is tasked to raise baby Martians, much to her not being interested in properly caring for babies.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nSupervisors Height.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Mars Needs Moms characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Main antagonists]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]"
