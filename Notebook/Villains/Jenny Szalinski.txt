To win the argument, she makes sure her mother, [[Patti Szalinski|Patti]], wouldn't stop her from inviting her friends. To accomplish that, she, her brother, [[Mitch Szalinski|Mitch]], and cousin, [[Adam Szalinski|Adam]], bring home the groceries. Before inviting her friends, she tells Adam and Mitch to behave. However, she later despairs when Mitch faints from a potassium deficiency and they can't find his prescription medication. Luckily for her, Adam saves the day by feeding him a banana, remembering an earlier lesson from Wayne about the chemical content of bananas.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Szalinski, Jenny}}\n\n{{Honey, I Shrunk the Kids}}\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Nieces]]\n[[Category:Honey, I Shrunk the Kids characters]]"
