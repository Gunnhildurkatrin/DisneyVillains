This is the final project in the course Social Graphs and Interactions, taught at DTU 2021. This Project is about the network of Marvel villains.

Therefore, it was an easy decision to take a further look into the villains of Disney, and explore the characters which we are still to this day gradually a little bit afraid of in a new light.
