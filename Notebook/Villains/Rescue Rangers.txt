They are a team of sentient anthropomorphic animals who use their genius-level intelligence, their knowledge of hand-to-hand combat, and their high-tech gadgets and weapons to protect the innocent and fight the forces of evil.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]''===\nThe protagonist team's members are [[Chip and Dale|Chip]], [[Chip and Dale|Dale]], [[Zipper]], [[Monterey Jack]], and [[Gadget Hackwrench]]. Despite the fact that they often interact with humans (and one of their arch-nemeses, [[Professor Norton Nimnul|Professor Nimnul]], is a human), humans can't understand what they are saying.\n\nThe Rescue Rangers' headquarters are located within a tree, growing in a [[New York City]] park (presumably Central Park, due to the presence of the Chrysler Building in \"[[The Carpetsnaggers]]\" and the World Trade Center's Twin Towers in \"[[Robocat]]\").\n\nMeans of transportation for the team include the [[Ranger Plane]], the [[Ranger Wing]], and the [[Screaming Eagle]].\n\n===''[[DuckTales (2017 series)|DuckTales]]'' reboot===\nWithin the ''[[DuckTales (2017 series)|2017 reboot of ''DuckTales]]'', the Rescue Rangers are escaped laboratory test animals granted sentience by an intelligence ray created by the criminal syndicate [[F.O.W.L.]]'s scientist [[Black Heron]].\n\nThey appear in the episode \"[[Double-O-Duck in You Only Crash Twice!]]\" where [[Launchpad McQuack]] absent-mindedly helps them escape. They return the favor when he battles [[Steelbeak]] in one of the episode's climactic scene. Upon them leaving, he tells them \"Thanks for the rescue!\"\n\nThey make another appearance in \"The Last Adventure!\" where they are revealed to be some of the many adventurers, or adventure related people, to have been captured by [[F.O.W.L.]] for eradication. They, along with numerous other characters, give encouragement to Launchpad when he is up against Steelbeak and his brainwashed allies. Afterwards, they are seen along with the other freed heroes to watch [[Bradford Buzzard]]'s defeat.\n\n==Printed Media==\nIn the five-part comic book series \"[[The Legend of the Chaos God]]\", during [[Solego]]'s attack, Solego uses his powers to possess Dale, but the rest of the Rescue Rangers manage to free Dale from his influence.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"180\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nEarly development for Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers by Will Finn.jpg|Early development sketch of the team by [[Will Finn]]\nRescueRangers-promopic.png|The Rescue Rangers\nDuckTales S3E03 still 1.jpg|The Rescue Rangers on the ''DuckTales'' reboot\n</gallery>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In Frank Angones' pitch for a ''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]'' reboot, the Rescue Rangers would have been a succesor to the [[Rescue Aid Society]], with the group using a different name due to former RAS member [[Bernard (The Rescuers)|Bernard]] not allowing to use the RAS' name.\n{{Rescue Rangers}}\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Superheroes]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Chipmunks]]\n[[Category:Mice]]\n[[Category:Inventors]]\n[[Category:Detectives]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:DuckTales characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Insects]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]"
