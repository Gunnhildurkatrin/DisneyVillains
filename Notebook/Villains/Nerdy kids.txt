The blue-shirted, glasses-wearing nerd sings \"...And up with the comics!\" to finish the twin boys' previous sentence, and both nerds hold up a No. 9 issue ''Weird Planet'', a science fiction comic book.\n\nNear the end of the song, the blue-shirted nerd reappears once more right before the school bell rings. As many students (including cheerleaders, football players, the marching band, and more) gather on the school's football field to celebrate the last day of school, the blue-shirted nerd pops his head into view just as the song finishes its climax, which is immediately cut off by the school bell ringing.\n\nLater, during the end-of-school assembly, as the student body president [[Stacey]] is giving a speech, she is suddenly interrupted by the blue-shirted nerd calling out to her in a playfully mocking tone. Stacey is not amused and quickly returns to her speech. Though, when the nerd called out to Stacey, another girl sitting next to him suddenly turned her own head to look at him in bewilderment, as though she was disappointed in his interest in Stacey instead of her.\n\nA few minutes later, right in the middle of [[Principal Mazur]]'s speech, the assembly is suddenly taken over by an unexpected performance of \"[[Stand Out]]\", a song by popular rockstar [[Powerline]]. As flashes of light and lasers appear on a large projector screen, the two Nerdy kids look on in awe at the spectacle and express their approval of the special effects by high-fiving each other.\n\nAbout a week later, at a party hosted by Stacey, the blue-shirted nerd is seen watching Powerline's Los Angeles concert on TV with the other kids.\n\n===''[[Le Journal de Mickey]]''===\nOn [[February 12]], [[1997]], Issue #2330 of the French magazine ''[[Le Journal de Mickey]]'' published a special ''Dingo & Max''<ref>\"Goofy & Max\", the French title of ''A Goofy Movie''</ref> comic strip that starred characters from ''A Goofy Movie''. In this story, titled \"Je T'Ayuck\" (\"I Ayuck You\"),<ref>A play on the phrase \"Je T'Aime\", which is French for \"I Love You\"</ref> the blue-shirted, glasses-wearing Nerdy kid is featured as a member of the high school's theater workshop, along with [[Roxanne]] and another student named Hubert.\n\nWhen [[Max Goof]] first learns about a special play starring Roxanne and Hubert to be performed for the whole school in honor of Valentine's Day, the Nerdy kid pops up to explain that it was meant to be a surprise that no one outside the theater workshop knew about. He then boasts about having not only knowing about the play but also having written it himself. But when he hears Max speak the name of Roxanne's character, \"Laetitia\", he demands to know how Max knew of that name since all details about the play were supposed to have been kept secret.\n\nIt is then discovered that Hubert got sick, meaning that the play would have to be canceled. Fortunately, Max offers to fill in for Hubert and the play goes off without a hitch. During the performance, the Nerdy kid basks in his pride over the play, reading over the script in hand and recalling each actor's lines in his head. But, when the final scene comes, Max and Roxanne go slightly off script by using their real names instead of their character names, much to the ire of the nerd, who is then shushed by [[P.J.]] The audiences cheers, nevertheless.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nA Goofy Movie Nerdy kids 02.jpg\nA Goofy Movie Nerdy kids 03.jpg\nA Goofy Movie Nerdy kids 04.jpg\nA Goofy Movie Nerdy kids 05.jpg\nA Goofy Movie Nerdy kids 06.jpg\nA Goofy Movie Nerdy kids 07.jpg\nA Goofy Movie Nerdy kids 08.jpg\nA Goofy Movie Nerdy kids 09.jpg\nA Goofy Movie Nerdy kids 10.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*The nerds are never named or referred to by anything in the movie itself. The designation \"Nerdy kids\" comes from the movie's script.<ref>[http://thescriptsavant.com/pdf/AGoofyMovie.pdf ''A Goofy Movie'' screenplay] presented by Scriptdude</ref>\n*The Nerdy kids are obviously designed to resemble ''Star Trek'' fans dressed as Captain James T. Kirk (the gold-shirted kid) and Mr. Spock (the blue-shirted kid), albeit with their Starfleet insignia turned upside-down to resemble a V-shape instead (likely to avoid copyright infringement).\n*The Nerdy kids are also given stereotypical 'nerd' attributes such as face acne, braces, and out-of-shape physiques (the blue-shirted kid is skinny while the gold-shirted kid is overweight).\n*When the blue-shirted nerd calls out to Stacey, his nose is drawn and colored more akin to a human nose than to a dog's nose like it is the rest of the time.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Goof Troop}}\n[[Category:Goofy Movie Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]"
