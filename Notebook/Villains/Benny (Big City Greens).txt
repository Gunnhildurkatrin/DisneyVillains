He is an unusual child who is friends with [[Cricket Green]] and hangs out with him and his other friends.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nBenny is a strange child. He is the youngest in his circle of friends (which include Cricket and [[Tilly Green]], [[Remy Remington]], [[Kiki (Big City Greens)|Kiki]], and [[Weezie]]). Despite this, he seems unusually well adjusted and has a pretty high vocabulary for his age. He can be pretty grim such as in \"[[Swimming Fool]]\" where he claimed that the last kid who jumped from the high dive had caused a \"b[l]oodbath\". Conversely, he acts like a typical 5 year old as he enjoys the ''Croblins'' film series and sometimes causes stress for his mother by acting like he does not know her.\n\n===Appearance===\nBenny is a tiny child, much smaller than Cricket or Remy. He has yellow skin and a small blue tuft of hair on his head. He has an oval shaped head and puffy cheeks. He typically wears a simple cyan colored shirt and red pants with black shoes.\n\n==Trivia==\n* Benny seems to have a speech impediment as his l's and r's are occasionally replaced with w's like [[wikipedia:Elmer Fudd|Elmer Fudd]].\n*He somewhat resembles Stewie Griffin from ''Family Guy''.\n*Benny is the only kid in Cricket and Tilly's social group to actually be voiced by a child actor, at least at the time of recording. [[Gabriella Espinosa]] comes close, though her voice actress is in her late teens, again at the time of recording.\n\n==External links==\n*{{Interwiki|https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/countryclub9732/images/6/64/Favicon.ico|bigcitygreens|Benny|Big City Greens Wiki}}\n\n{{Big City Greens}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Big City Greens characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]"
