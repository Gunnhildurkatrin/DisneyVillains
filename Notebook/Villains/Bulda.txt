She is a female [[Trolls (Frozen)|troll]] and the adoptive mother of [[Kristoff]].\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Frozen]]''===\nBulda is shown towards the beginning of the film, when [[King Agnarr]] and [[Queen Iduna]] are rushing to save [[Anna]], after she is struck by [[Elsa]]'s ice powers. A young [[Kristoff]] and [[Sven]] arrive at the scene, where Bulda adopts them.\n\nBulda appears later in the film, during the second meeting with the [[Trolls (Frozen)|trolls]] and the \"[[Fixer Upper]]\" song sequence. Bulda takes Anna for Kristoff's girlfriend, along with the other female trolls, assist in dressing Anna in her troll wedding outfit.\n\n===''[[Frozen II]]''===\nBulda plays a much smaller role, first appearing after the [[Arendelle|Arendellians]] were forced out of their home by the [[Spirits of the Enchanted Forest|spirits]]. She excitedly leaps onto Kristoff, exclaiming that she and the trolls have missed him.\n\nDuring the climax, Bulda, Cliff, and [[Grand Pabbie]] are seen watching alongside the Arendellians as Elsa saves the kingdom from being destroyed by a massive wave.\n\n==Gallery==\n\n===''Frozen''===\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nFrozen-disneyscreencaps.com-617.png\nFrozen-disneyscreencaps.com-7636.jpg|\"He's brought a girl!\"\nFrozen-disneyscreencaps.com-7661.png\nFrozen-disneyscreencaps.com-7683.jpg\nFrozen-disneyscreencaps.com-7696.jpg\nFrozen-disneyscreencaps.com-7925.png\nFixerUpper snapshot.jpg\n2014-01-12 04.55.01 am.png\n2014-01-12 04.55.33 am.png\n2014-01-12 04.55.53 am.png\n2014-01-12 04.56.06 am.png\nFrozen-disneyscreencaps.com-8111.jpg|\"A true love's kiss, perhaps?\"\nFrozen-disneyscreencaps.com-8113.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===''Frozen II''===\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nFrozen - Shocked Crows.png\n</gallery>\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nCuties I'm Gonna Keep You Frozen Poster.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*The junior novelization and Essential Guide misspell her name as \"Hulda\".<ref>''Frozen'': The Junior Novelization, p. 8</ref><ref name=\":0\">''Frozen'': The Essential Guide, p. 51</ref>\n*She is 700 years old, according to the Essential Guide.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Bulda's name is phonetically similar to the word \"boulder\".\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*{{Interwiki|https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/frozen/images/6/64/Favicon.ico|Frozen|Bulda|Frozen Wiki}}\n{{Frozen}}\n[[es:Bulda]]\n[[ja:\u30d0\u30eb\u30c0]]\n[[pl:Bulda]]\n[[pt-br:Bulda]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Frozen characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Trolls]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Immortal]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]"
