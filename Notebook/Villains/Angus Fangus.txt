The Duck Avenger saved all the guests from an attack by the [[Evronians]]. Angus doesn't believe it was an alien attack, but he accuses the Duck Avenger of breaking into the party with alleged \"accomplices\". Since then (and even before), Angus tries to convince the Duckburgians, with his news program, that the Duck Avenger is a public menace.\n\nAngus is a parody of the [[Marvel Comics]] character [[J. Jonah Jameson|Jonah Jameson]], but unlike JJ, he may dare to edit fake news to show his point of view.\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nDan Woodstein and Angus Fangus.jpg|Angus' first appearance.\nAngus_and_Rangi_Fangus.jpg|Angus and his mother.\nAngus23.jpg \n</gallery>\n\n{{PKNA}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fangus, Angus}}\n\n[[ar:\u062d\u0646\u0643\u0634 \u0641\u0646\u0643\u0634]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Birds]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in comics]]"
