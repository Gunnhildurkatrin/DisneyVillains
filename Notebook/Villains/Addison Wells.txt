She reveals that she has to hide her real hair under a blonde wig thus she has a hard time fitting into the community of Seabrook, which is obsessively \"perfect\" and against anything flawed. Addison starts off her first day of school with a healthy breakfast. She is in her kitchen and eating a bowl of fruit and has a glass of water. Her parents are also in the kitchen talking about how excited they are about cheer tryouts. They are very supportive of her with sports. Her dad is the chief of the \u201cZombie Patrol\u201d as he is seen with a pin that states that. Her mom is being re-elected for mayor, so it is very important that Addison makes the cheer squad. They tell that nothing will stop her as long as she keeps her wig on.\n\nOnce she arrives to Seabrook High, she is super excited about the school year. Her cousin and captain of the cheer squad, Bucky and his co-captains, Stacey, Lacey and Tracey, also know as the ACEYS, tell her that they can't let zombies change the way things are in town. Addison admits that they're just going to school like the humans which Bucky admonishes that zombies are nothing like humans and they tried to kill their grandfather, even though Addison admits that it was just a \"small bite.\" There she meets another cheer hopeful, Bree and they bond over their love for cheer.\n\nThe Z-Alarm suddenly goes off as someone spotted a zombie in the halls, Addison tries to calm an anxious Bree down by showing her the Zombie Safe Room and that it'll be alright.

The two of them begin a friendly conversation about their goals for the school year and the boy introduces himself as [./Zed. After Addison introduces herself, the lights turn on and is shocked to find out that Zed is a zombie. Horrified, Addison punches Zed in the face, only to find him in pain.

However, she becomes excited when Bree announces that there are zombies at the pep rally. Addison rushes over and is happy that they accepted her invitation and is really happy that Zed came.
