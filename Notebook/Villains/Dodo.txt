He plays a much larger role than in the book. He is a mixture between the Dodo and Pat the Gardener.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Alice in Wonderland]]''===\nDodo was first seen as [[Alice]] was floating on the sea in a bottle. Dodo was seen singing while riding an upside-down toucan as a boat and being propelled forth by a flying hawk from behind, but when Alice asked him for help, he did not notice her. On the shore, Dodo was seen on a rock, organizing a caucus race. This race involved running around until one gets dry, but the attempts were hampered by incoming waves.\n\nDodo was later summoned by the [[White Rabbit]], when the rabbit believed a \"monster\", actually Alice having magically grown to a giant size, was inside his home. Dodo brought [[Bill the Lizard]] and attempted to get him to go down the chimney. Bill refused at first, but Dodo was able to convince him otherwise. However, the soot caused Alice to sneeze, sending Bill high up into the sky. Dodo then decided to burn the house down, much to the chagrin of the White Rabbit. He began gathering wood, such as the furniture, for this purpose. However, Alice was soon able to return to a smaller size and exit the house.\n\nThe White Rabbit soon left, while Dodo asked for matches, not realizing that the situation had been resolved. He then asked Alice for a match, but when she didn't have any, Dodo complained about the lack of cooperation and used his pipe to light the fire.\n\nNear the end of the film, the Dodo was seen conducting another caucus race. In addition to Alice (who was chased by the [[Queen of Hearts]] and her [[Card Soldiers|card soldiers]]), the toucan, and the hawk; the [[Mad Hatter]], the [[March Hare]], the [[King of Hearts]], the Queen of Hearts, [[Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum]], [[The Walrus and the Carpenter|the Walrus and the Carpenter]], 6 of the [[Curious Oysters]], and an army of card soldiers were part of the race. Then as Alice leaves [[Wonderland]], she wakes up, her adventure in Wonderland was all a dream, as she is woken up by her sister.\n\n===''[[Mickey Mousecapade]]''===\nThe Dodo appeared as the second boss in this Nintendo game, but only in the Japanese version. In the American release, he was replaced by [[Tick-Tock the Crocodile]], from [[Peter  Pan |Peter Pan]].\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\nDodo makes a cameo appearance in the [[House of Mouse]], during the opening theme, alongside [[Bill the Lizard]].\n\n== Printed media ==\n\n=== Comics ===\nThe Dodo was seen in many Disney comics of the Mickey Mouse universe. In a story, he met [[Grandma Duck]]. In another, entitled ''Unbirthday party with Alice in Wonderland'', Alice came back to Wonderland in going throw her looking glass and met the Dodo a second time. In ''The White Rabbit and the Magic Watch'', the White Rabbit met during a race with various Wonderland characters, including the Dodo. In ''A Day in Wonderland'', part of the frame story, ''Uncle Scrooge Goes to Disneyland'', [[Alice]] invited [[Daisy Duck]] to see the Wonderland, and she meets various Wonderlander characters, including the Dodo. In the Brazilian story, ''No Pa\u00eds Das Maravilhas'', the Red Bat ([[Fethry Duck]]'s superhero identity) went to Wonderland to catch a thief who took refuge there and met the Dodo and other Wonderland characters. In ''Dangerous Diggings'', Mickey's nephews dug a tunnel to Wonderland and met various Wonderland characters, including the Dodo. The Brazilian remake of this story, ''Natal Muito Doido'', with the [[Beagle Boys]] taking the place of the nephews, didn't contain the Dodo.\n\n== Video Games ==\n\n=== [[Kinect: Disneyland Adventures]] ===\nHe is mentioned by the [[White Rabbit]] in [[Kinect: Disneyland Adventures]]<ref>'''White Rabbit:''' Oh don't trust the Dodo for construction repairs </ref>.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n{{Alice in Wonderland}}\n\n[[es:Don Dodo]]\n[[Category:Article of the week]]\n[[Category:Alice in Wonderland characters]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Sailors]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:English characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Video game bosses]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Once Upon a Time characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Birds]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
