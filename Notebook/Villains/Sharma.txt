She works as a teacher at the [[Agrabah|Royal Academy]].\n\n===Personality===\nThough she only has a brief appearance, Sharma is obviously stressed out about her job and overworked. She is similar to her cousin in the first movie; Jasmine is frustrated with her duties as a princess and Sharma is frustrated with her duties as a teacher.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nSharma is a Middle Eastern young woman. She does look a lot like Jasmine. They both have the same medium-tanned skin, wide brown eyes, broad nose, red lips, thick black eyebrows, and black hair, but she has thick bangs.\n\nSharma wears a lavender head scarf, bell sleeved long purple dress, purple harem pants, magenta waist slash, brown curled toe shoes, and brown hoop earrings. Unlike Jasmine's, her attire is more culturally accurate and modest.\n\n=== Abilities ===\nSharma must be pretty intelligent to be a teacher.\n\n==Appearances==\nSharma is never seen or mentioned in the original three ''[[Aladdin (1992 film)|Aladdin]]'' movies. She is only seen briefly in ''[[Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: Follow Your Dreams]]''.\n\n===''Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: Follow Your Dreams''===\nSharma appears as a school teacher who is stressed out by her unruly pupils at Royal Academy. When Jasmine comes to the academy one day to be her \"Royal Assistant Educator\", she runs out of the Academy distressed and is relieved to see her cousin. She thanks her for being there but informs her she needs to take a \"mental health day\". She also warns Jasmine if she needs help to call the guards\u2014lots of them for that matter.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Sharma is the first seen or mentioned relative of a Disney Princess who is not a spouse, sibling, or parent.\n*[[The Sultan]] mentions that Sharma is Jasmine's cousin, though he never mentions whether she is her paternal or maternal cousin. However, Sharma was probably meant to be her maternal cousin since she looks nothing like The Sultan and bears a resemblance to Jasmine, who is supposed to look like her mother.\n\n{{Aladdin}}\n[[Category:Schoolteachers]]\n[[Category:Middle Eastern characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Aladdin characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Cousins]]\n[[Category:Nieces]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
