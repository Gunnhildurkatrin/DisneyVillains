She is an ostrich ballerina who represents the dawn.\n\n==Background==\n===Physical appearance===\nMadame Upanova is a black ostrich with feminine features. She always loves pink as her favorite color, so she wears a pink bow with matching ballet slippers and has a thin black ribbon around her neck.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Fantasia]]''===\nMadame Upanova is in a segment called \"[[Dance of the Hours]]\". She appears in the beginning with all [[Ostriches (Fantasia)|her students]]. She wakes herself and all of them up as the curtains open. Her pirouette is caused by their reach over her as it is thrust up high with lots of feathers shed. As she feeds some of her students some fruit from the conch, she tries to eat the purple grapes she holds in her beak and get away from the squabbling of all her students. As they pursue her, one of them makes her drop the grapes, causing them to fall into the water, and they all flee from the bubbles coming from the fountain.\n\n===''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''===\nMadame Upanova makes two cameo appearances in ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit''. First, she walks to the Maroon Cartoons Studio door, giving [[Eddie Valiant]] the cold shoulder as she passes him. She, along with half the ''Fantasia'' cast and [[Dumbo (character)|Dumbo]], are on loan to Maroon from Disney. Her second appearance is among a group of [[toon]]s in the finale.\n\n===''[[Aladdin (TV series)|Aladdin]]''===\nMadame Upanova makes a cameo in one of the episodes conjured by [[Genie]], where she is shown holding an egg.\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\nIn the episode \"[[Donald's Pumbaa Prank]]\", she is seen ducking her head into a three-layered cake with a cherry on top of it when [[Pumbaa]] is about to stink up the club.\n\n=== ''[[Princess Academy]]'' ===\nHer role is unknown due to this program being canceled.\n\n==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==\n[[File:Ostrich WDW.jpg|Madame Upanova at Disney Parks|thumb|250px]]\nOstriches resembling Madame Upanova (possibly her students in her colors) are walkaround characters that appear in parades. Upanova also appears in the [[Disneyland Hotel]]'s Fantasia Store as a statue. A statue also appears outside the pool area at the [[Disneyland Hotel (Disneyland Paris)|Disneyland Hotel]] at [[Disneyland Paris]]. She can also be seen in the Main Street Electrical Parade and in [[Fantasmic!]]'s bubble sequence.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Despite being referred to as female by the development staff, Madame Upanova's feather colors are of a male's. Much like peacocks where males are bright and colorful, and females are shades of brown and grey, only male ostriches have black and white feathers, while females are varying shades of brown like female peacocks.\n*In production, Madame Upanova was referred to as '''Mademoiselle Upanova'''; however, she is marketed as Madame Upanova. * her name is a play on the phrase, \u201cUp and Over\u201d.\n\n==References==\n{{Fantasia}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Fantasia characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Fantasmic characters]]\n[[Category:Who Framed Roger Rabbit cameos]]\n[[Category:Ostrich]]\n[[Category:Dancers]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Wonderful World of Color]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:French characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse (TV series) characters]]"
