They are shown to be luring people into their trap as it is said that sailors traded spices for their local food (long pork, aka flesh).\n\nThe native language they speak is Umshoko, a mix of various languages. Jack uses it well enough so he can speak to them. They also decorated their bodies with paint, piercings and tribal masks to help them camouflage, in order to ambush unsuspecting prey. Their native homes are in the craggy jungle steppes with their huts made of plant fiber. For weapons, the Pelegostos tribe used spears, machetes and blow-pipes loaded with drugged darts.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]''===\nAs [[Pintel and Ragetti]] arrive at [[Pelegostos]] while trying to get the ''[[Black Pearl]]'' out of beach, Ragetti tells his companion Pintel to cancel the plan because the two could be facing danger. Meanwhile, [[Jack Sparrow]] is crowned as the ruler of the Pelegostos tribe. Jack asks them for more fire so some of the Pelegostos members add more wood; however, they only notice Jack has left. Back with them, the tribe tries to eat Jack, as the cannibals prepare for a big fire just as Jack distracts the cannibals to help him escape from a fiery fate. As [[Joshamee Gibbs]], [[Will Turner]], and the crew of the ''Black Pearl'' arrive on top of the island, the tribe chases the prisoners while Jack grabs a knife from a nearby tribesman to free himself. As the tribe approaches closer, Jack's crew frees themselves from their cage after falling into water just as the tribe prepares to throw spears at the group, but this was interrupted when a boy part of the tribe explains that Jack has escaped.\n\nEscaping the villages, Jack and his crew prepare to get the ''Black Pearl'' out of the beach just as the Pelegostos tribe charges towards Jack and his crew because the dinner was disrupted while the [[Prison Dog]] barks to alert the crew that the tribe wants Jack back for their ritual. Having escaped from the tribe, the Prison Dog is left behind just as the tribe chases him across the island.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, it is shown that the Prison Dog is crowned as the chief of the Pelegostos. In the sequel film, ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]'', the dog is shown to be fine and in the possession of [[Edward Teague]] in [[Shipwreck Cove]].\n\n==Other Appearances==\n\n===Printed Materials===\nIn the \"''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales]]''\" novelization by Elizabeth Rudnick, it is said that Pelegostos would be recapped by Jack Sparrow who told his crew to pay tribute to his encounter with the Pelegostos tribe.\n\n===[[Disney Parks]]===\n\n====[[Pirate's Lair on Tom Sawyer Island]]====\nWhile not appearing in the park, the bone-cages of the Pelegostos can be seen at the Pirate's Lair on Tom Sawyer Island in [[Disneyland]] in the area known as smuggler's cove. It provides photo-opportunities for guests.\n\n====[[Trader Sam's|Trader Sam's Enchanted Tiki Bar]]====\nThere is an image in this bar of Jack Sparrow alongside [[Trader Sam]] on Pelegostos alongside a tribal warrior of the island.\n\n==The Tribe's Umshoko Language==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Phrase\n!Meaning\n|-\n|Rah rah rah fi fi\n|Big, big, big fire\n|-\n|Bugo\n|Please\n|-\n|Kamino\n|Come back\n|}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://pirates.fandom.com/wiki/Pelegostos_Tribe Pelegostos Tribe] on [https://pirates.fandom.com/wiki/ Pirates of the Caribbean Wiki].\n\n{{Pirates of the Caribbean}}\n[[Category:Pirates of the Caribbean characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Adults]]"
