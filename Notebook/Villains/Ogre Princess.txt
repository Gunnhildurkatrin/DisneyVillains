She adores proper manners and being polite. She guards the entrance to Tiara Tunnel. None may pass unless they demonstrate a proper greeting fitting of a princess. She is also a tad sensitive about her appearance, as displayed once [[Captain Hook]] and his crew reach Tiara Tunnel.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates]]''===\nThe Ogre Princess first appeared in the episode \"[[Princess Power!]]\". While on the search for the princess treasure, [[Jake (Pirate)|Jake]] and his crew accompanied by the [[Pirate Princess]] and princess [[Winger]] encounter the Ogre Princess. [[Skully]] whispers to his comrades that the ogre isn't like any princess he had seen before, but the Pirate Princess reminds Skully that there is more to being a princess than her physical appearance, and states the Ogre Princess displays that within. As previously mentioned, the Ogre Princess will only allow those to pass Tiara Tunnel if they display good manners, which wasn't too much a trial for the young pirates. But once inside the tunnel, the young pirates find themselves puzzled as to how to pass the giant spinning tiaras. Luckily, the Ogre Princess also deactivates the spinning hazard, and sees the young pirates off through the end of the tunnel. Meanwhile, Captain Hook and his crew disguised as princesses were also after the princess' treasure, finally arriving at Tiara Tunnel where they are briefly delayed by the Ogre Princess. Hook couldn't see past the ogre's appearance to even hear the Ogre Princess' rules to gain passage through the tunnel, much to the Ogre Princess' annoyances, and her anger sends Hook and his crew fleeing through the Tiara Tunnel.\n\n==Episode Appearances==\n*\"[[Princess Power!]]\" <small>(first appearance)</small>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nOgre Princess02.png\nOgre Princess03.png\nPrincess Power 2.jpg\nPrincess Power 3.jpg\nOgre Princess03.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Jake and the Never Land Pirates}}\n[[Category:Jake and the Never Land Pirates characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Princesses]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]"
