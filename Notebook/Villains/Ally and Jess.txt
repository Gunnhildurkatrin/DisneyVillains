Gals''') are supporting characters in the [[2019]] animated series ''[[Amphibia]].''\n\n== Role in the series ==\n[[Polly Plantar|Polly]] jumps on the computer and finds videos by the I.T. Gals who specialize in programming and fixing robots. Polly stays up all night watching the videos and working on the robot, and when she gets to a problem with powering [[Frobo]], calls the duo directly who help her learn what battery to put in place of the two AAs she stole out of the TV remote.\n\nEven the I.T. Gals tell her not to power it on in the garage, take it to an empty warehouse or open space, and even offered to help her find one before Polly disconnects the call and goes to power on Frobo. \n\nThe I.T. Gals show up looking for the girl they were talking to, and Anne and the Plantars just point up. Frobo\u2019s boosters start to fail, and the two start on path crashing back to Earth. Polly, mourning her lost friend, starts to sob and the \ntears seep into Frobo\u2019s hard drive, shorting him out and restoring his memory. He places Polly in the dryer portion of his torso that Polly has given him to keep her safe, and they smash back into the ground.\n\nWhile all of his body is destroyed, his head stays intact and powered on, still able to communicate with Polly.\n\nThe I.T. Gals show up and discuss with Polly how to fix him.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In Ally and Jess' video description, they refer to each other as \"just two girlfriends \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\" implying that they are a couple.
