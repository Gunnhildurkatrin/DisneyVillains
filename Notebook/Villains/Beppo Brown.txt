He is the father of [[Django Brown]] (one of [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]] and [[Ferb Fletcher|Ferb]]\u2019s friends) and [[Jenny Brown]] (one of [[Candace Flynn|Candace]]\u2019s friends). He is voiced by [[Joel Grey]].\n\n==Career==\nBeppo is a well-known environmental installation artist, and has had at least three exhibitions at Jefferson County\u2019s museum of contemporary art. All of his sculptures seem to be based on over-sized versions of everyday objects. One exhibition is called \u201cReally Big Art Supplies\u201d; another one is called \u201cDonuts Over The Mountain\u201d, and is, as the name implies, several over-sized donuts placed over a mountain range (\u201c[[Oil on Candace]]\u201d).\n\n==Relationships==\n===[[Django Brown]]===\n[[Django Brown|Django]] seems to have inherited artistic talent from his father, but he seems intimidated by the fact that he can only make \u201csmall\u201d things compared to Beppo\u2019s over-sized creations. Phineas and Ferb tried to help Django make a huge painting to impress Beppo, but in the end, Beppo told Django he liked his art fine and honored it by hanging it on his giant fridge (\u201c[[Oil on Candace]]\u201d).\n\n===[[Jenny Brown]]===\nNothing is really known about their relationship, but it is known that she is his daughter as confirmed by [[Dan Povenmire]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*\"[[Oil on Candace]]\" <sup>(First appearance)</sup>\n*\"[[Phineas and Ferb Christmas Vacation!]]\"\n\n{{PF-Wiki}}\n{{Phineas and Ferb}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brown, Beppo}}\n[[Category:Phineas and Ferb characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Australian characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Artists]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
