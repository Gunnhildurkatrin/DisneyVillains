He serves as the icon of the aforementioned theme park.\n\nDue to the attraction's success, the character later appeared in many merchandise and media inspired by the attraction.\n\n==Background==\nHe is a wacky cuckoo clock with a smiling face (which resembles circle-shape with glasses on in all versions of the ride except the Disneyland Paris version, which is a sun on one half and a moon on the other) rocking to the ticking sound he makes.\n\nEvery fifteen minutes, he opens his base doors and a squad of [[It's a Small World Dolls|dolls]] dressed like they are from around the world come out. They parade for the riders to the instrumental toy soldier version of the ride's [[It's a Small World (song)|titular theme song]]. After they return to the clock's interiors, Glockenspiel would close the parade door and opens his central doors to reveal the time (with the hour represented by large number blocks and the quarter hour by small blocks) as jesters would ring the big bells (for the hour) and small bells (for the quarter hour) and then close the doors one last time and remain a normal clock tower for another fifteen minutes.\n\n==Appearances==\n===[[It's a Small World]]===\nGlockenspiel first debuted when the It's a Small World attraction moved to [[Disneyland]] in [[1966]]. He serves as one of \"It's a Small World's\" icons in the aforementioned Disney Parks. As said above, the clock's head rotates randomly and occasionally, a clock parade occurs throughout the queue. Afterwards, the current hour shown inside Glockenspiel reveals two jesters inside ringing out the current time.\n\nDue to the success of the attraction, the \"It's a Small World\" attraction was later constructed in [[Magic Kingdom]], [[Tokyo Disneyland]], [[Disneyland Paris]], and [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] because of how popular the attraction is, still with the clock tower scene.\n\n===''[[Epic Mickey]]''===\n{{Main|Clock Tower (Epic Mickey)}}\n\n===''[[It's a Small World: The Animated Series]]''===\nBecause the series is based on the original attraction, the clock tower from the original attraction has to be included. Glockenspiel appears briefly at the opening of every episode and also in the show's opening song.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nIasw1.jpg|Glockenspiel as he appears in the [[It's a Small World: The Animated Series|''It's a Small World'' animated series]]\nIt's a small world.png|Glockenspiel's cameo in the ''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]'' episode, ''[[O Sole Minnie]]''.\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Landmarks such as the [[Eiffel Tower]] and the Leaning Tower of Pisa can be seen on Glockenspiel.\n*The Magic Kingdom version still uses the same clock tower in the ride, but does not include the clock parade.\n*In the Disneyland Paris version, Glockenspiel's face is designed to have the face of a wide awake sun on his left half and a sleeping moon on his right half.\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:It's a Small World]]\n[[Category:Playhouse Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Timepieces]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse (TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Kinect Disneyland Adventures characters]]"
