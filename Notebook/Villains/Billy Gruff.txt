He was [[Bear (Goldie & Bear)|Bear]]'s old friend before he moved away. He appears in the episode \"[[Billy the Kid]]\".\n==Role in the episode==\nWhile his mom is visiting a friend in a nearby forest, she drops Billy off to visit Bear for the day. [[Goldie (Goldie & Bear)|Goldie]] becomes interested in all the things Bear did with Billy while he still lived in [[Fairy Tale Forest (Goldie & Bear)|Fairy Tale Forest]]. Bear tells Goldie that the games Billy played were way too rough for him. Bear is reluctant to admit it -- until Billy head butts Bear's golden kickball a long distance. Bear finally blurts out that Billy has always been way too rough with everything, and he never did like playing any of Billy's rough games. This leaves Billy feeling down in the dumps, and he goes to wait until his mom returns to pick him up. When Bear goes to retrieve his kickball, he finds out that the ball knocked a troll's apple into the mud. The troll is now furious and starts to corner Bear, who yells for help. Hearing Bear's cries, Billy runs over, and Goldie tells him what has happened. Billy looks around and spots an apple tree close to the bridge. Billy charges at the tree, knocking several apples off the branches. While the troll helps himself to the freshly fallen apples, Billy retrieves the golden kickball and the the trio split. Bear apologizes to Billy for his actions, and the two make up. Billy then gives Goldie and Bear a nice, soft hug.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nBilly and Bear.png\nBilly looks at Fairy Tale Forest.png\nBear Billy Jack.png\nDuck Duck Goat.png\nBilly Gruff 009.png\nPaper plate for desert.png\nBear scolds Billy.png\nHead-butt apple tree.png\nBilly the Kid let's split.png\nBilly Bear Goldie Hug.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Goldie & Bear}}\n[[Category:Goldie & Bear characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Goats]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
