When Bulba's airship was zapped by the anti-gravity beam of the malfunctioning Waddlemeyer [[Ramrod]] and splashed down into Audubon Bay, Clovis escaped by jumping out and parachuting to safety, reflecting the fact that her mother had wanted her to be a dental hygienist.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the ''Disney Comics'' adaptation, Clovis is strongly implied to have been killed when she self-destructs the airship on Bulba's orders.\n*Clovis shares the same late voice actress as Mrs. Cavanaugh, [[Marcia Wallace]].\n*In \"[[Hot Spells]]\", Clovis has a cameo in the line of the damned.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nBulba4.png\nBulba7.jpg\n474701-vlcsnap 00509.jpg\nClovis14.jpg\nClovis24.jpg\n474868-vlcsnap 00738.jpg\nClovis57.jpg\nClovis36.jpg\nClovis42.jpg\nVlcsnap-2016-04-12-16h37m16s616.png\nVlcsnap-2016-04-12-16h38m25s850.png\nvlcsnap-2015-10-17-23h44m12s766.png|Parachuting to safety\n</gallery>{{Darkwing Duck}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Darkwing Duck characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Cattle]]"
