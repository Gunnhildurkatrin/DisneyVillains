He is one of the members of the Junkyard Dogs.\n==Background==\n===Physical Description===\nFrancois is the smallest of the Junkyard Dogs. His appearance is more like a [[wikipedia:Boston terrier|Boston terrier]], and he has a French accent.\n\n===Personality===\nFrancois is suave, loyal, kind, and rambunctious and often gets into mischief, such as getting electrically shocked. He also likes ripping apart chicken skin and doesn't like being perfumed. He has a bit of a snobbish attitude, but isn't above congratulating [[Scamp]] on his heroic actions with unusual kisses on his cheeks. He accidentally managed to get Scamp captured by [[the Dogcatcher]] and taken to [[Dog Pound|the pound]], with no thanks to [[Buster (Lady and the Tramp)|Buster]] who was responsible for that accident by using his own member as bait. Francois even showed guilt and remorse for unwillingly leading Scamp into trouble. Francois eventually leaves the junkyard with the other Junkyard Dogs\u00a0minus Buster, and gets adopted by a family.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Francois' name is equivalent to [[Francis]] in ''[[Oliver & Company]]''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\n711725_1304862653517_full.jpg\nChar 25058.jpg\nPic detail4c647b1c3f993.png|Francois with [[Scamp]]\n346036 1261575615523 full.jpg|Francois howling with the other Junkyard Dogs\n252px-Tramp2-disneyscreencaps com-5993.jpg\nLady-tramp-2-disneyscreencaps.com-7487.jpg|Francois and the other junkyard dogs with their new owners\n</gallery>\n\n{{Lady and the Tramp}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Francois}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Lady and the Tramp characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:French characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]"
