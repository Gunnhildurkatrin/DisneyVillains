"{{Infobox character||image = Luis Mendoza.jpg}}'''Luis Mendoza''' is a hockey player from [[Miami]], [[Florida]]. He plays at the forward position and wears Number 22. He first appeared in the film ''[[D2: The Mighty Ducks]]'' as part of [[Team USA (Junior Goodwill Games)]]. Luis is the team's fastest skater, having been clocked 1.9 seconds from blue line to blue line. Unfortunately, Luis has trouble stopping, which causes humorous collisions in the games. He's only shown being able to stop once in D2 when he steals the puck from one of the [[Iceland]] players and stops in time in front of their goal before shooting the puck in. Luis also attended [[Eden Hall Academy]], as seen in ''[[D3: The Mighty Ducks]]''. Once at Eden Hall, Luis flirts with the head cheerleader who happens to be the girlfriend of the varsity hockey captain. She is at first, resistant to his charms but finds something different about the smooth-talking guy from Miami and eventually is seen kissing him after the Varsity vs JV game. Luis is portrayed by Mike Vitar.\n\n== Playing Style ==\nLuis' remarkable speed on the ice makes him an offensive threat, as he is able to out skate opposing defenses. His speed often shakes the confidence of opposing goaltenders, which allows him to score easily. However, his primary weakness is his lack of control, as he is unable to stop on most occasions, which leaves him vulnerable, as shown in the second film when he is tripped by Iceland's defense during their first encounter.{{The Mighty Ducks}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mendoza, Luis}}\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:The Mighty Ducks characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]"
