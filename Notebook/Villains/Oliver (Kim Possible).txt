He appeared in the episode \"[[Grudge Match]].\"\n==History==\nHe is introduced as [[Vivian Francis Porter]]'s new boyfriend. He started a local underground robot fighting club, known as the \"Robot Rumble.\"\n\nAt the rumble, [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim]] introduces herself to Vivian who's quite pleased to meet her, until she mentions that she's working for Fen, and turns on her. Oliver challenges her to a duel in the arena, but Kim doesn't have a robot of her own. When she contacts [[Wade]] about it, he suggests using the [[Kimmunicator]], causing the whole club to laugh at the three of them. Oliver controls the robot during the battle. The Kimmunicator does surprisingly well for such a small device, but in the end gets destroyed. During the battle, Kim realizes that\u00a0Vivian's robot has artificial intelligence, and insinuates that she may have gotten it\u00a0from the space center. Oliver stands up to defend Vivian, and as her robot returns her crushed Kimmunicator.\n\nKim and [[Ron Stoppable|Ron]] arrive at the [[Middleton Space Center]], to confront Fen, Oliver accuses him of stealing the robot, and almost attacks him, until Vivian stops him. Kim finally enters the lab to tell him she knows he's the thief, but Fen insists that he doesn't care, because he's got the reputation as the expert. He then threatens to destroy Oliver's robot if Kim didn't let him go, but a clever use of the same electromagnet from the Jupiter project saved the robot. In the process, Oliver also gets caught in the magnet and we find out Oliver was also a robot.\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"medium\" position=\"center\">\nOliver Angry.jpg\nOliver Close Up.jpg\nOliver Robot.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Kim Possible}}\n[[Category:Kim Possible characters]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Kim Possible objects]]\n[[Category:Machines]]"
