They are the animals that reside in [[Pride Lands]].\n\nDuring the reign of [[Scar]], due to the overhunting of [[The Hyena Clan]], the animals left the [[Pride Lands]] and as the rightful king [[Simba]] returns and defeats his uncle, the herds come back.\n\n== Background ==\n<tabber>\nLions =\n{{Main|Pridelanders}}\n|-|Elephants =\n[[File:MaTemboHerd-LionGuard.jpg|thumb|220px|left]]\nElephants appear in the [[Pride Lands]], led by [[Ma Tembo]] and speak their own language, Elephantese (which Simba has a hard time speaking) alongside having a deep care for song.\n\nAfter Scar's treacherous reign ended, Ma Tembo's father [[Aminifu]] returned first to the [[Pride Lands]] leading to the other animals of the Pride Lands to also come back.\n\nSome Members of the Elephants Are:\n* [[Ma Tembo]] (leader)\n* [[Aminifu]] (former leader)\n* [[Zito]]\n* Mtoto\n* Mtoto's Mother\n* Zigo\n\n|-|Hippopotamuses = \n[[File:LG.TFOMG 02|thumb|left|220px]]\nHippopotamuses also appear in several groups in the [[Pride Lands]], some led by [[Basi]], the father of [[Beshte]], who is strongest of the patrol group, [[Lion Guard]]. They are also shown, other than [[Basi's Pod]] to have a singing group called The Bellow Fellows.\n\nIn ''[[The Rise of Makuu]]'' [[Basi's Pod]] are kicked out of Big Springs by [[Makuu]] the new crocodile leader, though after intervention from the [[Lion Guard]], [[Makuu's Float]] leaves Big Springs and return it to the hippopotamuses.\n\nSome Members of the Hippopotamuses Are:\n* [[Basi's Pod]]\n* [[Basi]] (leader)\n* [[Beshte]]\n* The Bellow Fellows\n*Kiali\n*Kulu (mentioned only)\n\n|-|Giraffes =\n[[File:The-kupatana-celebration-hd (422).png|thumb|left|220px]]\nGiraffes also appears, led by [[Twiga]]. They are shown bowing at [[Simba]]'s presentation and also are shown attending several celebrations.\n\nAt the Savanah Summit, Twiga joined up with [[Vuruga Vuruga]] to trap Makuu (who they didn't like as he is a crocodile), however with some play by [[Kion]] they both admit and joyous to see him alive.\n\nSome Members of Giraffes Are:\n* [[Twiga]] (leader)\n* [[Shingo]]\n* [[Juhudi]]\n\n|-|Crocodiles =\n{{Main|Crocodiles (The Lion King)}}\n{{Main|Makuu's Float}}\n\n|-|Antelopes =\n[[File:Beshte-and-the-hippo-lanes (137).png|thumb|left|220px]]\nMany species of antelope also appear, with the sable antelopes led by [[Bupu]]. Although the [[Pridelanders]] eat the antelope, upon the lion's death they become the grass with the antelope eating the grass, connecting them both within the Circle of Life, with [[Mufasa]] using the phrase to teach is son, a young Simba.\n\nThe sable antelopes shown to be rather stubborn (espeically Bupu) such as when the [[Lion Guard]] ([[Fuli]] mostly) tell them how to stay safe, they refuse. They are also shown in the original film with lighter skin, though in ''[[The Lion Guard]]'' they are shown darker.\n\nSome Members of the Sable Antelope Are:\n* Bupu's Herd\n* [[Bupu]]\n* [[Boboka]]\n* Boboka's Son\n* Mzhana\n\n|-|Zebras =\n[[File:Follow-that-hippo (6).png|thumb|220px|left]]\nZebras also appear and they are led in different herds. There is [[Dhahabu]]'s herd, [[Muhimu]]'s herd and [[Thurston]]'s herd.\n\nThey are shown to have the catchphrase of ''\"Panic and Run!\"'', and like the antelope, they are shown to be very stubborn, not instantly willing to listen to the [[Lion Guard]].\n\nSome Members of the Zebras Are:\n* [[Dhahabu]]\n* [[Muhimu]]\n* [[Thurston]]\n* Their herds\n* Hamu\n* Kwato\n* Raha\n* Starehe\n\n|-|Buffalos =\n[[File:Baboons (473).png|thumb|left|200px]]\nBuffalos also appear and they are lead by [[Vuruga Vuruga]]. They are shown to be decently to be alligned with the other animla, all having a distain for Makuu.\n\nDuring the Savanah Summit, Vuruga Vuruga along with [[Twiga]] tried to get [[Makuu]] by trapping him in a hole, however Kion finds them out and are joyous to find out that Makuu wasn't dead and that he had lived.\n</tabber>\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[The Lion King]]''===\nThe Pride Animals are first seen during the ''[[Circle of Life]]'' sequence. They approach [[Pride Rock]] to attend the birth of [[Simba]], the son of King [[Mufasa]] and Queen [[Sarabi]]. They are shown ecstatic when [[Rafiki]] presents Simba, giving the future king cheers of joy. They are then seen bowing, respecting the future king and his family.\n\n{{Quote|Yes, Simba, but let me explain. When we die, our bodies become the grass. And the antelope eat the grass. And so we are all connected in the great Circle of Life.|Mufasa lecturing Simba on the Lion's and the Antelope's relationship}}\nThe leaping antelope are then seen while [[Mufasa]] lectures Simba on the relationship of the Lion's and the Antelope's relationship, stating that they are connected in the Circle of Life. Upon [[Zazu]]'s arrival, he gives the morning report, mentioning the bees, leopards, baboons, elephants, and cheetahs, among other animals (in the Special Edition version during the musical number \"[[The Morning Report]]\", he mentions the chimpanzees, giraffes, elephants, crocodiles, hornbills, vultures, buffaloes, warthogs, flamingos, secretary birds, and beetles), though it is interrupted by Mufasa teaching Simba to pounce, and later with [[Gopher (The Lion King)|Gopher]] informing them that hyenas are in the [[Pride Lands]]. Simba asks his father to know if he can join with him, but Mufasa tells him to stay in the Pride Lands to keep him safe from the hyenas.\n\n[[File:4k-lionking-animationscreencaps.com-2598.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The Pride Animals making a tower during ''I Just Can't Wait to be King'']]\nSome Pride Animals are then seen at the watering hole as Zazu flies, watching Simba and [[Nala]], they are then subsequently appearing during the song ''[[I Just Can't Wait to Be King]]''. An elephant is seen smacking Zazu upon wiping himself on his ear, flamingos flocked as Simba and Nala run through the flock just as the two cubs later ride on ostriches while Zazu crashes into a rhino. A herd of zebras appreciate Simba and Nala though rejecting Zazu as the cubs pass through a large herd of elephants and other animals. As the animals take part in the chorus, Simba talks to a hippo, which later talks to a giraffe, who tells a monkey in a plan to distract Zazu. Two monkeys grab Zazu as crocodiles sing in chorus with plovers coming out in their mouths. As the monkeys slow down Zazu, giraffes hurl Simba and Nala in the air as the animals make a tower, with them though falling down, and a rhinoceros crushing Zazu, the hornbill seeming unpleased.\n\nLater on after Simba scares off a chameleon with his loud roar thanks to Scar's devious plan, a herd of [[Wildebeests|wildebeest]] are seen stampeding into the [[Gorge|gorge]] (which was caused by [[Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed]] under the orders of [[Scar]]), which resulted in Mufasa's death, alongside a young wildebeest, catching up (since he was behind). It is mentioned and seen, that throughout Scar's reign that due to the Hyenas, the land has become unbearable, with there being no food or water, leading to the herds leaving the [[Pride Lands]]. They then appear at the end of the film, during the final scene, the animals have returned to the Pride Lands as Scar's reign has ended and [[Simba]]'s has begun, they are seen attending the presentation of Simba and Nala's cub, [[Kiara]], as doves fly past the two lions with peace restored in the Pride Lands. Rafiki then presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub in front of the animals.\n\n===''[[The Lion King II: Simba's Pride]]''===\n[[File:Lion-king2-disneyscreencaps.com-7018-0.jpg|thumb|240x240px|The Pride Animals in ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride'']]\nThe Pride Animals return for the sequel. They are first seen during the \"[[He Lives in You]]\" sequence. They are seen going once again to Pride Rock to celebrate the birth and presentation of [[Kiara]], and upon her presentation, again receiving a tremendous applause.\n\nDuring [[Kovu]] and Kiara's meeting, [[Crocodiles (The Lion King)|crocodiles]] attack them, with them (with teamwork) escape them, though their parents then confront each other and one another.{{Quote|Tears of pain, tears of joy, one thing nothing can destroy is our pride deep inside We are one|Simba lecturing Kiara on Pride}}The Pride Animals then appear, such as children in their parents as Simba lectures Kiara while he sings [[We Are One]], such as a baby antelope, failing to walk being helped by his mother, teaching Kiara a lesson.\n\nYears later, and during Kiara's failed hunt on a group of topi, she was forced to flee from a fire (started by [[Nuka]] and [[Vitani]] as part of [[Zira|Zira's]] plan for [[Kovu]] to infiltrate Simba's pride) along with the topi, flocks of egrets, and a pair of zebras.\n\nLater the next day, Kiara and Kovu help [[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]] chase off flocks of spotted thick-knees that were eating Timon and Pumbaa's bugs with their roars until they run into a crash of rhinoceroses that defended the thick-knees and charged after them until they hid from the crash. Pride Animals are seen at [[Pride Rock]], though not for celebration, as they assist in the exile of Kovu, telling him that he is not one of them (with gazelles, giraffes, zebras, and a hippo singing, snakes hissing and snapping, ostriches pecking him, monkeys throwing stones, and marabou storks dive bombing). Subsequently after Kiara escapes to be with Kovu, animals in couples are seen, bringing them back together.\n\nWhen the Outsiders and Pridelanders prepare for war, groups of guineafowl, zebras, gazelles, topi, okapis, and giraffes evacuate the area that will be the battlefield while vultures circle in the sky for the aftermath. After the war, the death of [[Zira]], and when the [[Outsiders]] rejoining the Pride Lands, the Pride Animals are seen attending the wedding ceremony of Kiara and Kovu, cheering.\n\n===''[[The Lion King 1\u00bd]]''===\n[[File:Looking at Pumbaa.jpg|thumb|240x240px|The Pride Animals staring at Pumbaa in ''The Lion King ''1\u00bd|left]]\nThe Pride Animals also appear in the midquel, thought mostly throughout the begining. They are first seen when [[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]] are watching the original, with the iconic shots of the rhino, antelope, meerkat, cheetah, and marabou storks.\n\nThey then appear as they are all gathered at Pride Rock to celebrate Simba's birth, with Timon and Pumbaa needing to cross to the other side for there dream home, with Pumbaa letting out gas, causing some animals to faint and others to bow thinking the former were doing the same.\n\nThey then appear as Timon and Pumbaa wake up, realizing they have noisy neighbors, with them seeing the animals making a tower out of themselves (this is during \"[[I Just Can't Wait to Be King]]\"), with Timon banging on them to stop, with them all tumbling down on Timon. Afterwards, only the wildebeest from the stampede are seen, with Timon and Pumbaa running away from them, finding [[Hakuna Matata]]. Afterwards, they aren't seen again.\n\n=== ''[[The Lion Guard]]'' ===\n\n=== [[The Lion King (2019 film)|''The Lion King'' (2019)]] ===\n[[File:Lionking2019-animationscreencaps.com-12780.jpg|thumb|243x243px|The Pride Animals in ''The Lion King'' (2019 film)]]\nThe Pride Animals also appear in the 2019 CGI remake, with the same role as they had in the original film, first appearing in the [[Circle of Life]] sequence. Like in the original, they go to [[Pride Rock]] to celebrate the birth of King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi's son Simba, celebrating upon his presentation.\n\nThe leaping antelope are then seen just like in the original, with Mufasa telling Simba the relationship of the lions and the antelope, with [[Zazu]] coming and telling him the morning report, then finding out that hyenas are in the [[Pride Lands]].\n\nThey then appear during the \"[[I Just Can't Wait to Be King]]\" sequence as Simba and [[Nala]] rush through the Pride Lands, passing through several herds, though unlike the original film, they do not make a tower of themselves and subsequently fall down. Throughout the song, Simba and Nala frolick past three cheetah cubs who want to run like him as their mother watches her cubs passing by, followed by the two passing by a flock of flamingos and trotting by zebras. Later, they arrive by the watering hole facing Zazu who is behind some ostriches to which upon trying to lose him, two ostriches peck at the hornbill to ward him off and later lands on a hippo which submerges as Simba and Nala trot by a rhino calf and its mother to which the two go past by elephants, ostrich chicks, giraffes, wildebeests, kudus, buffaloes, mongooses, and an aardvark. During the plan to distract Zazu, a giraffe uses its tail to get Zazu off its back. Zebra foals trot and follow Simba as hippo calves sing in choir to which the animals race past Simba as they all sing in choir alongside Simba and Nala to which they all pass by a flock of weaverbirds which chase and confuse Zazu.\n\nYears later, the Pride Lands became a deserted wasteland after Scar became the new king of the Pride Lands, allowing lions and hyenas to live together, causing the Circle of Life to be broken in a massive famine. The surviving wildebeests and oryxes in the Pride Lands retreat, due to Scar's tyranny in overhunting much to Sarabi's worry that Scar is destroying the Pride Lands to his destructive plans of overhunting after noticing that Scar delivered an oryx carcass atop Pride Rock.\n\nNoticing of what Scar is doing to the Pride Lands, Nala manages to escape the Pride Lands without getting caught by Scar with help from Zazu. Simba, however, returns to the Pride Lands, confronts and defeats his uncle, and becomes the new king of the Pride Lands in order to take his place as rightful king. Thanks to this, the animals happily return to the Pride Lands and attend the birth of Simba and Nala's newborn cub, alongside Timon, Pumbaa, and the neighboring jungle animals.\n\n==[[The Lion King (musical)|Musical]]==\nBecause the musical productions are based on the original 1994 film, the musical needed the Pride Animals appearing in certain scenes throughout the show. The Pride Animals have been portrayed by numerous actors throughout the show and are prominently featured as background characters. Though they reprise the same role they did for the film, certain scenes not in the film also included Pride Animals.\n\nIn Act One, the animals appear to attend the birth of Simba. Additionally,antelopes appear when Mufasa explains to Simba how the Circle of Life works. Later, antelopes appear during the musical number \"[[The Lioness Hunt]]\" where one of the Pridelander lionesses successfully hunts an antelope to which the song stops when Simba talks to Nala. Like in the film, they participate during \"I Just Can't Wait to Be King\" in a plan to trick Zazu. Additionally after the musical number \"[[He Lives in You|They Live in You]]\", it includes a brief scene where a cheetah encounters a nearby giraffe to which as the giraffe passes by, the cheetah halts as he follows the giraffe just before the scene loops into the part where Scar tells Simba to practice his roar only to cause a wildebeest stampede.\n\nIn the opening of Act Two, a few surviving antelopes are seen leaving the Pride Lands as a deserted wasteland, due to Scar taking over as the new ruler of Pride Rock, to his tyranny. Like in the film, Simba manages to defeat Scar by engaging in combat as the two lions fight to know who is the king; after Scar is defeated, Simba becomes the new king of Pride Rock and the Pride Animals happily return to attend the birth of Simba and Nala's newborn cub. They are then seen during the curtain call where they bow at the audience applauding to the actors for all their hard work in the ''Lion King'' production.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n{{The Lion King}}\n\n[[Category:African characters]]\n[[Category:The Lion King characters]]\n[[Category:The Lion Guard characters]]\n[[Category:Animals]]\n[[Category:Elephants]]\n[[Category:Crocodiles]]\n[[Category:Ostrich]]\n[[Category:Hippopotamuses]]\n[[Category:Giraffes]]\n[[Category:Buffalos]]\n[[Category:Zebras]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Timon & Pumbaa characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]"
