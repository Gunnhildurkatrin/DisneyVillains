He also is very charming, making girls like [[Princess Calla|Calla]] swoon. However, Sir Victor has one dark secret: He is of the infamous Igthorn family, and chose to be \"The White Knight\" to undo the horrible reputation his family has earned. He rides a great steed, Destiny.\n\nIn his first appearance in the episode \"[[The White Knight]]\", [[Duke Igthorn|Sigmund Igthorn]] threatens to slander his brother Sir Victor, unless he aids the [[Ogres]] in capturing [[Dunwyn Castle]], to which Sir Victor reluctantly agrees. Cavin catches Sir Victor in the act, and pleads with the knight to be the hero he has made himself. When Sir Victor realizes the harm Sigmund would bring to the people of Dunwyn, as well as the oppression, Sir Victor then proceeds to sabotage the Ogres, and then take on Duke Igthorn in a swordfight in one of the battlements. \n\nAfter Duke Ightorn is routed, Sir Victor decides to prevent future blackmail by revealing to everyone he is a blood relative of Sigmund Igthorn. While the people of Dunwyn are surprised, [[King Gregor]] immediately says that people must be judged individually, not by family ties. Before leaving, much relieved that there is at least one place with the compassion and wisdom to not hold his family relations against him, Sir Victor rewards Cavin with an award, declaring the page his hero.\n\nIn the episode \"[[Trading Faces (Adventures of the Gummi Bears)|Trading Faces]]\", Sir Victor returns to Dunwyn in order to defend the Castle while an ailing [[Sir Tuxford]] recovers from injuries. Duke Igthorn uses the opportunity to infiltrate the Castle, using his brother's likeness. To that end, the Duke lures Victor on a false emergency to kidnap him and steal his clothes for a disguise, while ordering [[Toadwart]] to kill him and his steed.\n\nFortunately, Toadwart neglects the order to torment Victor and Destiny, allowing [[Gruffi Gummi|Gruffi]] and [[Zummi Gummi|Zummi]] to secretly free him. Thus freed, albiet in his underwear, Victor meets up with Cavin and gets the idea of turning the tables on his evil brother by impersonating him. So disguised, Victor finally defeats Sigmund. With his duty done, Victor takes his leave of Dunwyn.\n\n==Appearances==\n*\"[[The White Knight]]\"\n*\"[[Trading Faces (Adventures of the Gummi Bears)|Trading Faces]]\"\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n{{Adventures of the Gummi Bears}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Character stubs]]\n[[Category:Adventures of the Gummi Bears characters]]\n[[Category:Knights]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:German characters]]\n[[Category:Twins and Triplets]]"
