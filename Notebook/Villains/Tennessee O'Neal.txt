He plays the \"One String Thang\" and is a soulful singer and dynamic force onstage. Offstage, he is an emotional, nervous wreck.\n\n==Role in the film==\nHe quit the band when the love of his life Trixie left him and started dating a panda instead ([[Fred Bedderhead]]: \"What's with the pandas? They get everything.\"). He then tried to be a marriage counselor, but he broke down in tears over losing Trixie during his sessions with clients. Even though Tennessee agreed to rejoin the band for Beary, his anxiety attacks about seeing Trixie again nearly killed him, until they reunite at last.\n{{DEFAULTSORT:O'Neal, Tennessee}}\n\n{{The Country Bears}}\n[[Category:Bears]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Country Bear characters]]\n[[Category:The Country Bears]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]"
