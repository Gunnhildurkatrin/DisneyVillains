The Blind Witch reveals her hatred for Aunt Em and tells them where to find her diner. She greets them there, and Emma tells her they are trying to help Dorothy, as she needs True Love's Kiss to wake her from the sleeping curse. She asks Aunt Em to blow a kiss into a bottle. However, after Aunt Em takes the bottle, she melts into a puddle. Shocked, the heroes question what happened, and [[Hades]] reveals himself, explaining that he laced her soup with water from the River of Lost Souls. He wipes her up with a dish rag and drains her into a jar. Because of this, her headstone in the Underworld cemetery becomes cracked, indicating she's gone to a worse place. Hades later empties her into the River with the rest of the lost souls.\n\n{{Oz}}\n{{Once Upon a Time}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Aunts]]\n[[Category:Oz characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Return to Oz characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Once Upon a Time characters]]"
