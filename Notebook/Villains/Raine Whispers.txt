They are the Head Witch of the Bard Coven, as well as the leader of a rebellion against the Emperor's rule.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality and traits===\nRaine is known to be a shy person. They get stage fright and get nervous when making public speeches. However, they're not afraid to stand up for what they believe in, even if it means risking their own life. They disapprove of [[Emperor Belos]] forcing witches to join covens and stealing magic, which was why they worked hard to become a Coven Head and find people who wanted to change things, starting the small rebellion known as the Bards Against the Throne (aka the BATs).  Before, they never could overcome their fears until they met [[Eda Clawthorne|Eda]], who encouraged them to face their fears. The two had known each other since they were students at [[Hexside School of Magic and Demonics|Hexside]]. They even dated for a while, until Raine decided to break up on the day they joined the Bard Coven, due to Eda's tendency to push people away.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Raine Whispers is Disney's first non-binary character as they go by they/them pronouns. They are also voiced by trans and non-binary actor Avi Roque.<ref>[https://www.out.com/television/2021/7/23/owl-house-introducing-new-nonbinary-character-show The Owl House Is Introducing a New Nonbinary Character to the Show]</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nThe Owl House S2 (19).png|Raine on the left\nEda's Requiem (23).jpg\nThe Owl House S2 (13).png\nEda's Requiem (32).jpg|\"Eda!
