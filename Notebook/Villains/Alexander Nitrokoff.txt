He would come to die through mysterious means, last being observed standing atop a lit keg of dynamite while holding a paper of unknown contents and dressed in his undergarments.  Following his untimely demise, the ambassador would become one of the 999 spirits haunting the mansion.\n\n===Development History===\nThe name Alexander Nitrokoff originates from an unused piece of dialogue by [[Xavier Atencio|X. Atencio]] which would have been said by the [[Ghost Host]] and identified him as, \"''Alexander Nitrokoff, an anarchist who came to us with a bang one night''\".  This was ultimately cut and of dubious canonicity given that this same spiel identified [[Constance Hatchaway]] as, \"Widow Abigail Patecleaver\".  However, the name Alexander Nitrokoff has been frequently used to identify the character, notably in merchandise such as [[vinylmation]] and in comic-books.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===The Haunted Mansion===\nNitrokoff's only appearance in this attraction is as one of four portraits in the stretching room, found alongside those of [[Tightrope Walker|Sally Slater]], Constance Hatchaway and three men in quicksand.  While first appearing proud and distinguished, the portrait stretches to reveal him standing in his underwear atop a lit barrel of explosives and about to meet his final fate.\n\n===Main Street Penny Arcade===\nA tarot card made in the likeness of each of the four stretching room paintings in the possession of the fortune-teller [[Esmeralda (Disneyland)|Esmeralda]], including one of Alexander.\n\n==Other Appearances==\n\n==== ''[[Muppets Haunted Mansion]]'' ====\nAlexander Nitrokoff appears in the Disney+ special and is played by [[Crazy Harry]].\n\n===Video-Games===\n\n====[[Disney Crossy Road]]====\nAlexander is a playable character in the Haunted Mansion levels of this game where he is identified as, \"'''The Orator'''\".\n\n===Printed-Materials===\n\n====The Ghost Gallery====\nThe Ghost Gallery was a backstory for the Haunted Mansion made by [[Walt Disney World]] cast-members in the 1990s.  While it is not canonical, it has altered many elements of Haunted Mansion cannon to fit in with it.\n\nIn this story, the dynamite man was named '''Ambassador Edward Gracey of Burma''' and he was a foreign ambassador who was the brother of one [[George Hightower|George Gracey, Sr.]] who owned the Haunted Mansion in New York.  He was the uncle to George Sr.'s son who would become [[Master Gracey]].  While he aided the young master in obtaining many artifacts for the mansion, the two would have a falling out after assisting George Jr. in obtaining an Egyptian mummy.  Edward would die in [[1937]] when revolutionary guerrilla soldiers blew up his embassy during a banquet.  In this story he was also the father of Eddy Foster, a servant of the Haunted Mansion who is one of the quicksand men.\n\n====[[Haunted Mansion (comic book)]]====\nIn this non-canon comic-books, the dynamite man character was a New Orleans resident named '''Steven''' who had impaired sight.  He was invited to the mansion by its undead [[Captain Gore|Captain]] in hopes of adding his soul to their quota.  When he lost his glasses, he would stumble into the mansion's gunpowder room and light a keg of explosives, believing it to be a candle.\n\n====The Haunted Mansion: Frights of Fancy====\nAlexander appears in this comic where he is explicitly identified as Alexander Nitrokoff.  He is one of several spirits in the manor assembled by Constance Hatchaway to try and make it scarier with the aid of a mortal guest.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"200\" spacing=\"small\">\n28534949 5.jpg\nNitrokoffDavis.png\nDisney-haunted-mansion-man-barrel.jpg\n12 7 69 HMStretch1.jpg\n12 7 69 HMStretch2.jpg\n90.jpeg\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Haunted Mansion}}{{Disney Crossy Road}}\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Crossy Road characters]]\n[[Category:The Haunted Mansion characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Spirits]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Comic characters]]\n[[Category:Politicians]]"
