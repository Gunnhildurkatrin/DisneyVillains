She\u00a0is a very beautiful and mysterious young woman. She is very poetic, regularly performing at the Bean Scene (a coffee shop on the campus where [[Max Goof|Max]], [[Bobby Zimuruski|Bobby]] and [[P.J.]] go to college). She is also, however, a kind individual, who is not afraid to stand up for herself or her friends (for example when she retorted angrily to [[Bradley Uppercrust III|Bradley]] after he insulted her). She also shows strong feelings for P.J., and becomes his love interest in the film.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nThe Beret Girl is tall and thin, very beautiful, sporting an hourglass figure. She appears to be an anthropomorphized dog, similar to Max and the gang. She has long maroon hair, green eyes with light purple eyeshadow, a small black nose, and big lips with dark red lipstick. Clothing wise, she dresses like a beatnik; Sporting a black beret (hence her moniker), turtleneck, pants and shoes, all colored black. Her makeup and her hair covering her left eye are similar to [[Jessica Rabbit]]'s face from [[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]].\n\n==Role in the film==\nShe is first seen when she performed at the Bean Scene, a coffee shop where Max, P.J., and Bobby hang out. She performed poetically to the crowd of customers, who are all fans of her. After her performance, both Bobby and P.J. begin to harbor a secret crush on her.\n\nShe is later seen again in the coffee shop when Max and Bradley start to get into an altercation. The latter insults her in front of everyone, which she retorts angrily to by poetically insulting him back, referring to him as \"the eyelash in her eye\" and snapping rhythmically (with the other customers who join in) to make him irritated. This gets to him, and he yells at them to stop. He makes a deal with Max before leaving, and she praises Max for standing up for himself and her.\n\nShe appears again at the nightclub, where she is amazed by P.J., who speaks poetically about how fat people are looked down upon in society. This impresses her, and she and P.J. dance together (this marks the start of their relationship and P.J's newfound confidence).\n\nShe is last seen with P.J. at the end of the film when Goofy graduates and heads home with Sylvia. She also appears in the end credits, dancing along with the rest of the main cast.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\">\nProfile_-_Beret_Girl.jpg\nBeret_Girl_an_extremely_goofy_movie.png|Beret Girl performing her poetry at the Bean Scene.\nExgoofy-disneyscreencaps.com-2263.jpg\nExgoofy-disneyscreencaps.com-3972.jpg\nExgoofy-disneyscreencaps.com-3975.jpg\nExgoofy-disneyscreencaps.com-3996.jpg\nExgoofy-disneyscreencaps.com-4023.jpg\nExgoofy-disneyscreencaps.com-4069.jpg\nExgoofy-disneyscreencaps.com-4277.jpg\nExgoofy-disneyscreencaps.com-4292.jpg\nExgoofy-disneyscreencaps.com-4299.jpg\nExtremely-goofy-disneyscreencaps.com-4491.jpg\nExtremely-goofy-disneyscreencaps.com-8618.jpg\nBeret Girl an extremely goofy movie ending.JPG\nAn-Extremely-Goofy-Movie-girl.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Goof Troop}}\n__FORCETOC__\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Goofy Movie Characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Dancers]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]"
