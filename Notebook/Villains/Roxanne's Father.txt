His relationship with her comes off as that of a pet and owner, with her playing the former and him playing the latter. Because of this, she often corrects him whenever he is being overprotective.\n\nHe is only seen twice in the film; first when Max comes to tell Roxanne that he can't come to [[Stacey]]'s party because he was forced into going fishing with his [[Goofy|father]], and is seen watching them through the mail slot, but stops when Roxanne spots him. The second time is at the end of the film when Max comes to apologize to Roxanne for making up the story of Goofy knowing [[Powerline]]. In this instance, he was seen wearing a towel and a shower cap, implying that Max rang the doorbell while he was bathing.\n\nHe never speaks, only growls.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nImagerahf.jpg|Roxanne's father meets Max\nImagerfood.jpg|Roxanne's father having his bath time disturbed\n</gallery>\n\n{{Goof Troop}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Goofy Movie Characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Widows/Widowers]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]"
