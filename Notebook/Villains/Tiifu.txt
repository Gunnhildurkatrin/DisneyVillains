She, along with [[Zuri]], is a friend of Simba and Nala's daughter, [[Kiara]].\n\n==Background==\n=== Personality===\nTiifu is kind, caring, patient, follows the rules, and trusts the judgment of her friends. She is rather curious, going so far as to ask questions even after being warned against doing so. She admires Kiara and holds her title as future queen in high regard. She also seems to be quite defensive of her friendship with Kiara as she became jealous when Fuli went to Kiara's side when tracking gazelles.\n\nAlthough Tiifu is intelligent, like her best friend Kiara, she is also arrogant, immature, cheerful, carefree, laid-back, and reckless.\n\n==Role in the series==\n===''[[The Lion Guard: Return of the Roar]]''===\nTiifu first appears when she and Kiara see Zuri trying to pry her claws out of a log (after attempting to sharpen them) and sees her being freed by [[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]]. She later listens to [[Bunga]] when he reveals that [[Kion]] is to lead the new [[Lion Guard]] with Bunga being the first member picked. Tiifu later watches Bunga sing \"[[Zuka Zama]]\".\n\nTiifu is later seen with Kiara when they join Simba and [[Zazu]] when Kiara shows Simba proof that Kion put Bunga in The Lion Guard. Simba thanks, Kiara before sending her and Tiifu to track gazelles while he has a word with Kion.\n\nTiifu and Kiara are later seen tracking a herd of gazelles with Kiara telling Tiifu that they mustn't take more than their fair share as it would break The Circle of Life. After noticing [[Janja]] and [[Janja's Clan|his clan]] invading the [[Pride Lands]], Kiara sends Tiifu to fetch Simba. Tiifu later returns with Simba, Nala and [[Rafiki]] where they watch in horror as Kiara gets caught up in a stampede Janja and his clan have started amongst the gazelles. Luckily, Kion, Bunga and the other Lion Guard members [[Beshte]], [[Fuli]] and [[Ono]] come to Kiara's rescue and get her to safety, to the relief of Tiifu, Simba, and Nala. They then witness in wonder as Kion used the [[Roar of the Elders]] to send Janja back to the [[Outlands]].\n\n===''[[The Lion Guard]]''===\n====\"[[Can't Wait to be Queen]]\"====\nTiifu and Zuri serve as advisors to Kiara after she is made temporary Queen of the Pride Lands when Simba and Nala leave to attend Amanifu's funeral. However, when Kiara leaves to have a supposed peace treaty with Janja, Tiifu and Zuri stay behind, believing that their friend would be fine on her own, causing them to be criticized by Kion, who leaves with the Lion Guard to save his sister.\n\n====\"[[Fuli's New Family]]\"====\nTiifu joins Zuri, Kiara, and Nala in tracking gazelles in preparation for Kiara's first hunt. Tiifu becomes jealous when [[Fuli]] sides up next to Kiara, believing that Fuli is trying to be Kiara's new \"bestie\".\n\n====\"[[Baboons!]]\"====\nTiifu and Zuri try to make Kiara look her best for the Royal Buffalo Wallow, which she is to open on Simba and Nala's behalf. However, the trio ends up stranded on an island when a flood strikes the Pride Lands. Unlike Kiara, Tiifu and Zuri are not very concerned about getting off the island. Instead, they try out various beauty remedies while Kiara tries to get them off the island. With the help of the Lion Guard, the trio gets off the island and go to the wallow.\n\n====\"[[The Rise of Scar]]\"====\nTiifu is seen drinking with Kiara, Zuri, and other [[Pride Animals]] until Kion and Fuli come by with a group of exhausted hyraxes and Kiara gently pushes them aside to let them drink. Then, she meets with the rest of the pride and when Tiifu hears that [[Ma Tembo]] is still searching for water and Zuri asks what's the importance of it. Kiara reminds her that searching for water will matter especially if Pride Landers are thirsty, then she meets the next Royal Mjuzi and Rafiki's apprentice [[Makini]]. As Makini and Kiara leave to help in Ma Tembo's search, Zuri and Tiifu try to follow them, believing themselves to be her true advisers, but they are stopped by Nala as she wants Makini and Kiara to have the chance to get to know each other. So Nala offers to let Zuri and Tiifu spend the day at Pride Rock with her and the two agree.\n\n====\"[[The Ukumbusho Tradition]]\" ====\nTiifu and the rest of Simba's Pride watches the Ukumbusho Tradition.\n\n====\"[[Timon and Pumbaa's Christmas]]\"====\nTiifu performers in the Christmas show that Bunga puts on for Timon and Pumbaa.\n\n====\"[[The Underground Adventure]]\" ====\nTiifu and Zuri call for The Lion Guard after their appearances are brought out by the Dry Season. Kiara and Nala scold the two for calling the Lion Guard for a non-emergency. Nala makes it clear that the two lion cubs understand to only shout for help, if this is really necessary. Beshte suggests that the two go to the hot mud pots at the edge of the Pride Lands, to which they agree and invite Kiara to join them, as they rarely spend time together due to Kiara's royal duties. Nala agrees to let Kiara go, but having heard about [[Scar]]'s return sends Kion and Bunga with the girls for protection. After arriving at the hot mud pots, Tiifu and Zuri relax. After [[Mzingo]] tarts a fire nearby on Scar's orders, Tiifu, Zuri, Kiara, Kion and Bunga take cover in [[Muhanga and Muhangus|Muhanga's]] burrow. Kion tells the group that they can wait until the fire ends in a day or so, what causes Tiifu to panic and try to leave.\n\nWhen questioned by Kiara on her behavior, Tiifu reveals that she is afraid of the dark. They attempt to find a tunnel to lead them back to Pride Rock. The group later encounter a golden mole named [[Kuchimba]]  who at first attacks them, thinking that they are stealing his tunnels. Upon discovering that the group are not stealing his tunnels but are trying to get home, he offers to help. Tiifu asks Kuchimba if he ever gets scared of the dark, to which the mole replies that there's \"[[Nothin' to Fear Down Here]]\" and how the noises and things she has been seeing are just her imagination. Kuchimba leaves after leading the group to the main tunnel, much to Tiifu's disappointment.\n\nAfter finding three tunnels with no indication as to which is the main one, the group encounters [[Thurston]] who had wandered in. They believe that the tunnel he came through was the main one. Eventually, the group reaches the exit which causes Tiifu to run on ahead, drawing criticism from Thurston. When Thurston starts to panic, Tiifu returns to calm him down, stating that \"there's nothing to fear down here\". Tiifu offers to escort Thurston out as his friend and even ups the role to best friend, which Thurston requests.\n\nAfter Tiifu is praised for her bravery, Thurston ends up going into another cave. When he cries for help, Tiifu goes to help her new best friend.\n\n====\"[[The Queen's Visit]]\" ====\n[[Dhahabu]] and her herd come into the Pride Lands and Tiifu becomes a temporary guard. Soon [[Reirei's Pack]] comes and tries to attack Dhahabu. However Fuli and the Lion Guard stop them. Dhahabu asks for Fuli, Tiifu, and Zuri to be her guards forever. Tiifu and Zuri are both disappointed at this, telling Fuli that their real job is to protect Kiara, who will need their help someday. The jackals soon came back again and this time they came with a couple of crocodiles [[Starehe]] and [[Raha]] came to save them and Dhahabu saw them and was impressed. She made them be her permanent guards. That night Dhahabu talks to the Pridelanders about sharing her Watering Hole with them forever.\n\n====\"[[Battle for the Pride Lands]]\"====\nTiifu says goodbye to the Lion Guard as they make their way to the [[Tree of Life (The Lion Guard)|Tree of Life]].\n\n====\"[[Return to the Pride Lands]]\"====\nTiifu watches Kion's coronation with the rest of her pride including [[Kovu]].\n\n== Relationships==\n\n===Friends===\n====[[Zuri]]====\n[[File:Imagetlgzuritiifu.png|thumb|240px]][[File:Kiara_and_friends.png|thumb|240px]]Zuri and Tiifu are besties. They always like to have fun and laugh with each other. They always help Kiara out with her princess and queen duties.{{-}}\n\n====[[Kiara]]====\nTiifu and Kiara are besties. In \"[[The Lion Guard: Return of the Roar]]\" Tiifu and Kiara are going hunting until Janja's clan  came into the Pride Lands. Tiifu went to go get Simba while Kiara stayed and watch. Tiifu even calls herself ''Kiara's royal advisor''.\n\n====[[Kuchimba]]====\nWhen the golden mole was screaming Tiifu thought he was scary until he decides to show the group home. Tiifu asked him how he can see in the dark? Kuchimba answers that he can feel the vibrations. Tiifu tells him that she thinks she sees and hears things in the dark. He says that it's her imagination and she tells that there's [[Nothing to Fear Down Here]].\n\n====[[Thurston]]====\nWhen Thurston finds out that he's in a dark cave he starts to panic and run. Tiifu sees him and goes back to calm him down. Tiifu explains that there's nothing scary in the dark. The two start to become best friends and they walk out of the cave together.\n\n====[[Dhahabu]]====\nTiifu loved hanging out with Dhahabu and being her guard for a day. However, she didn't wanna be her guard forever.\n\n===Acquaintances===\n====[[Kion]]====\n\nTiifu, like Kion is a member of the Pridelanders and is best friends with his sister Kiara. The two clashed in \"Can't Wait to be Queen\" when Tiifu, along with Zuri, served as an adviser to Kiara during her temporary queenship and made a snide remark at Kion because he wasn't as quick thinking as Kiara and she immaturely relished in her \"power\" as an advisor. Later, Kion was disgusted with Tiifu and Zuri when they allowed Kiara to meet with Janja alone as they believed she would be okay on her own.\n\nHowever in \"Fuli's New Family,\" Kion is seen smiling at Tiifu as she practices hunting, perhaps hinting that Kion and Tiifu made up with each other after he and Kiara returned to Pride Rock.\n\n====[[Bunga]]====\nTiifu and Bunga are on good terms. When Bunga told Timon and Pumbaa about 'Zuka Zama' Tifu asked him what that meant. In \"The Underground Adventure\" when they were all trapped in caves Bunga kept on scaring her but he didn't mean it. While trying to find Muhangus Tiifu didn't want Kion and Bunga to leave. She felt safer in the dark with Bunga since he was a Lion Guard member and he could protect her.\n\n====[[Timon]] And [[Pumbaa]]====\nTimon, Pumbaa and Tiifu are on good terms. Tiifu performed in \"[[The Twelve Ways of Christmas]]\" as 6 lions leaping.\n\n====[[Simba]] And [[Nala]]====\nTiifu is on good terms with Simba and Nala. She is always seen with them.\n\n====[[Makini]]====\nTiifu is rather indifferent to Makini. Shortly after being introduced, she showed incredible jealousy when Kiara addressed the mandrill as her ''future advisor'', prompting an angry response from her, who claimed that she was her royal advisor. This animosity was soon dropped when Nala offered to spend time with her instead.\n\n====[[Fuli]]====\n\nFuli and Tiifu are on good terms. At first, Tiifu becomes jealous of her in \"[[Fuli's New Family]]\" complaining about Fuli hunting beside Kiara and thinking that she is Kiara new best friend. In \"[[The Queen's Visit]]\" the girls worked together to protect Queen Dhahahbu however Tiifu and Zuri didn't want to be Dhahahbu's guards forever. They explained to Fuli that they couldn't leave Kiara since she's their best friend. When the jackals came to eat Dhahahbu, Tiifu and Zuri asked Fuli about what to do to help. She told them to stay by the queen. They all become good friends after that.\n\n=== Enemies ===\n====[[Reirei's Pack]]====\nTiifu hates Reirei's Pack since they tried to eat her along with Dhahabu.\n\n====[[Kiburi's Float]]====\nTiifu hates Kiburi's Floats since they tried to eat her along with Dhahabu.\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*Tiifu's Voice Actress Sarah Hyland also voiced [[Theresa Fowler]] on the [[Disney XD]] show ''[[Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja]]''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nImagetlgzuritiifu.png|Tiifu comforting Zuri\nImagetlgzktk.png|Tiifu, Zuri, Kiara, and Kion\nImagetlgztkb.png|Tiifu, Zuri, Kiara, and Bunga\nimagetlgrotrt+t+z.png|Tiifu, Timon, and Zuri\nImagetlgroftrkktzbtp.jpeg|Tiifu with Kiara, Zuri, Kion, Bunga, Timon, and Pumbaa\nimagetlgrotrt+n+swihaktias.png|Tiifu, Nala, and Simba watching in horror as Kiara is caught in a gazelle stampede\nImagetlgktrsn.png|Tiifu, Kiara, Nala, Simba, and Rafiki\nImageknsktlgtzwmapm.png|Tiifu watching Makuu and Pua's mashindano\nImagetlgcwtbqztaka.png\nImagetlgcwtbqzuritiifu.png\nImagetlgfnfnkktzf.jpeg|Tiifu, Kiara, and Zuri being taught to track gazelles by Nala\nImagetlgfnfknktzsmile.jpeg\nImagetlgfnfnkktzf1.jpeg\nBaboons (159).png\nBaboons (468).png\nKion's Wedding Friends.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Lion King}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Lions]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:African characters]]\n[[Category:The Lion Guard characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Hunters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
