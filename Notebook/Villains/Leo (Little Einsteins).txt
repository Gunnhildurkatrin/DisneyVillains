At 6 years old, he and June are the oldest members of the group. He is the Little Einsteins' leader and the one who pilots Rocket. He is also [[Annie (Little Einsteins)|Annie]]'s older brother.\n\n==Background==\n===Appearance===\nLeo has red spiky hair, large teal glasses, and green eyes. He wears a black short-sleeved t-shirt which has an orange streak, orange cargo shorts with large pockets, white socks, and orange and black sneakers.\n===Friends===\nHis friends are [[June (Little Einsteins)|June]], [[Annie (Little Einsteins)|Annie]] (his sister), [[Quincy (Little Einsteins)|Quincy]], and [[Rocket (Little Einsteins)|Rocket]]. He also has other friends, but some are not human (for example, one of his friends is a bumblebee from Africa).\u00a0\n\n==Disney Parks==\nLeo made an appearance as a puppet in [[Disney Junior - Live on Stage!]] (back when the Little Einsteins segment was part of the show) located in the [[Animation Courtyard]] at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]].\n\nAlso, he made meet-and-greets with people, just like the other Little Einsteins, except Rocket.\n\n==Trivia==\n*He is the only character on ''Little Einsteins'' to wear glasses.\n*His skills with the baton include the ability to conduct animals (seen in ''[[Our Huge Adventure|Our <s>Big</s> Huge Adventure]]'', where he conducts cows and The Song of the Unicorn).\n*His main talent is conducting and his most precious object is his conductor's baton; he never leaves home without it.\n*Although he is only six years old, he is tall, in fact, he is taller than Quincy and his little sister Annie (she is the smallest). But June is as tall as him, but although she is tall she is small.\n* It has been said that Leo may have a crush on June and vice versa, but not much evidence has been presented to support this.\n** In the episode \"[[Ring Around the Planet]]\", After Leo got Saturn's ring back home, June walked to him and gave him a big hug; you can see Leo smiling because of the hug. Since good friends hug each other all the time, this is not too much in indicating a crush.\n** June was always the one to comfort Leo when he gets sad, and he has greatly appreciated it.\n** In turn, Leo comforted June when she was feeling down.\n** In \"The Glass Slipper Ball\", Leo complimented on June's dancing skills and told her she was the best dancer he knew. This comment made June blush and she can't stop smiling. Leo also complimented on June's dress that she wore to the ball, which also made June blush. Although this may seem a little bit crush-like, it\u2019s more said and done in a friendly, non-flirtatious manner.\n* In \"[[Rocket's Firebird Rescue]]\", Leo was granted Music Power and may have it permanently.\n* In \"[[A Galactic Goodnight]]\", Leo says that he uses his baton as a nightlight every night, which helps him fall asleep.\n* In the episode \"[[The Christmas Wish]]\", Leo's wish was a new baton head.\n* He is the only character on ''Little Einsteins'' revealed to have a full name: Leonardo.\n** He prefers his friends to call him Leo.\n*He is named after famous conductor [[Leopold Stokowski]] (April 18th, 1882 \u2013 September 13th, 1977) from the Disney Classic Movie of 1940's called \"[[Fantasia]]\".\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"185\">\nLeo ice skating.JPG\nLeo spider halloween.JPG\nAnnie Leo cuddle.png\nLeo conducting Starry Night.jpg\nLeo ringmaster.jpg\nScreenshot 2019-03-14-10-24-41.png\nJune hugging Leo.png\nLogo for Little Einsteins.png\nFile:Little Einsteins - Leo - Render.png\nFile:File 000 (42).png\nLeoLittleEinsteins.png\nFile:6F5FA70A-C3C9-4CE7-A4D3-8520EB119A09.png\n340594803000211.webp\nLeo - Render.png\nDdvwojh-2c22ff6f-7ffd-467d-808b-cfb3883245b9.png\n5EA5BF15-E23E-4C92-A1D8-372841639E50.png\nLittle-Einsteins-Leo-the-music-conductor-805x1024.png\nDisney+LittleEinsteins.png\nEinsteins.jpg\nLittleEinsteinsSeason2.jpg\nFile:Little-Einsteins-on-stage-1532736446.jpg\nLittleEinsteinsDisneyPlus.jpg\nLittle Einsteins in space.png\nLeo smiles.jpg\nPirate Leo1.jpeg\nPirate Leo.jpg\nLeo annie 213321.png\nLeo and annie.png\nLeo and annie walking.png\nLeo and annie 12332.png\nLeo 321321.png\nA3A98523-F74D-4F9D-819E-1C99DFD4EB60.jpeg|Leo and June\n</gallery>\n\n{{Little Einsteins}}\n[[it:Leo (Little Einsteins)]]\n[[ja:\u30ec\u30aa (\u30ea\u30c8\u30eb\u30fb\u30a2\u30a4\u30f3\u30b7\u30e5\u30bf\u30a4\u30f3)]]\n[[Category:Playhouse Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Little Einsteins characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Captains]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Children's television]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:Little Einsteins]]\n[[Category:Disney Live! characters]]\n[[Category:Astronauts]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]"
