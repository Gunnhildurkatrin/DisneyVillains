She also helped [[Phineas Flynn]] win the Swamp Oil 500. [[Isabella Garcia-Shapiro]] thanked her for a job well done and complimented her on adding the bow to the Team [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]] Race car during the pit-stop (\u201c[[The Fast and the Phineas]]\u201d). She also sings in [[S'Winter (song)|S\u2019Winter]] (\u201c[[S'Winter]]\u201d). In a deep voice, she counts down the blastoff of [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]] and [[Ferb Fletcher|Ferb]]\u2019s rocket when they visit their star (\u201c[[Out to Launch (Phineas and Ferb)|Out to Launch]]\u201d). She appears to have a large IQ, having to repeat her statements due to the others not understanding what she had said, and saying words that no one else in the room knows (\u201c[[Bubble Boys]]\u201d, \u201c[[Isabella and the Temple of Sap]]\u201d).\n==Appearance==\n[[File:Gretchen_reading.jpg|thumb|250px]]\nGretchen has short auburn hair, blue eyes with glasses, and wears her uniform with a large collar, bell-shaped sleeves, and a red belt around her skirt, and low-top shoes, and is slender. In winter, however, she ties her hair into a mid-length ponytail with red elastic, and wears an orange and red long-sleeved shirt with brown pants, and orange slip-on shoes.\n==Known patches==\n*Help Thy Neighbor Patch (About 52 as of \u201c[[Isabella and the Temple of Sap]]\u201d)\n*Aquatic Safety Patch (\u201c[[Lawn Gnome Beach Party of Terror]]\u201d)\n*Sewing Patch (\u201c[[Run Away Runway]]\u201d)\n*Tent Pitching Patch, Marshmallow Patch (\u201c[[Get That Bigfoot Outa My Face!]]\u201d)\n*Aeronautic Patch (\u201c[[De Plane!

In the instances where Isabella does not actually listen to what Phineas is saying to her due to drifting off into fantasies, Gretchen repeats it for her convenience. (\u201c[[Isabella and the Temple of Sap]]\u201d)\n\n===[[Fireside Girls|The Other Fireside Girls]]===\nGretchen along with the other Fireside Girls gladly help out with [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]]\u2019s and [[Ferb Fletcher|Ferb]]\u2019s Big Ideas. The other Fireside Girls sometimes have difficulty understanding Gretchen first time stating something so Gretchen repeats it in a different way to get her statement across. (\u201c[[Bubble Boys]]\u201d)\n\n===[[Phineas Flynn]] and [[Ferb Fletcher]]===\nGretchen frequently participates in their Big Ideas. Phineas and Ferb will sometimes help them get a specific patch(es). Gretchen appears to have a bit of a crush on Ferb. Other than this, nothing is currently known about Gretchen\u2019s relationships with the two.\n\n==Other appearances==\n===Video games===\nShe is a seldom-seen character in the Nintendo DS games ''[[Phineas and Ferb (video game)|Phineas and Ferb]]'' and ''[[Phineas and Ferb Ride Again]]''.\n\n===''[[Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension]]''===\n[[File:Alt. Gretchen A2SD.JPG|thumb|250px|Gretchen\u2019s alternate universe counterpart in ''[[Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension]]''.]]\nGretchen is the only [[Firestorm Girls|Firestorm]]/Fireside Girl that has a speaking line in the film. Her line is \u201cI\u2019m on it.\u201d, when the [[Candace Flynn (2nd Dimension)|2nd Dimension Candace]] talks to the 2nd Dimension Gretchen.\n\n===''[[Disney's Phineas and Ferb: The Best LIVE Tour Ever!]]''===\nCurrently, Gretchen\u2019s only appearance in \u201clive\u201d form was in ''[[Disney's Phineas and Ferb: The Best LIVE Tour Ever!]]''\n\n==Trivia==\n*Gretchen is the first of the Fireside Girls (besides Isabella) to have a speaking role in the series. Early on in the episode \"The Fast and the Phineas\", she is the girl who asks the question about Phineas\u2019s racecar being electronically fuel injected; however, she is not given a name at this point. Her name comes later when Isabella compliments her on the bow she ties on the car, but it is unknown which Fireside Girl she is since Isabella was speaking to the group. The last piece to the puzzle is that Ariel Winter is credited as Gretchen in the end credits for the episode. The episode\u2019s print novelization in ''[[Speed Demons]]'' further confirms this by way of the narration explicitly stating that it is Gretchen who asks the question.\n*She and [[Katie]] are the only Fireside Girls who appeared in the [[Phineas and Ferb (video game)|''Phineas and Ferb'' Nintendo DS game]].\n*In \u201c[[Isabella and the Temple of Sap]],\u201d she appeared to take the most prominent role, having the most spoken lines of dialogue.\n*She may be a reference of Velma from ''Scooby-Doo'', whom she resembles in several ways, and may be the girl using the catchphrase \u201cJinkies\u201d off-screen in that episode.\n**She may also be a reference to Marcie from the ''Peanuts'' comic strips and TV specials. Gretchen often calls Isabella \u2018Chief\u2019 much like the way Marcie calls Peppermint Patty \u201cSir.\u201d\n*She shares a few traits with an earlier character from Disney with the same name, [[Gretchen Grundler]] from ''[[Recess]]''. Both girls have red hair and glasses, and both are very kind and smart.\n*She is the only Fireside girl, along with Katie and Milly, to appear in \u201c[[Disney's Phineas and Ferb: The Best LIVE Tour Ever!|Disney\u2019s Phineas and Ferb: The Best LIVE Tour Ever!]]\u201d\n*She was the only Fireside Girl who didn\u2019t appear in \u201c[[Phineas and Ferb Christmas Vacation!]]\u201d, but appeared for a cameo in \u201c[[A Phineas and Ferb Family Christmas]].\u201d\n*She is the only Fireside Girl (besides Isabella) to have a part of the \u201cToo Young\u201d line (\u201c[[Isabella and the Temple of Sap]]\u201d) and the only female (besides Candace) to have the \u201cOut, peace!\u201d line (\u201c[[Monster from the Id]]\u201d).\n*In \u201c[[The Ballad of Badbeard (song)|The Ballad of Badbeard]]\u201d, she appears to get seasick.\n*Gretchen appears to be the shortest and the lightest of the main Fireside Girls as [[Adyson Sweetwater]] were able to carry her weight while she was reading \u201cThe Fireside Girls Book of Dendrology\u201d (a large, heavy book) with no problems in \u201c[[Isabella and the Temple of Sap]].\u201d\n*In the future-set episode \"[[Act Your Age]]\", Gretchen is shown to have grown considerably over 10 years, becoming at least as tall as most of her fellow former Fireside Girls if not the tallest.\n*In \u201c[[Tri-Stone Area]],\u201d she is seen without her glasses as a cavegirl while singing \u201c[[Zubada]].\u201d\n*[[Dan Povenmire]] revealed that she is \u201ca dead-on caricature\u201d of character designer Greg Guler\u2019s daughter.\n*In \u201c[[Bee Story]]\u201d she seemed to have gotten annoyed with [[Katie]]\u2019s buzzing when asking her what was she doing.\n*\"[[Jump Right to It]]\" is the only song that Gretchen was the lead singer.
