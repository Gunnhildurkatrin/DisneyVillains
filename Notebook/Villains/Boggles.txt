"[[File:Boggle.png|thumb|250px]]\n:''For the characters of the same name from [[Adventures of the Gummi Bears]], see [[Boggles (Adventures of the Gummi Bears)|Boggles]]!''\n\n'''Boggles''' are creatures featured in the animated television show ''[[American Dragon: Jake Long]]''. They are only seen in the episode \"[[Fu Dog Takes a Walk]]\". \n\n==History==\nBoggles, on ''American Dragon: Jake Long'', are humanoid creatures covered in brown fur. Not much is known about them since only one is briefly seen. They are never mentioned or seen again.\n\n==Physical Appearance==\nAlthough covered in fur, Boggles have scruffier beards and manes that stand out in comparison to the rest of their body. This permits them to hide in a crowd of humans more efficiently, especially if they wear clothes covering the rest of their skin. Their nose is shaped like a dog's, and they have pointed ears.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In Scottish mythology, the Boggle is a ghost or folkloric being that is the equivalent of the boogie man or bogart in England.\n*According to Northern English mythology, the Boggle could be a derivation of the Barghest, a dog-like creature with the power of shapeshifting.\n*Apparently, Boggles shed so much that they're even worse than real dogs.\n*In \"Fu Dog Takes a Walk\", the unnamed Boggle adopts a pet Beagle.\n\n{{American Dragon: Jake Long}}\n[[Category:American Dragon: Jake Long characters]]\n\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
