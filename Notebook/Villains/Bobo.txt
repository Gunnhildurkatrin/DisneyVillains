He is a non-spirit guide [[chanul]] who hopes to become a spirit guide but tends to give terrible advice to humans.\n\n==Role in the series==\nBobo was kicked out of Spirit Guide school for poor judgment. He went to the M\u00e0zico stalks to steal one but was caught by [[Cacahuate]]. Bobo used the M\u00e0zico to tie up Cacahuate and then took his stripes so he could not follow him. He went to [[Avalor]] to help humans where he met [[Elena Flores|Elena]] and [[Mateo]]. Mateo wanted to meet his spirit guide so Bobo thought he could send him to the [[Spirit World]] to meet him. He used his M\u00e0zico to send Mateo away and left to help more humans. At the castle, he went around giving people bad advice and ended up making trouble. To stop his hazardous activities, Zuzo and a few other spirit guides enter the castle to apprehend Bobo, leading to a chase around the castle.\n\nEventually, Zuzo and the spirits corner Bobo; at that moment, Elena, Mateo, and Cacahuate return from the Spirit World giving Bobo the opportunity to escape. However, Elena uses the [[Scepter of Light]] to catch Bobo with [[Chancellor Esteban]] in the library. She uses the scepter to blast Bobo with a blazing spell away from Esteban, causing him to release the M\u00e0zico back as the other Spirit Animals surround Bobo. Bobo realizes the trouble he's caused for the humans and admits that he is not cut out to be a spirit guide. However, Elena offers Bobo to become King of the Zanies, which Bobo eagerly accepts. Back in the Spirit World, Zuzo gets Bobo acquainted with the Zanies who accept Bobo as their king. Together, Bobo leads the Zanies through the Shadow Tunnels to meet the Shadow Spirits.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nSpirit Monkey Business 3.png\nEp20SpiritMonkeyBusiness35.png\nKing_Bobo.png\nFinding Zuzo 3.png\nZuzo and Elena saved by Bobo and Cacahuate.png\nFZ Bobo & Cacahuate hug.png\nBobo, Troyo and Flo.jpg\nElena's team.jpg\nBobo calls a foul.jpg\nBobo tops Troyo.jpg\nElena grabs Bobo's tail.jpg\nBobo angry at Elena.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*He was voiced by [[Max Mittelman]], who also voiced Plagg in the \"Miraculous Ladybug\" series.\n*He sounds a lot like Plagg from \"Miraculous Ladybug.\"\n\n{{Elena of Avalor}}\n[[Category:Elena of Avalor characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Spirits]]\n[[Category:Monkeys]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Characters who fly]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Kings]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
