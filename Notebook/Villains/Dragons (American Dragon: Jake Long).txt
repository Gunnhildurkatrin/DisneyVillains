Some dragons are chosen to protect a determinate country, becoming that country's national dragon (the [[China|Chinese]] dragon, [[Japan]]ese\u00a0dragon, Korean dragon, [[United States|American]] dragon, [[Canada|Canadian]] dragon, etc., have been seen).\n\nThese beings possess two kinds of ''Chi'' or Life Energy. A human chi and a dragon chi which is the source of their powers. They are born as humans with their dragon chi remaining dormant till the age of 13, which is when their powers begin to emerge. Even in human form their dragon side can affect them such as extremely bad breath as a result of their fire-breathing glands maturing as shown in \"Dragon Breath\" another instance was in ''\"BreakOut\"'' when Jake had entered his first ten-year dragon molting cycle, causing him to adopt a temporarily grotesque appearance which ended in him molting out of his old skin. Occasionally some of them are locked in human-form as access to dragon powers skipped them. Arguably, this also means it is possible for some of the power-skipped to be locked in dragon-form, unable to shift to human. While this was never addressed, it should be noted that [[The Dark Dragon]] was never seen in a human guise.\n\nIt was revealed that if the dragon chi is removed from a dragon, they would become ordinary humans unable to shift into dragon forms until their dragon chi is returned. So far only members of the World Dragon Council possess the ability to remove a dragon's chi. It's also shown that a dragon's human form is their default form as they revert back to human if severely weaken.\n\n==Background==\nIn the time of [[Ancient Greece]], all magical beings, including dragons, were enslaved by three wicked magical sisters, [[Fury Gorgon|Fury]], [[Euryale]], and [[Medusa Gorgon|Medusa]], known as the Gorgons, who, when united, had the power to encase in stone, anyone who looked at them. The Gorgons used this power to rule all of Greece\u00a0with an iron fist and force human and magical creature alike to worship them as goddesses.\n\nEventually, a human warrior (possibly the [[Greece|Greek]]\u00a0hero {{WikipediaLink|Perseus}})rose and fought the wicked sisters. The exact battle is unknown, but in the end, the warrior used his shield to reflect their paralyzing powers which, in turn, encased them in marble. After the fall of the Gorgons, peace returned to all the magical creatures. It is possible that during this time, the World [[The Dragon Council|Dragon Council]] was established, where they first began the designation of a dragon to protect magical creatures located in each determined country (China possibly being the first).\n\nThe time of the Middle Ages would bring an uncontrollable fear of magic in Europe. During this time, a regrettable incident involving humans would cause the unfortunate perception of dragons as damsel-snatchers and beasts. It is possible that during this time is when [[the Huntsclan]] had its roots.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nDragons are born in their human form (which raises the question as to whether they're humans with mystical powers or intelligent animals who can take human form) and gain their powers over time, usually around puberty.\n\nIn their human form, they resemble ordinary humans, but when in dragon form, their look is that of a lizard or snake with horns. Some dragons possess wings and others do not. Wings types can vary, from butterfly-like to bat-like.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nDragons are beings of a great magical power. Amongst their powers are:\n*'''Shapeshifting''': Dragons can shapeshift between their human and dragon form. A dragon can also call on an individual power while in human form (Eye of the Dragon, Tail of the Dragon, etc.). If they drink a magic potion, dragons can unlock their shapeshifting potential and gain the power of shapeshifting to the form of whomever they want, but only for twenty-four hours. The potion also renders them unable to use any other dragon powers for that time.\n*'''Flight''': Some dragons, like [[Luong Lao Shi|Lao Shi]], don't have wings. So dragons receive a little help from magic, and not only can they fly, but also dodge and attack targets.\n*'''Infrared Vision''': With their dragon vision, dragons are capable of seeing in darkness, as well as through some objects.\n*'''Enhanced Strength''': Dragons, despite the skinny appearance of some of them, are capable of immense strength though they are outclassed by more powerfully built beings, like Giants.\n*'''Duplication (The Doppelganger Technique)''': By channeling their chi energy, dragons are capable of creating a magical copy of themselves.\n*'''Potions''': Many dragons are knowledgeable in magic potions. This can allow them to travel between dimensions, enter other people's dreams, gain temporary magic powers, or enhance their personal magic powers.\n*'''Fire breath''': Dragons are known to breathe fire, even in their human forms.\n\n===Weaknesses===\nDespite their vast powers, dragons are far from invincible and possess some weaknesses:\n*'''Sphinx Hair''': Dragons' most shown weakness is fur of a Sphinx, which can severely weaken a dragon and kill them if exposed long enough to it.\n*'''[[Magic]]''': Dragons can be vulnerable to select spells, potions, and even the magical powers of other magical creatures like Gorgons which are very powerful to affect dragons. Gorgons can turn all living beings, dragons included, into stone. Even weakened Gorgons can blast waves of energy that can be lethal. Also in the same way potions can give dragons greater magical prowess, certain potions can be used to put them under mind control, temporarily strip them of their powers, or immobilize them. \n*'''Strike behind the left ear''': As learned in [[the Academy|the Huntsclan Academy]], a surefire way to kill a dragon is by striking it behind the left ear. During [[Rose]] and [[Jake]]'s climactic battle in the Academy, Rose struck Jake in this location, seemingly killing him, thus allowing her to go back in the field in [[New York City|New York]]. However, during the battle, the duo utilized a faulty potion Jake and [[Arthur Spudinski|Spud]] made while undercover at the academy, giving Jake the temporary appearance of death, and thus sparing his life.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Dragons]]\n\n== External Links ==\n\n*[https://adjl.fandom.com/wiki/Dragons Dragons on American Dragon: Jake Long]\n\n{{American Dragon: Jake Long}}\n[[Category:American Dragon: Jake Long characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Dragons]]\n[[Category:Mystical animals]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Legendary creatures]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
