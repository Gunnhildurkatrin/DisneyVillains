She is not seen again for the rest of each of these films, and just like Mammy Two-Shoes from most of her appearances in early ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons, her head is not shown. She often threatens to kill Roger if he messes with Baby Herman\n \n==Trivia==\n*On set in the film, she is revealed to be just a pair of oversized mechanical legs with a skirt draped around them.\n*Her screen time in all of her appearances are limited to just small cameos at the beginning (especially the three [[Tummy Trouble|Roger Rabbit]] [[Trail Mix-Up|theatrical]] [[Roller Coaster Rabbit|shorts]]).\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Who Framed Roger Rabbit}}\n[[Category:Unseen characters]]\n[[Category:Who Framed Roger Rabbit characters]]\n[[Category:Character stubs]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
