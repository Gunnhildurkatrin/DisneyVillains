His purpose in the film is as someone for [[the Evil Queen]] to speak to (mostly as the Witch) in order for plot points to be conveyed to the audience. He appears to be intimidated by the Queen, in both of her forms.\n\n==Background==\n===Development===\nThe raven is one of several characters used to interact with the Queen to add conviction to her character. [[Joe Grant]] knew the work of Wilhelm Busch, and it is likely that he was inspired by an 1894 Busch illustration of a raven perched on a skull.<ref name=\"Allan\">Robin Allan, \"Walt Disney and Europe\" (Indiana University Press, Indiana, 1999) ISBN 0-253-21353-3</ref>\n\nA deleted short sequence involving the Witch stirring her cauldron was fully animated and completed, and was among the scenes cut from the film by [[Walt Disney]] at the last minute. In the sequence, the raven looks on as the Witch stirs the cauldron with a huge bone. She pauses to see that the smoke rising from the brew is shaped like skulls, and adds a drop of an unknown ingredient to the concoction:\n\n:''\"Boil, cauldron, boil. Boil, cauldron, boil. Death within thy depths I see, for one who dares to rival me. Brew the magic recipe, boil, cauldron, BOIL!.\"''\n\nAt this, smoke from the cauldron fills the room. This sequence would have occurred immediately after the scene of the Seven Dwarfs going to sleep in their cottage; the sequence would have been followed by the scene in which the Witch dips the apple into the brew to make it poisonous.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''===\nThe raven seems to live in [[the Evil Queen]]'s laboratory in the dungeon as her pet. When first seen, he is sleeping, perched on a skull; he wakes when she enters and is startled by the effects of the ingredients of her potion. He is frightened by the Queen in her Witch form, and hides in the skull, peering out of its sockets. He watches the Witch preparing the [[Poisoned Apple]], and as such is terrified when she, as a cruel joke, offers him the apple. The Raven is finally seen after the Witch leaves the castle, leaving his fate uncertain.\n\n===Comics===\nRe-imagined as a talking raven (quite similar to [[Ratface]]), the Raven was featured in several Disney comics. His most notable role was in the 1978 story ''[https://inducks.org/story.php?c=W+WDC+459-02 The House Guest]'', where he is chased away from her house by the Evil Queen for having meddled with the [[Magic Mirror]]. Lamenting he'll have nowhere to spend the night, the Raven is taken in by [[Chip and Dale]], but proves to be an extremely problematic guest.\n\n===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===\nHe has made three cameo appearances in the show. In the series, he takes the role of [[The Evil Queen|Regina]]'s messenger. Like in the original movie, he seems capable of understanding human's language. \n[[File:Raven in OUAT.png|thumb|257x257px|Raven in season 6, \"''[[Heartless (Once Upon a Time)|Heartless]]\"'']]\nInterestingly, the first time he has appeared was in \"[[Into the Deep|''into the deep'']]\", but this time he wasn't [[The Evil Queen (Once Upon a Time)|Regina]]'s messenger, but [[Queen of Hearts|Cora]]'s (who is Regina's mother in this series). After capturing [[Aurora]], Cora tries to exchange her for a magic compass that could lead [[Snow White|Mary Margaret/Snow White]] and [[Emma Swan|Emma]] back to [[Storybrooke]]. She knows that Snow and Emma would never let her die. [[Queen of Hearts|Cora]] order her Raven to deliver the message to [[Snow White]].\n\nHe appears once again in season four in \"''[[White Out]]\".'' After [[Maid Marian]] comes back from the past and [[Robin Hood (character)|Robin Hood]] makes up with her for [[Roland (Once Upon a Time)|Roland]]'s happiness, [[The Evil Queen|Regina]] is devastated. So much so that she uses the Raven to deliver a message to [[Henry Mills|Henry]], in which she explain that she doesn't want anyone to visit her. \n\nHe appears again in Season 6, when [[The Evil Queen|Regina]] delivers a false message to distract [[Theodora the Wicked Witch of the West|Zelena]] to surprise the Evil Queen and [[Rumplestiltskin|Gold]] in intimate relation, while [[Emma Swan|Emma]], [[Snow White|her]] [[The Prince|parents]], [[Captain Hook|Hook]] and [[Blue Fairy|Blue]] search a way to trap [[Evil Regina|the Evil Queen]]. \n\n==[[Disney Parks]]==\nThe Raven makes an appearance in all 4 versions [[Snow White's Scary Adventures]]. He can be seen peering through the cottage window with the Queen along with reacting to the Queen's transformation and at the cauldron.\n\nThe raven also appeared in [[World of Color|World of Color: Villainous]] at [[Disney California Adventure]].\n\n==Gallery==\n===Screenshots===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\n\nSnow-white-disneyscreencaps.com-5642.jpg\nSnow-white-disneyscreencaps.com-5653.jpg\nSnowwhite-disneyscreencaps.com-8650-1-.jpg|The Raven struggling against the blast of wind\nSnow-white-disneyscreencaps.com-5896.jpg|Scared by the Queen's hideous disguise\nSnow-white-disneyscreencaps.com-5902.jpg\nSnow-white-disneyscreencaps.com-5926.jpg\nSnow-white-disneyscreencaps.com-5933.jpg\nSnow-white-disneyscreencaps.com-7299.jpg\nSnow-white-disneyscreencaps.com-7324.jpg\nSnow-white-disneyscreencaps.com-7329.jpg\nSnow-white-disneyscreencaps.com-7456.jpg\nSnow-white-disneyscreencaps.com-7469.jpg|The Raven watches the Witch leave.\n\n</gallery>\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nWitch cauldron.JPG|The Witch and the raven in the deleted scene\nGrantraven.jpg|[[Joe Grant]]'s design for the raven\nDisney Princess Snow White's Story Illustraition 11.jpg\nRaven 447.jpg\nDVG Mummy Dust.png|In ''[[Disney Villainous]]''.\nHidden Crow - DisneyMagicKingdoms.png|In ''[[Disney Magic Kingdoms]]''.\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}{{DISPLAYTITLE:Raven}}\n\n{{Snow White}}\n[[es:El Cuervo (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs)]]\n[[fr:Corbeau (Blanche-Neige)]]\n[[it:Corvo (Biancaneve)]]\n[[pt-br:Corvo (Branca de Neve e os Sete An\u00f5es)]]\n[[sr-el:Gavran (Sne\u017eana i sedam patuljaka)]]\n[[vi:Qu\u1ea1 (B\u1ea1ch Tuy\u1ebft v\u00e0 B\u1ea3y Ch\u00fa L\u00f9n)]]\n[[Category:Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:Once Upon a Time characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Wonderful World of Color]]\n[[Category:Ravens]]"
