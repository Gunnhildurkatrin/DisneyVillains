He's a former Formula-One racedriver who got kicked out after being suspected of sabotage and is the owner of [[Herbie|Herbie's]] evil twin [[Horace (The Love Bug)|Horace]].\n\n==Background==\nIt is unknown how Simon gained possession of [[Herbie]] (it was mentioned that he requested Herbie when he heard what a great race car he was) but after failing to win races for him he decides to send him to the junk yard.\n\nHe shows a complete dislike for the little car but after seeing him do incredible things he didn't do when he had him he becomes determined to learn the car's secret. He soon finds Herbie's creator Dr. Gustav Stumpfel and persuades him to build another car like him but with an evil competitive personality, which he calls [[Horace (The Love Bug)|Horace]].\n\nAfter cutting Stumpfel loose, Simon decides to eliminate the competition by destroying Herbie and sends Horace and his right-hand man Rupert to carry it out. However, when he discovers Herbie has been rebuilt he decides to settle this in the road race between the two little cars. ''\"The winner takes home both cars, to do what he wants.\"''\n\nUsing modifications, he gains most of first place but his evil little car fails to win the race. Horace becomes so angry with losing that he tries to destroy Herbie again only to miss and go off the edge of a dam.\n\nSimon becomes upset over the loss of his car and is later arrested by the police along with Rupert for using unlicensed weaponry.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\" position=\"center\">\nSimon-Moore-III-3.png\n1997-coccinelleTV-4.jpg\nSimon-Moore-III-2.png|ready to race\nI-Hate-that-car.png|\"I hate that car.\"\nSimon-Moore-III-1.png|\"Yes!\"\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Love Bug}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Moore III, Simon}}\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Scottish characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action villains]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:The Love Bug characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]"
