They were born in early spring, when every young fawn is born.\n\n==Background==\nDespite their names never being spoken in the film, they are taken from the book ''{{WikipediaLink|Bambi's Children}}'' by Felix Salten, the sequel to the original story ''Bambi: A Life in the Woods''. They are also used when they are featured in the comic book \"Four Panel #30\" under the story name \"Bambi's Children\", the same name as the book.\n\n===Geno===\nGeno is Bambi and Faline's older son. He was born a couple of minutes before Gurri. He has orange eyes like Bambi did as a fawn. He has 12 spots, 6 on each side. He looks similar to Bambi when he was a fawn. He will grow up to be the next Great Prince of the Forest.\n\n===Gurri===\nGurri is Bambi and Faline's younger daughter. She has blue eyes, like her mother, and has a lot of similarities to Faline as a fawn. She has 12 spots, 6 on each side. When she grows up, she will be a princess.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nbambi-disneyscreencaps.com-7895.jpg|A pair of newborn fawns.\nbambi-disneyscreencaps.com-7902.jpg|Gurri awakens first...\nbambi-disneyscreencaps.com-7914.jpg|Geno awakes next\nbambi-disneyscreencaps.com-7926.jpg|Geno bites Gurri's ear.\nbambi-disneyscreencaps.com-7929.jpg|Gurri and Geno\nbambi-disneyscreencaps.com-7944.jpg|'''Friend Owl:''' \"I don't believe I've never seen a more likely looking pair of fawns\".\nbambi-disneyscreencaps.com-7950.jpg|'''Friend Owl:''' \"Prince Bambi oughta be mighty proud\".\nUs os 0030 04 001.jpeg\nus os 0030 00 001.jpeg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Bambi}}\n[[Category:Bambi characters]]\n[[Category:Deer]]\n[[Category:Character pairs]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Character groups]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Infants]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Twins and Triplets]]\n[[Category:Princes]]\n[[Category:Princesses]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]"
