He is [[Franny Robinson|Franny]]'s older brother and loves cannons.\n\n==Appearances==\n===[[Meet the Robinsons|''Meet the Robinsons'']]===\nGaston first appears when Lewis and Bud arrive in a large room where Gaston and Billie are having a race between Gaston's cannon and Billie's full-scale model train and asks Lewis to time the race. At dinner, as a distraction to keep Franny away from the truth about Lewis, Wilbur throws a meatball at Gaston and points the blame to Franny to start a food fight between the two. Gaston fires his meatball cannon and a bad kung-fu film dubbing-styled fight begins. Franny wins when she deflects Gaston's Italian sausage. Gaston participates in the battle against Tiny with both his meatball gun and his full cannon to launch Lefty onto the tyrannosaur's face.\n\n===[[Meet the Robinsons (video game)]]===\nGaston runs a meatball cannon firing range that allows Wilbur to test his dodging abilities, offering various challenges to test Wilbur throughout the game.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nmeettherobinsonspic17.jpg\noct113.gif|Clip art of Gaston\nWjuncle1.jpg|Gaston concept by William Joyce\nNormal 05robinsons236.jpg|Gaston and his cannon\nUncle Gaston.jpg\nUncle Gaston2.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Meet the Robinsons}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Framagucci, Gaston}}\n[[Category:Meet the Robinsons characters|Framagucci, Gaston]]\n[[Category:Characters|Framagucci, Gaston]]\n[[Category:Males|Framagucci, Gaston]]\n[[Category:Disney characters|Framagucci, Gaston]]\n[[Category:Uncles|Framagucci, Gaston]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]"
