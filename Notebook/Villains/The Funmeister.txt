He served as Pleasure Island's logo.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Background ===\nThe Funmeister is a sort of supernatural being comparable to a spirit or deity.  He is a moon faced spirit whose name comes from rough Germanic languages.  The Funmeister embodied festivity, the celebration of life and the sharing of laughter.\n\nThe Funmeister's origins go back to having been worshiped by barbarian tribes following the collapse of Rome.  The Funmeister was worshiped in [[Florida]] by the indigenous Seminole tribe who lived on the island that would become Pleasure Island in [[Lake Buena Vista]].\n\nWhile in Mexico around the year [[1900]], wealthy adventurer [[Merriweather Adam Pleasure]] began having visions of the Funmeister.  The visions guided Merriweather to Pleasure Island in [[1911]] where he found a totem of the Funmeister as left by the Seminole tribe.  Due to being seen as a representative of the Funmeister, the tribe allowed for Merriweather to purchase and settle on the island with him coming to hold the moniker of, \"Grand Funmeister\" and throwing parties nightly as tribute to the spirit.\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n=== Pleasure Island ===\nThe Funmeister served as the icon for Pleasure Island with his likeness being found all throughout the area and within its promotional materials.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* It is possible that the more paranormal occurrences of Pleasure Island held some connection to the magic of the Funmeister.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nDisney pleasure island.jpg\nPi.gif\nFunmeister_Totem.jpg|The Seminole totem of the Funmeister\n(PLEASURE ISLAND.jpg\nVinylFunmeister.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Spirits]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Immortal]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Pleasure Island]]"
