She rehired her after she realized Jessie was right about everything.\n\nIn \"Zombie Tea Party 5\", it was mentioned Bertram broke her and her husband's wedding china.\n\nIn \"Christmas Story\", she and her husband get caught in a snow-storm, but they do make it home in time for Christmas.\n\nIN \"World Wide Web of Lies\", she gets an early flight home to spend time with her family.
