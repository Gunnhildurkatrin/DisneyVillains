He thinks [[Z\u00e9 Galo]] would be the ideal boyfriend for her. He always seems ambitious and insightful, keeping a very luxurious and careful life. Because he is a member of the high society, he does not want to develop a friendship with [[Jos\u00e9 Carioca]] and his friends.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n[[Category:Toucans]]\n[[Category:Brazilian characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]"
