His later roles would often pair him up with [[Pluto]].\n\n==Personality==\nHe is a seal who tends to show up in typical seal locations (the circus, the beach, the zoo, the arctic) and annoy Pluto into chasing him, causing Pluto to get into dangerous predicaments. Salty typically saves him, leading Salty and Pluto to become best friends\u2014until Salty's ''next'' appearance, when the cycle begins again.\n\nOtherwise, Salty is just a mischievous little seal pup but means no harm to anyone, as he is mostly driven by his childlike curiosity. And even when he gets in trouble, he's slippery and clever enough to avoid it.\n\n==History==\nSalty's debut appearance came in ''[[Mickey's Circus]]'' (1936), in which he tormented Donald Duck. ''[[Pluto's Playmate]]'' (1941), ''[[Rescue Dog]]'' (1947), and the particularly famous ''[[Mickey and the Seal]]'' (1948) followed.\n\n==Television==\n===''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]''===\nSalty shows up in one episode. ''[[Pluto's Seal Deal]]'' (1999) marked the first of Salty's more recent roles.\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\n[[File:Salty the Seal House of Mouse.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Salty the Seal in ''House of Mouse''.]]\nIn an episode of ''House of Mouse'' \"[[Snow Day]]\", there's a big blizzard, which means that the House of Mouse is closed for the day... until Salty the Seal shows up, looking for some entertainment so Mickey and the gang put on a show for him.\n\n===''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]''===\nSalty's most recent appearances are in ''Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.'' Salty made his series debut in the episode \"[[Pluto's Playmate (Mickey Mouse Clubhouse episode)|Pluto's Playmate]]\" where Mickey and friends helped Salty learn tricks for his upcoming circus show. He was later seen in the jungle in\u00a0\"[[Mickey's Fishy Story]]\".\n\n==Disney Parks==\nHe appears on the Disneyland's Toontown \"Toontown's Official Seal\" in the City Hall and on Minnie's Offical Citizen Certificate in [[Mickey's Toontown Fair]]. Since Mickey's Toontown Fair was demolished to make room for an expanded Fantasyland in the 2010s decade, he's currently featured in the posters at Storybook Circus.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Despite being a sea lion, he's always referred to as a 'seal', though he is not\u00a0a true seal.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nSalty the Seal.JPG\nSalty the Seal 3.jpg\n789211.jpg|Salty the Seal in ''Mickey Mouse Clubhouse''\n140958.jpg|Salty the Seal in ''Mickey Mouse Works''\nSeal.jpg|Salty as a literal seal for [[Toontown]]\nSalty.jpg\nsalty again.jpg|Salty with Mickey and Pluto\nSalty snow day.jpg\n148432.jpg\n148468.jpg\nWorkinforpeanutssalty.jpg|Salty's cameo in ''[[Working for Peanuts]]''.\n1941-camarade-2.jpg\nVlcsnap-2013-08-10-11h42m25s7.png\nMickey and salty.jpg\nRescue dog 14large.jpg\nRescue dog 13large.jpg\nRescue dog 11large.jpg\nRescue dog 10large.jpg\nRescue dog 9large.jpg\nRescue dog 8large.jpg\nRescue dog 7large.jpg\nRESCUE DOG.png\nTumblr nc4smuC6KV1qhcrb0o1 1280.jpg\nMickey seal and pluto.jpg\n740full-mickey-and-the-seal-screenshot.jpg\nSalty and Humphrey.jpg|Salty on a poster at Storybook Circus in the [[Magic Kingdom]]\nSalty and Humphrey2.jpg|Salty poster on the left in Storybook Circus\nSalty poster.jpg|Salty poster in Storybook Circus\n1947-rescue-8.jpg\n1947-rescue-6.jpg\n1947-rescue-7.jpg\n1947-rescue-5.jpg\n1947-rescue-4.jpg\n1947-rescue-3.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Mickey Mouse & Friends}}\n{{Mickey Mouse Works}}\n[[es:La Foca Salty]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Marine Animals]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse Clubhouse characters]]\n[[Category:Infants]]\n[[Category:Seals]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Zoo Animals]]\n[[Category:Circus performers]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]"
