He is considered as a God. However, in actual Greek mythology, Narcissus was a man who was very handsome. Due to not loving a nymph (nature spirit) called Echo, Narcissus was made to look at a reflection of himself, and fall in love with himself. He could not look away, so eventually he died.\n\nThe [[Olympian Gods]] took pity on him and turned Narcissus into a flower known as the Narcissus and god of the vanity and son of Cephissus the river god and Liriope naiad nymph. In the [[1997]] film, he is portrayed as an Olympian god with white hair and purple skin.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nHERCULES Narcissus RichB.png\n71cf86bf5b624aba5e24fb0880602239.jpg\nNarcissus by 666 lucemon 666-d4mg703.jpg\nNarcissusherculestvseries.png|Narcissus in ''[[Hercules (TV series)|Hercules]]''\n</gallery>\n\n{{Hercules}}\n[[Category:Gods]]\n[[Category:Hercules characters]]\n[[Category:Greek Mythology]]\n[[Category:Olympian Gods]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Greek characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]"
