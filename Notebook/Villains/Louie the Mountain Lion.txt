His last theatrical appearance was in the [[Donald Duck]] short ''[[Grand Canyonscope]]''.\n\n\n\n\n\n==Personality==\nLouie is buffoonish and sometimes grumpy. His cartoons often see him chasing after either Donald Duck or Goofy.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]''===\nLouie, along with [[Humphrey the Bear]], appears in the episode \"[[Bearing Up Baby]]\", where he attempts to attack Humphrey and the Rescue Rangers.\n\n===''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]''===\nHe first appears in \"[[Goofy's Big Kitty]]\", where escapes from a circus and hides in Goofy's home and is mistaken for [[Mr. Pettibone|Goofy's new kitten]].\n\nHe later appears in ''[[Goofy's Radio]]'', where he tries to eat Goofy but uncontrollably dances to the music of Goofy's radio.\n\n===''[[House of Mouse]]''===\nLouie makes a small appearance in \"[[Goofy's Valentine Date]]\". He also appears in \"[[Pluto Saves the Day]]\" just before \"Goofy's Big Kitty\" is shown, where Goofy tells him that this cartoon stars Goofy and him, then roars at him making Goofy say ''him and'' Goofy.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*His design is identical to the tiger in the Goofy short ''[[Tiger Trouble]]''. Drawings of Louie in a model sheet are animation drawings of the tiger from ''Tiger Trouble'' but without the stripes. Co-incidentally, [[Raja|Raja the Tiger]], the secondary antagonist of the animated short ''[[Goliath II]]'', bears a close physical resemblance to both Louie and the tiger from ''Tiger Trouble''.\n*His son appears once in ''[[Hook, Lion and Sinker]]''. Louie attempts to catch [[Donald Duck]]'s fishing trip prizes with help of a young lion cub who had to pick bullets out of his backside.\n*''[[Grand Canyonscope]]'' is the only short that Louie appears in that doesn't have a \"lion\" pun in the title.\n\n{{Mickey Mouse & Friends}}\n{{Rescue Rangers}}\n\n[[es:Louie, el Puma]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:House of Mouse characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse Works characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse universe characters]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Zoo Animals]]\n[[Category:Cougars]]\n[[Category:Lions]]"
