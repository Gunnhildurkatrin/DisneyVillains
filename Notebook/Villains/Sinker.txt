'''Experiment 602''', is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]].\u00a0He is designed sink entire naval fleets with his long, razor-sharp dorsal fin; he is able to hold his breath underwater indefinitely to carry out his primary function. His one true place is at a [[Japan]]ese restaurant, cutting up fish fillets and vegetables to make sushi.\n\n==Background==\n===Personality===\nSinker is shown to be greatly offended by the mocking of his size compared to the rest of him. He is also incredibly territorial and will claim an entire body of water and remain there until he has sunk every vessel in the area.\n\n===Physical appearance===\nSinker is a small purple shark-like experiment with small dark red eyes, a thin mouth with a turquoise tongue, small arms and legs, and a large, sword-like dorsal fin.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nSinker can use his large, razor dorsal fin to slice sea vessels\u00a0up to the size of a yacht in two. He can also use his dorsal fin like a knife to cut up and chop food. He can swim underwater like a shark and is capable of holding his breath indefinitely, indicating that he has lungs instead of gills.\n\n=== Weakness ===\nDue to having a big dorsal fin he is rendered immobile when someone steps on it.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===\nExperiment 602 was the 602nd genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Jacques von H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to slice enemy sea vessels in two with his large, sword-like dorsal fin.\u00a0602 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].\n\nAll of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.\n\nAt an unknown point after this, Experiment 602 was activated.\n\nWhen [[Keoni Jameson|Keoni]] was practicing for an upcoming boat race, 602 sunk his boat while [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Stitch]] were both watching. Later, when Lilo and Stitch attempted to capture 602, the latter proceeded to sink their motorboat as well. When [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] and [[Pleakley]] tried to go\u00a0and rescue them, 602 sunk their raft also.\n\n602, named Sinker, then proceeded to sink [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] and [[Reuben|Experiment 625]] numerous times when they attempted to catch the former, and likely sunk other watercraft.\n\nLater, Lilo, Stitch, Jumba, and Pleakley stowed away aboard a cruise ship, where Lilo tried in vain to warn the captain about Sinker's rampage. However, they got caught and thrown in the brig due to Stitch's horseplay. After the four managed to break out, Jumba hatched a plan to capture Sinker.\n\nWhile Stitch, wearing scuba gear (and defying his aquaphobia), dove underwater to look for Sinker, the latter retreated to a cave until he eventually came out, revealing the diminutive size of his body. However, Sinker was unamused when Stitch laughed at the former's puny size.\n\nSinker then escaped, but Stitch chased after him and was able to grab hold of his large dorsal fin. Sinker sunk a fishing boat, where two fishermen were catching fish with a net. He then attempted to sink the runaway cruise ship, but Stitch managed to capture Sinker in the ship's anchor and chain.\n\nShortly after, Sinker was found a one true place at a sushi restaurant, cutting up fish fillets and vegetables with his elongated dorsal fin.\n\nIn \"[[Drowsy (episode)|Drowsy]]\", Sinker's picture was seen in [[Lilo's Experiment Book|Lilo's experiment logbook]].\n\nIn \"[[Ploot (episode)|Ploot]]\", Lilo tried to convince Sinker to help her defeat [[Ploot]]. Unfortunately, he was unable to because he was very busy cutting up food for a large party while Hatha, the other chef who worked there, was sick.\n\nIn \"[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]\", Sinker's picture was seen in Lilo's experiment logbook again.\n\n===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===\nIn the film's opening, Sinker can be seen popping his head out of the water and waving hello to [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]].\n\nLater, the first 624 experiments, including Sinker, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium\u00a0to be destroyed. However, Lilo, [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]], and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.\n\nSinker participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]].\n\nThe Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben and several other experiments performed the song \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.\n\n===''[[Stitch!]]''===\nSinker made a cameo appearance in the ''Stitch!'' anime as an image on a computer screen and as one of the experiments in [[Dr. H\u00e4msterviel|H\u00e4msterviel]]'s [[Prison Asteroid K-37|prison cell]]. He made another appearance along with [[Slushy]], in which H\u00e4msterviel used both of them to attack a cruise ship that he had lured [[Stitch]] onto. It is also revealed that Sinker is capable of speaking fluently and has a blind spot on his dorsal fin, and he will become immobile if forced into a horizontal position because of his large fin. He later appeared in the special ''Stitch and the Planet of Sand''.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Sinker is an obvious parody of the titular great white shark from ''{{WikipediaLink|Jaws (film)|Jaws}}''.\n*Sinker was activated off-screen.\n*Sinker is one of the rare experiments to not have black eyes like most experiments, having dark red eyes instead.\n*Sinker's dorsal fin is shown to have differences in size, though it is likely a continuity error.\n*Despite being an aquatic-based experiment, Sinker appears to be unable to breathe underwater.\n*Sinker is one of the few experiments to not appear in the group photo at the end of ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''.\n*Sinker's\u00a0[[Experiment Pods|pod]] color is blue in the ''[[Stitch!]]'' anime.\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch Experiments]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Sea Monsters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Marine Animals]]\n[[Category:Sharks]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Chefs]]"
