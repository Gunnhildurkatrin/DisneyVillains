Two children and a herd of goats.|Brieux, the morning ot the [[Hyperion Airship|Hyperion's]] maiden voyage}}\n\n'''Captain Brieux''' is a character in ''[[The Island at the Top of the World]]''. He is an eccentric inventor and pilot of\u00a0the [[Hyperion Airship|Hyperion]]. [[Sir Anthony Ross]] bought the\u00a0Hyperion and hired Brieux to fly it to find his son, [[Donald Ross]].\n\n== Personality ==\nCaptain Brieux is a French inventor, ship pilot, and explorer. He is brilliant and eccentric, with many harebrained ideas and schemes and he is rarely shy about it. He is overall friendly and jovial, but can be agitated and annoyed when someone goes against his plans or ideas. He is also very adventurous, and eager to prove his worth and make history. He's very proud of his French heritage, and makes that no secret, as well.\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n=== ''[[The Island at the Top of the World]]'' ===\nCaptain Brieux built the Hyperion for a group of Americans. They backed out when he spent all of their money, but [[Sir Anthony Ross]] bought it so that he could finish it. When he found out that it was for a trip to the arctic, he thought it was a fool's gamble, but was talked into it with the promise of making history. So he, Ross, [[Professor Ivarsson]], and one of his crew members set out to the arctic. Halfway there, one of the propellers broke, but Brieux fixed it, himself. He flew the Hyperion in between narrow glaciers just to show that he could do it.\n\nWhen they reach Fort Conger, Ross asked Brieux to swap his crew member for [[Oomiak]], so they can find out where [[Donald Ross]] went. As they grew closer to their destination, Ivarsson asked Brieux to lower the ship so that they could travel on foot. He objected to it, and flew straight into the clouds. The Hyperion crashed into the mountain, sending Ivarsson, Ross, and Oomiak falling out of it, while Brieux and Josephine were left alone.\n\nBrieux was reunited with the group, along with Donald and his friend [[Freyja]], in the Bay of Whales, where he saved them from an attack. He had the idea to detach the gondola and motors to fly the Hyperion out of Astragard until they reached Fort Conger, again. It succeeded until the ship was shot down by [[the Godi]]. Brieux left [[Astragard]] with Josephine Ross, Oomiak, Donald, and Freyja, when Ivarsson offered to stay behind in Donald's place, and they traveled on foot back to the rest of civilization.\n\n==[[Disney Parks]]==\n\n=== [[Disneyland]] ===\nThe Hyperion would have been the centerpiece of the never-built [[Discovery Bay]] at Disneyland, docked in Captain Brieux's hangar. Presumably, he was invited to Discovery Bay by [[Jason Chandler]] to further scientific discovery. The hangar would have been home to an attraction where guests flew the Hyperion over the arctic and around Astragard. After ''The Island at the Top of the World'' bombed at the box office, the attraction was never built.\n\n=== [[Disneyland Paris]] ===\n\n==== [[Cafe Hyperion]] ====\nBrieux's ship is docked at Cafe Hyperion in [[Discoveryland]] at [[Disneyland Paris]].  In the backstory for the restaurant, Brieux was a resident of Discoveryland who gave out aerial tours and transport.  This was before he mysteriously disappeared and left the Hyperion airship behind.\n\n=== [[Walt Disney World Resort|Walt Disney World]] ===\n\n==== [[Skipper Canteen]] ====\nA map created by Brieux and [[Jason Chandler]] sits on the wall of the [[Society of Explorers and Adventurers]] meeting room in Skipper Canteen at the Magic Kingdom. Presumably sometime after the events of the film, he rebuilt the Hyperion and used it for adventurers. The map charted legendary flying creatures on the Mekong River.\n\n== Trivia ==\n\n* It is unclear of Captain Brieux is intended to be a member of the Society of Explorers and Adventurers.  His name is listed under the S.E.A. crest as having created their map of the Mekong River although he has not had his name featured in the fez cabinet of the same restaurant nor the oar-wall of [[the Tropical Hideaway]], created after the Skipper Canteen.  Based off of this, it is possible that his name inclusion on the Mekong map is intended to imply that he was affiliated with S.E.A. but not a member of their official ranks.\n*The map created by Chandler and Brieux in the Skipper Canteen includes an illustration of [[Maleficent]]'s dragon form from [[Sleeping Beauty]].  The crest on this map contains the tribal mask from the Magic Kingdom's [[Jungle Cruise]] and the figureheads of the swans from the [[Plaza Swan Boats]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nitopworld2.jpg\n19399495_10155136794214550_5660367956562750214_n.jpg|Reference to Captain Brieux in Magic Kingdom's [[Skipper Canteen]], suggesting membership in the [[Society of Explorers and Adventurers]]\n</gallery>{{Society of Explorers and Adventurers}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brieux}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:French characters]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]\n[[Category:Inventors]]\n[[Category:The Island of the Top of the World characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Captains]]\n[[Category:S.E.A. characters]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]"
