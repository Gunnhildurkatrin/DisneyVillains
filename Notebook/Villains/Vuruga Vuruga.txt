After a mishap with the floodwaters, the young princess appears drenched in mud and water and greets Vuruga Vuruga with a bow. Vuruga Vuruga bows respectfully to Kiara and appears pleased by her presence. She praises Kiara's appearance, mentioning that royals tend to be very stuffy at these events and that Kiara must clearly understand what the event is all about, adding that she is very impressed.\n\nHearing the unexpected praise over her appearance, Kiara gives credit to her friends, Tiifu and Zuri, who always insist that she looks her best for important events such as these. Vuruga Vuruga smiles kindly towards them, making Tiifu and Zuri feel pleased that they could help their friend after all. Kiara then steps forward and announces the start of the Wallow, and Vuruga Vuruga stands at Kiara's side, watching as her herd participates in the important event.\n\n==== [[The Savannah Summit]] ====\nAfter Simba invites Makuu to the summit, Vuruga Vuruga and Twiga are nervous and wondering why he came.

Makuu steps up and gives a speech he becomes friends with everyone at the summit.\n\n==== [[The Traveling Baboon Show]] ====\nThe baboons perform for the Pridelanders but they discover that a food thief is in the Pridelands.\n\n==== [[The Ukumbusho Tradition]] ====\nWhen the bees ruin the show the elephants go all crazy. Fuli goes to warn Vuruga Vuruga's herd, but they don't think it's her because of her costume. Fuli decides to scare off the herd.\n\n==== [[The Golden Zebra]] ====\nWhen a drought hits the Pride Lands, Vuruga Vuruga argues with Twiga's herd over who should have the next drink, worried that they'll miss out entirely.

When they learn that Makuu has been invited, she voices her irritations to Twiga on their way over to\u00a0 Mizimu Grove, \u00a0believing that Makuu should not be present after all of the negative things he has done since becoming leader of\u00a0 his float. She and Twiga then discuss Makuu in private a little later on in a clearing to think of a plan to teach Makuu a lesson. Though later they would soon regret later when they thought completed his journey through the circle of life because of there trap.\n\n=== [[Makuu]] ===\nVuruga Vuruga didn't like Makuu at all let alone trust him at first afterall the things he and his crocodiles have done in the past. She was visibly shocked along with everyone else when she discovers that Makuu was invited to the Summit too. So along the way to to Mizimu Grove she and Twiga thought of a plan that would teach him a lesson by making fall into a pit of rotten fruit. Though later at sunset, when Kion convincingly tells the other leaders that Makuu fell into a pit and completed his journey through the circle of life, leaving her and everyone in great shock. She and Twiga confess to the act, claiming that they only wanted to make him smell bad. But to hers and everyone else's surprise, Makuu appears, angry at their lack of trust. Vuruga Vuruga and Twiga are worried that he is mad, but instead, Makuu applauds their trick, stating that it was a plan worthy of a crocodile.

Even though Fuli tries to confirm that it's her, Vuruga Vuruga still refuses, even after being warned of an incoming elephant herd.
