As she presents her creation to spectators, she unabashedly expresses her confidence that the fair's judge, Dr. Croix, will award her the winning prize by the end. Though her invention doesn't compare to the others, such as those created by [[Rapunzel]] or [[Varian]], she wins by a landslide, as Croix is apparently more interested in a flashy display, rather than breaking new ground in the scientific field.\n\n===Physical Appearance===\nFernanda is a tall, slender woman with brown skin, dark cyan eyes, and black curly hair. For gypsy wear, she has a deep pink head scarf, a pair of turquoise earrings, a dress made of deep pink blouse with light blue brims on the collar and ruffles at the end of her long sleeves, a deep pink and blue corset, and dark pink skirt with pink trimming, and black boots.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Judging by her comments, she appears to find Dr. Croix physically attractive, although this may have been an attempt to further boost her chances of winning.\n*Fernanda resembles a fortune teller character present in early concepts of ''[[Tangled]]''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nGreat Expotations 9.png\nGreat Expotations - Fernanda Pizazzo 03.jpg\nGreat Expotations 14.png\nTangled-the-series-20.png\nGreat Expotations - Fernanda Pizazzo 01.jpg\nGreat Expotations - Fernanda Pizazzo 02.jpg\nGreat Expotations - Fernanda Pizazzo.jpg\nGreat Expotations - Fernanda Pizazzo 00.jpg\n</gallery>\n{{Tangled}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Tangled characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Inventors]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
