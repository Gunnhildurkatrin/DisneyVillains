He was an eccentric game show host prior to becoming a supervillain. \n==Background==\n===Development===\nMr. Sparkles was at one point intended to appear as a villain in the original ''[[Big Hero 6]]'' feature film but was scrapped later in development. As with many other characters, Mr. Sparkles represents an element of Japanese pop-culture, in this case, bizarre physical challenge game shows popular on Japanese television since the 1980s such as ''Takeshi's Castle''. His show in the film was to have been called \"''The Super Sparkle Challenge Hour''\".\n\nIn ''[[The Art of Big Hero 6]]'', art director Scott Watanabe explained that he was developed as a potential main villain when [[Yokai]] was intended to be more redeemable, describing him as a \"dumpy, little, kid-like man that was super creepy and weird\" that wanted to control the world.\n\n==Role in the [[Big Hero 6: The Series|series]]==\n===Season one===\nMr. Sparkles first appears in the episode \"[[Mr. Sparkles Loses His Sparkle]]\". In it, Sparkles's popularity is threatened and eventually tarnished when a viral video of [[Mochi]], the Japanese bobtail of [[Aunt Cass|Cass]], overtakes his position as the most watched figure on the Internet. Mad with jealousy, Sparkles kidnaps Mochi and broadcasts his plot to send the cat into space should no one complete his challenge in time. [[Go Go Tomago]], [[Honey Lemon]], [[Wasabi]] and [[Fred (Big Hero 6)|Fred]] take on Sparkles's challenge, but all fail, save for Go Go. Instead of releasing Mochi as agreed, however, Sparkles launches the cat into space regardless. Although Mochi is saved by [[Hiro Hamada]], Sparkles accomplishes his goal of becoming a \"wanted celebrity\" by becoming a target for the police.\n\n===Season two===\nIn \"[[The Fate of the Roommates]]\", Sparkles\u2014now an underground supervillain\u2014organizes a street racing ring exclusively for the rich with his newfound partner, [[Yama (Big Hero 6)|Yama]]. In the end, Sparkles cons Yama into taking the blame while he escapes with the money. He then uses his illegal earnings to \"invest\" in [[Di Amara]], whom he heard about can grant villains special abilities.\n\nIn \"[[Something Fluffy]]\", Mr. Sparkles was modified by Liv with the ability to control the Mayoi as part of Liv's plot to gain the public's faith in Sycorax. After the Mayoi began causing disarray in the city, Mr. Sparkles pretended to be the creator of the monsters and previous mutated villains. Then relieving his mutated form and took control of the Mayoi by turning them into their final form. However, Liv arrived with a \"cure\" that turned the Mayoi back into their infantile state. Big Hero 6 used this cure, and soon enough, all the Mayoi were turned back. The Mayoi rescued Mr. Sparkles and he retreated with the creatures, shouting that he would bring forth more mutants to further Liv's cover.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Patton Oswalt previously worked with [[Mark McCorkle]] and [[Bob Schooley]] on ''[[Kim Possible]]'', in which he voiced [[Professor Dementor]].\n*Mr. Sparkles is alluded to in background advertisements prior to his debut episode.\n*Mr. Sparkles' bowl cut is actually a wig; he is balding underneath.\n*He shares some similarities with the [[Marvel Comics]] villain [[Arcade]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nMr Sparkles Original Concept Art.jpg|Concept from the film's production\nMr. Sparkles Loses His Sparkle 7.jpg\nMr. Sparkles Loses His Sparkle 22.jpg\nMr. Sparkles Loses His Sparkle 22.png\nMr. Sparkles Loses His Sparkle 17.png\nMr. Sparkles Loses His Sparkle 18.png\nMr. Sparkles Loses His Sparkle 24.png\nMr. Sparkles Loses His Sparkle 25.png\nMr. Sparkles Loses His Sparkle 19.png\nMr. Sparkles Loses His Sparkle 23.png\nMr. Sparkles Loses His Sparkle-17.JPG\nThe Fate of Roommates (12).png\nLie Detector 13.png\nLie Detector 14.png\nLie Detector 29.JPG\nCity of Monsters - Mutant Villains.jpg\nCity of Monsters - Cured Villains.jpg\nThe Present (14).jpg\nA Fresh Sparkles still 1.png|Mr. Sparkles becomes good\n</gallery>\n\n{{Big Hero 6}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sparkles, Mr.}}\n[[Category:Big Hero 6 characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Villains]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Television hosts]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Mutants]]\n\n[[Category:Plants]]\n[[Category:Deleted characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]"
