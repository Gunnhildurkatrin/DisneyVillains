"[[File:Char_33889.jpg|thumb]]\n'''Shelton Gunnar Klutzberry''' ([[Jeff Bennett]]) is a character in ''[[The Replacements]]''. \n\n==History==\nHe is the stereotypical nerd at school. He is afraid of girls, and once had a relationship with Celebrity Starr. He also has an imaginary girlfriend named Zelda (since an imaginary girlfriend is all that he can handle). He often thinks of himself as cool & calls the others nerds. He is revealed to be very muscular and handsome when he takes his glasses off, but this is not to his advantage because he can't use contacts, and has to have heavy glasses (which causes him to appear weak and scrawny) that are so heavy they double as weights.\n\nHe always seems to be wherever Todd and Riley are. He sometimes just wants to be part of the group. In one episode, he is seen to have a giant pet tortoise. In another, he and his entire family are revealed to be Jewish. His voice and mannerisms are greatly similar to the famous comedian Jerry Lewis's character from the movie ''The Nutty Professor''. When he speaks of characteristics or actions, he clarifies them by saying \"with the\" and adding a list of adjectives and effects (etc. \"Victory is mine... with the winning, and the accomplishing, and the rubbing it in your face!\"). When he gets hurt, he usually says \"Hoigle!\"\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nThe Insecurity Guard (3).jpg\nThe Insecurity Guard (4).jpg\n-chitika close button-chitika close button.jpg|Shelton without his glasses.\nClaudiaJenniferSheldon2.png\nClaudiaJenniferSheldon1.png\nSheldon Attacked.PNG\n</gallery>\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n{{The Replacements}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Klutzberry, Shelton Gunnar}}\n[[Category:The Replacements characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Jewish characters]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
