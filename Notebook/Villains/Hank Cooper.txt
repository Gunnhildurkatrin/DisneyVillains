When picking the cars, Hank chooses [[Herbie]] who was thrown out by his previous and cruel owner. [[Simon Moore III|Simon Moore]]. After fixing up his engine, Hank prepares to race him but unfortunately he will not start. Suddenly just when a tow truck comes up from behind, Herbie springs to life and shows off his incredible speed to the audience and wins for Hank. Although victorious nobody seems to believe he was responsible for what Herbie did on the track.\n\nDuring the early course of the film, like [[Jim Douglas]] he keeps Herbie but doesn't believe that he has a mind of his own while others do like his friend, Roddy Martel. He also becomes jealous when people become more into Herbie than him.\n\nWhen Herbie goes out looking for him he finally comes to understand that he's alive and goes out to find him. Sadly he finds him all smashed up and left for dead.\n\nAt Herbie's funeral, Hank meets his previous owner Jim Douglas and his creator, [[Dr. Gustav Stumpfel]], who tell him they can rebuild him if they reshape his original parts. He spends day and night rebuilding his little friend non stop. He succeeds in bringing Herbie back but he is approached by Simon Moore who challenges him to a road race against both their little cars.\n\nWith Alex and Roddy as his co drivers, they race against the Scottish race driver and his evil bug [[Horace (The Love Bug)|Horace]] and like in the original film comes in first and third place after the little car gets split in two. Hank and Alex drive away on a date and share a kiss.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nHank-Cooper-1.png\nThe Love Bug 1997 2.jpg\nHank-Cooper-3.png\nHank-Cooper-4.png\nHerbie bruce campbell.jpg|Hank with Herbie\nHank, Alex and Herbie.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Love Bug}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cooper, Hank}}\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Mechanics]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Protagonists]]\n[[Category:The Love Bug characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
