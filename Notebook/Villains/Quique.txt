Quique is rude to Isabel her entire first day for her smarts and mocks her dream to enter the Science Academy causing her to go home brokenhearted. The next day, Quique is confused yet amused when Isabel acts very similar to him. When [[Princess Elena]]\u00a0arrives, Quique is delighted when she announces that she going on the field trip too. At the Crystal Caverns, Quique mocks the Caverns as a giant hole but is quickly put in his place by Elena who tells him to listen to\u00a0Se\u00f1orita Marisol. When Isabel mocks Elena, he is horrified yet amused. Inside the Caverns, Quique spots an unexplored area and takes Isabel and Amara with him into it. The trio have fun playing in it until an unstable crystal collapses under them and they get stuck on a lily pad. When Elena arrives to rescue them, Isabel and Amara jump to her but Quique is too scared. Elena jumps to him but the stem holding the lily pad in place snaps and they float away. Isabel and Amara save them and Isabel gets them out by making Avaloran Rubber which they put on their shoes to bounce to safety. Upon rejoining the rest of the class,\u00a0Se\u00f1orita Marisol punishes the trio by sending them back to school to clean the schoolyard. Quique is unhappy about this until Isabel and Elena make it fun.\n\n{{Elena of Avalor}}\n[[Category:Elena of Avalor characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
