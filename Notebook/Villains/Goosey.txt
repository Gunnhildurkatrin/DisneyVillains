She likes running around, eating Gooseberry Pie and being free. When competition comes around she will lay smaller than normal gold egg, though it later transpires that this happened only because of the pressure Jack placed on her, not allowing her to roam free. She also likes being goose-sat by [[Humpty]]. She was previously owned by the [[The Giant (Goldie and Bear)|giant]] and was taken by Jack.\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Goldie & Bear}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Articles needing improvement]]\n[[Category:Disney Junior characters]]\n[[Category:Goldie & Bear characters]]\n[[Category:Geese]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]"
