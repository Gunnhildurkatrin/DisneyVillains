He is shown to be adept at prowling, as most cats are, and very sneaky\u00a0as seen when\u00a0he tries to catch and eat [[Sasha]], but is stopped and berated by [[Peter (Make Mine Music)|Peter]].\u00a0He is shown to have a great fear of the [[Wolf (Make Mine Music)|wolf]], as he panics at the first sign of it and runs to Peter, though he is brave enough to let Peter lower him down with a rope and tie\u00a0it\u00a0to the wolf's tail to save Sasha. He\u00a0is also the only one who stays with Peter throughout the whole ordeal, with [[Sonia]] seeming to get eaten and Sasha going to find some [[Misha, Yasha, and Vladimir|hunters]] for help.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Make Mine Music]]''===\nIvan\u00a0is first seen trying to eat Sasha, but Peter stops\u00a0him just in time and demands him to release Sasha. Peter then berates Ivan, who seems to feel ashamed. He later accompanies Peter, Sasha, and Sonia to hunt down and capture the wolf. When Ivan suddenly notices the wolf, he panics\u00a0and runs to Peter. Later, when Sonia supposedly gets eaten by the wolf,\u00a0Ivan mourns with the rest of the gang. He later shows bravery when Peter lowers him down with a rope and ties\u00a0it to the wolf's tail to save Sasha from getting eaten, after\u00a0which Sasha goes to some hunters for help. Ivan can be seen in the parade with Peter at the end of the segment.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Ivan is represented in the music by a clarinet.\n\n{{Make Mine Music}}\n\n[[fr:Ivan le chat]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Make Mine Music characters]]\n[[Category:Hunters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Russian characters]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Anti-heroes]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Peter and the Wolf]]"
