He has a daughter named Patience, and a wife. He was a former US Cold War secret agent named Epsilon. A recurring joke with the chief is when he takes a villain away, he'll make a witty line that ends with jail, prison, etc. (e.g.: \"Let's go! You and droid boy have Front row seats.... IN JAIL!!!\"). He once tried to operate as a costumed superhero himself in the episode \"The Cheif's new groove,\" using the code-name 'Lawman', but made a hash of it since his 'gadgets' consisted of an umbrella and an eggwhisk.\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nLecheif.jpg|The Chief from Teamo Supremo\nWho Invited The Birthday Bandit.jpg\nLordDruidArrested.jpg\nDacheif.png|The Chief as he appears in the credits for Teamo Supremo\nChief and Trettiak.png|The Chief and his nemesis, Vladimir Trettiak\n</gallery>\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Teamo Supremo}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chief, The}}\n[[Category:Teamo Supremo characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Police officers]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Detectives]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]"
