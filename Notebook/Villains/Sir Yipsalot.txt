Instead of doggy treats, he enjoys pickle treats, as does Queen Delightful. Sir Yipsalot gets his name from the yipping sounds he makes going, \"Yip, yip, yip!\"\n\nAccording to Queen Delightful, Sir Yipsalot is well behaved but only in the right hands. In the wrong hands he can be very destructive and a major handful as [[Hildy Gloom|Hildy]] and [[Grim Gloom|Grim]]\u00a0found out when they held him for ransom against the Queen.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"150\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nQueen Delightful and the 7D.jpg\nQueen Delightful with the 7D.jpg\nLord Starchbottom and Queen Delightful 2.png\nSir-Yipsalot-and-the-Goose-1.png\nSir-Yipsalot-and-the-Goose-4.png\nSir-Yipsalot-and-the-Goose-5.png\nSleepytime-15.png\nStarchbottom Saves the Day.PNG\nItsy-Bitsy-Spider Fighters-1.png\nItsy-Bitsy-Spider-Fighters-5.png\nItsy-Bitsy-Spider-Fighters-4.png\nSurprise 3.jpg\nYipsalot owl.jpg\nYipsalot frightened.jpg\nJollybells.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{The 7D}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Yipsalot, Sir}}\n[[Category:The 7D characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Frogs]]\n[[Category:Transformed characters]]\n[[Category:Characters Under Spells]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
