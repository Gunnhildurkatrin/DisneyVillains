Being the governor, he runs the state that the show takes place in, but always calls up\u00a0[[Captain Crandall|Crandall]],\u00a0[[Skate Lad|Hector]], and\u00a0[[Rope Girl|Brenda]]\u00a0to take care of any\u00a0villains\u00a0that are running amok in the state. His voice is provided by\u00a0[[Martin Mull]].\n\nKevin apparently seems to have his mind stuck in the\u00a01970s. This is made note of in several episodes, and is even made obvious by his dialogue. Examples of his 1970s dialect include \"Hey, you kids have some funky fresh moves!\" and \"You kids really have your groove thang goin' today!\" Also, the suit he wears when dancing in the show's closing credits is obviously 1970s-esque. It has also been revealed that he is\u00a0color-blind.\n\nKevin is said to have a rather large ego. This is especially evident in one episode where he is ousted from his title by\u00a0[[Helius Inflato]]. Also among Governor Kevin's personal enemies is high school rival William Aloysius Wynn, whom he beat for high school president. Wynn since became a rival governor candidate with the alias Will 2 Wynn, getting support from several of\u00a0Teamo's enemies.\n\nOddly enough, Kevin is drawn with eyelashes, a trait that is uncommon among cartoon men. These eyelashes, however, could perhaps be a side-effect to his aforementioned color-blind. In spite of having eyelashes, Kevin has been shown to be straight. His girlfriend from high school, Viva Voom, was featured in the show's obscure Valentine's Day episode. They don't usually see each other often due to their careers, but still have their relationship.\n[[File:Governorkevin.png|left|thumb|291x291px|Governor Kevin as he appears in the credits for Teamo Supremo]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kevin}}\n{{Teamo Supremo}}\n[[Category:Teamo Supremo characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Politicians]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]"
