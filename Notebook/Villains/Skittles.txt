She has big eyes, a small beak and \"hair\" on the back of her head.\n\n==Role==\nWhen [[Scrooge McDuck]], [[Launchpad McQuack]], [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]] are imprisoned in Antarctica by a penguin army, [[Webby Vanderquack|Webby]] and [[Bentina Beakley|Mrs. Beakley]] meet up with Skittles. She agrees to help them break their friends out when Webby gives her a scarf, which she loves because it has so many colors, as everything around her is white snow and ice.\n\nShe helps Webby get around the museum by disguising her as a penguin. The two can\u2019t get the map out due to being encased in ice, but they manage to draw a copy with colorful crayons\n\n==Trivia==\n*Her name may be a parody to a brand of fruit-flavored sweets of the [[Wikipedia:Skittles (confectionery)|same name]], given her kind nature.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nEp04 A04.jpg\nHeyLardo.jpg\nOfCourseWellStay.jpg\nByeByeBlubber.jpg\nIceCar.jpg\nep04_A11.jpg\nCrayolas.jpg\nskitty1.jpg\nskitty2.jpg|Skittles parachutes down safely.\n</gallery>\n\n{{DuckTales}}\n[[Category:Penguins]]\n[[Category:DuckTales characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Donald Duck universe characters]]"
