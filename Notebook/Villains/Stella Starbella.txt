Despite her feeble appearance, she was once the greatest heroine in the galaxy and the arch-enemy of the galaxy's former greatest villain,\u00a0[[Mandrake the Malfeasant]].\n\n== Personality ==\nStarbella is a very feeble and possibly senile old woman who often says nonsensical things. Despite this, she is still a very heroic and competent crime fighter who, despite her mental state, is still a great superhero in peak physical condition.\n\nShe joins Wander and a group of rebels to fight [[Lord Dominator]] in \"[[The End of the Galaxy]]\".\n\n== Trivia ==\n* She is based on and is an amalgamation of Stella Star (from the cult classic ''Starcrash)'' and Barbarella (a space-travelling comic book heroine).\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Wander Over Yonder}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stella Starbella}}\n[[Category:Wander Over Yonder characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Superheroes]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Disney XD characters]]"
