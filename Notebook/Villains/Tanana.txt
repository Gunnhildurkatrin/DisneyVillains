As such, she expects the same of her tribe, stating \"there is no trading\" when it comes to totems, and impresses the meanings of the totems into those who come of age but that they must learn how to live by what their totems represent.\n\nShe has a sense of humor and a curious side (shown when she \"examined\" Kenai after he'd been turned into a bear as one of the multiple instances of violating his \"personal space\") and possesses great insight.\n\n==Role in the film==\nTanana gives tribe members their totems when they are of age. As Kenai awakes as a bear after being swept along by a river, she tells him that he must travel to the \"mountain where the lights touch the earth\" to be changed back into a man by [[Sitka]]. After Kenai chooses to remain a bear and earns his title as a man through his love for [[Koda]], Tanana leads the ceremony where he officially becomes a man.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\">\nbrother-bear-disneyscreencaps.com-124.jpg\nbrother-bear-disneyscreencaps.com-140.jpg\nbrother-bear-disneyscreencaps.com-905.jpg\nbrother-bear-disneyscreencaps.com-952.jpg\nbrother-bear-disneyscreencaps.com-1017.jpg\nbrother-bear-disneyscreencaps.com-2910.jpg\nbrother-bear-disneyscreencaps.com-2918.jpg\nbrother-bear-disneyscreencaps.com-3043.jpg\nbrother-bear-disneyscreencaps.com-9180.jpg\nNovember28th.png|Her [[Disneystrology]] page\nTanana Clipart.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Brother Bear}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Brother Bear characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters in Disney parks]]\n[[Category:Magic Users]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric characters]]\n[[Category:Mentors]]\n[[Category:Native American characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Canadian characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]"
