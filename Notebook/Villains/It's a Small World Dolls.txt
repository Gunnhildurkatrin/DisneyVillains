All of them are child-like dolls which live in miniature recreations of different regions of the globe, all tied together by boats and rivers.\n\nDue to the success of the attraction, the \"It's a Small World\" attraction was later constructed at [[Magic Kingdom]], [[Tokyo Disneyland]], [[Disneyland Paris]], and [[Hong Kong Disneyland]], still featuring the dolls throughout the attraction.

The leisurely boat ride turns into a flume similar to\u00a0[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]\u00a0and\u00a0[[Splash Mountain]].\n\n==== [[Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension]] ====\nIn\u00a0Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension,\u00a0[[Heinz Doofenshmirtz]]\u00a0is sent through a theme park-style dark ride as he rides a chair to\u00a0his second dimension counterpart's office. He rides past animatronic characters and\u00a0scenes that parody It's a Small World with a Dr. Doofenshmirtz theme as the dolls sing \"[[He's Doof]]\".\n\n==== [[Tomorrowland (film)|Tomorrowland]] ====\nIn the movie\u00a0Tomorrowland, the\u00a0[[1964 New York World's Fair|1964&nbsp;World's Fair]] version of the attraction is seen in\u00a0[[Frank Walker]]'s flashback.\n\n=== Television ===\n\n==== 2004 Disneyland Advertisement ====\nThey dolls notably appeared in a 2004 advertisement for Disneyland which revolved around the Hitchhiking Ghosts going on attractions throughout the [[California]] parks. After joyously going on [[Matterhorn Bobsleds]] and the [[The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror|Twilight Zone Tower of Terror]], they go on It's a Small World and are horrified by the dolls.\n\n==== [[Phineas and Ferb]] ====\nThe dolls were parodied in the\u00a0Phineas and Ferb\u00a0episode \"[[The Lake Nose Monster]]\" as \"Lair Entrance: The Ride\", a ride inside the entrance of an [[Organization Without a Cool Acronym|OWCA]] lair.\n\n==== [[It's a Small World: The Animated Series]] ====\nThe Small World dolls are the lead characters in this show, namely children by the names of Maruma, Ashley, Luis, Zanele, Ling, Harold and Wazoh.\n\n=== Video-Games ===\n\n==== [[Kinect Disneyland Adventures]] ====\nThe dolls serve as the central cast for the It's a Small World segments of this game in-which players are guided by a sailor doll on their cruise of the dolls' small world.\n\n=== Printed Materials ===\n\n==== [[Kingdom Keepers]] ====\nIn Kingdom Keepers I: Disney After Dark, the Small World Dolls attack the lead characters when they ride on It's a Small World. The dolls here are puppets of [[Maleficent]] and the [[The Overtakers|Overtakers]], being described as having teeth like piranhas which they use to try and tear the heroes apart.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The Small World dolls are often the subject of mockery due to many guests seeing them as very creepy. Namely due to their uncanny appearances, empty eyes, and the eerie nature of their repetitive joyous singing. It may also be ''pediophobia'', the fear of dolls which is fairly common.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nIt's a Small World Tomorrowland.jpg\nSmallworldsphinx.jpg\nF90d56d473 b.jpg\n0e0b6d2f80ca61b5001a6be0565e20e64.jpg\nBambi Thumper It's a Small World.jpg|[[Bambi (character)|Bambi]] and [[Thumper]] (Hong Kong Disneyland)\nSmall World Elsa.jpg|[[Elsa]] (Tokyo Disneyland)\nit's a small world - Disneyland Alice in Wonderland photo(c)Disney_0.jpg|[[Alice]] and the [[White Rabbit]] (Disneyland, Tokyo Disneyland)\nSmall World Merida.jpg|[[Merida]], [[Harris, Hubert, and Hamish]] (Tokyo Disneyland)\nHercules Small World.jpg|[[Hercules (character)|Hercules]] (Tokyo Disneyland)\nSmall World Rapunzel.jpg|[[Rapunzel]] and [[Pascal]] (Tokyo Disneyland)\nSmall World Cinderella.jpg|[[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]] with [[Jaq and Gus]] (Disneyland)\nSmall World Cindy and Charming.jpg|[[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]] and [[Prince Charming]] (Hong Kong Disneyland, Tokyo Disneyland)\nPinocchio and Jiminy Cricket Small World.jpg|Pinocchio and [[Jiminy Cricket]] (Disneyland)\nPinocchio Small World TDL.jpg|[[Pinocchio (character)|Pinocchio]] (Tokyo Disneyland)\nMarie Small World.jpg|[[Marie]] (Tokyo Disneyland, Hong Kong Disneyland)\nPeter Pan Small World TDL.jpg|[[Tinker Bell]], [[Wendy Darling]] and [[Peter Pan]] (Tokyo Disneyland)\nBaloo Mowgli Small World TDL.jpg|[[Baloo]] and [[Mowgli]] (Tokyo Disneyland, Hong Kong Disneyland)\nAladdin_It's_a_Small_World.jpg|[[Aladdin (character)|Aladdin]], [[Jasmine]] and [[Abu]] (Hong Kong Disneyland)\nTimon_and_Simba_Small_World.png|[[Simba]] and [[Timon]] (with Pumbaa out of frame) (Disneyland)\nLion_King_It's_a_Small_World.jpg|[[Simba]], [[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]] (Hong Kong Disneyland, Tokyo Disneyland)\n Toy Story It's a Small World.jpg|[[Radiator Springs]] from ''[[Cars]]'', [[Woody]], [[Jessie]] and [[Bullseye]] from ''[[Toy Story 2]]'' (Hong Kong Disneyland)\nMoana Small World.jpg|[[Moana (character)|Moana]], [[Pua (Moana)|Pua]] and [[Heihei]] (Tokyo Disneyland)\nFinding Nemo Small World.jpg|[[Dory]], [[Nemo]] and [[Marlin]] (Tokyo Disneyland)\nThree Caballeros.jpg|[[Jos\u00e9 Carioca]], [[Donald Duck]] and [[Panchito Pistoles]] (Tokyo Disneyland)\nSmallworldpocahontascharacters.jpg|[[Pocahontas (character)|Pocahontas]], [[Meeko]] and [[Flit]] (Hong Kong Disneyland)\nReturnjafar-disneyscreencaps.com-1909.jpg|The \"Small World\" dolls as one of [[Genie]]'s transformations.\n</gallery>\n\n{{Kingdom Keepers}}\n{{Tomorrowland (film)}}\n{{Phineas and Ferb}}\n[[Category:Kingdom Keepers characters]]\n[[Category:Overtakers]]\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:It's a Small World]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Phineas and Ferb characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Kim Possible characters]]\n[[Category:Tomorrowland characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Avengers Campus characters]]"
