"[[File:Country_Kitty.png|thumb]]'''Country Kitty''' is was a member of the all-girl group known as the [[Stray Kitties]]. She is played by Skyler Vallo.\n\n==Background Information==\nShe appeared in \"[[Solos & Stray Kitties]]\". Country Kitty's shtick is primary dressing in a cowgirl uniform with cat-ears, and line-dancing, in spite of the fact that the music she dances to is strictly standard contemporary girl-group pop rather than country and western music. She also tends to profile herself on wearing an excessive amount of makeup, and feels threatened when she sees [[Ally Dawson]] more heavily made up with her while dressed as \"Wicked Kitty.\"\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n{{Austin & Ally}}\n[[Category:Austin & Ally characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
