"[[File:Conrad_Fleem.jpg|thumb|Conrad Fleem showing his face in \"Ir-replaceable\"]]\n'''Conrad Fleem''' ([[Jeff Bennett]]) is a character in ''[[The Replacements]]''. \n\n==History==\nHe is the owner and founder of Fleemco, the company that gives replacements.\u00a0He is the biological uncle of [[Todd Daring|Todd]] and [[Riley Daring]] (revealed in \"[[Irreplaceable]]\") which Todd figures out because he says \"Don't Judge Me!\" like Todd and his craze for sweets like Riley. He couldn't adopt them because he doesn't know how to raise kids, so he sent the replacements, [[Dick Daring]] and [[Agent K]].\n\nHis brother, Todd and Riley's father, never listened to anyone, which ended up resulting in his children becoming orphans. Conrad wanted his niece and nephew to learn to know better than their father, so he created the Replacements program for them to teach them that lesson.\n\nHe also points out that he wore his disguise, because the phones the kids have are video phones. \n\nIn the series finale, episode ''[[Irreplaceable]]'' after the defeat of [[Dr. Scorpius]], Conrad invites Todd and Riley to co-run the Replacement Program for other kids.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nConrad Fleem2.jpg|Conrad Fleem without showing his face\nFleemlin.png|Conrad Fleem as Fleemlin the Magician in \"[[Serf's Up]]\"\n28686000 1704479656306058 1521437266662215084 n.jpg|Conrad revealed to be Todd and Riley's Uncle\n28783479 1704480076306016 2446887995197103462 n.jpg|Conrad with his nephew and niece\n</gallery>\n{{CharacterStub}}\n\n{{The Replacements}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fleem, Conrad}}\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:The Replacements characters]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Uncles]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
