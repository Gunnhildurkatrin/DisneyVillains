It did not have brow or nasal horns; instead it had a thick, bumpy, spongy pad of bone along the upper surface of its flattened face. This bony pad ran from the front of its nose back to above its eyes. The skull of Pachyrhinosaurus was massive; only [http://science.howstuffworks.com/triceratops.htm Triceratops], [http://science.howstuffworks.com/pentaceratops.htm Pentaceratops], [http://animals.howstuffworks.com/dinosaurs/chasmosaurus.htm Chasmosaurus], and [http://science.howstuffworks.com/torosaurus.htm Torosaurus] had larger skulls. Pachyrhinosaurus was the largest centrosaurine ceratopsian, a subfamily of ceratopsians generally defined by large nose horns and bosses and generally short frills.\n\nCharles Sternberg named Pachyrhinosaurus canadensis from three partial skulls found in southern Alberta. Other species of Pachyrhinosaurus, such as Pachyrhinosaurus perotorum have been found as far north as Northern Alaska. Pachyrhinosaurus means \"thick-nose reptile\"; the name refers to the bony facial pad, called the boss. Because skulls of this [http://science.howstuffworks.com/dinosaur.htm dinosaur] are rare, and because of their odd, gnarled facial boss, some paleontologists thought these specimens were pathological; they thought the facial pad was formed because a nasal horn broke off and then healed over. So they thought the facial boss was a \"scar.\" Paleontologists recently uncovered a large bone bed with many Pachyrhinosaurus specimens in north central Alberta. This proves that the facial pad is a normal feature of Pachyrhinosaurus and not a scar.\n\nThe rest of the skull of Pachyrhinosaurus looked very much like that of other centrosaurine ceratopsians such as [http://science.howstuffworks.com/centrosaurus.htm Centrosaurus], [http://science.howstuffworks.com/monoclonius.htm Monoclonius], and [http://science.howstuffworks.com/styracosaurus.htm Styracosaurus]. Like them, Pachyrhinosaurus had a short frill, a deep face, and a short beak. Pachyrhinosaurus was also closely related to [http://science.howstuffworks.com/brachyceratops.htm Brachyceratops] and [http://science.howstuffworks.com/avaceratops.htm Avaceratops].\n\n==[[Dinosaur]]==\nPachyrhinosaurus is featured in many scenes in Dinosaur. One notable scene was when the [[Carnotaurus]] attacked because it was unable to run fast like the Iguanodons or the Parasaurolophus, where a Pachyrhinosaurus ended up as its victim. Later, many Pachyrhinosaurus appear in the herd that [[Kron]] leads, where one of them rams into [[Aladar]] when he first runs into the herd. At the end of the film, they reach the Nesting Grounds with the other dinosaurs, and they live in peace and harmony, joining in the victory roars.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"medium\" position=\"center\">\nDinosaur-disneyscreencaps_com-277.jpg\nDinosaur-disneyscreencaps com-556.jpg|A whole herd of Pachyrhinosaurus drinking near the river while a [[Pteranodon]] swoops down & carries off [[Aladar|Aladar's]] egg\nDinosaur-disneyscreencaps com-622.jpg|Several Pachyrhinosaurus Grazing along with 4 Adult [[Parasaurolophus]], 2 [[Iguanodon]] & 3 [[Brachiosaurus]]\nPachyrhinosaurus.jpg\ndinosaur-disneyscreencaps.com-157.jpg|Pachyrhinosaurus drinking and grazing with [[Iguanodon]], [[Parasaurolophus]], and [[Brachiosaurus]] \n</gallery>\n\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Disney's Dinosaur was the first major film to feature Pachyrhinosaurus and make it well-known to the public. It is one of the few theatrically released films to also feature Pachyrhinosaurus, with the other being the 2013 20th Century Fox Film, Walking With Dinosaurs 3D.\n**[[20th Century Fox]] is part of Disney now since Coincidentally, Walking with Dinosaurs is now owned by Disney following their acquisition of 20th Century Studios (formerly known as 20th Century Fox).\n\n* Some scientists and artists have suggested that the boss on Pachyrhinosaurus' nose was the base huge horn made of keratin (the same material in modern rhinoceros horns). However, no evidence exists for this.\n\n* In spite of being shown alongside [[Styracosaurus]] in Disney's Dinosaur, in reality Pachyrhinosaurus lived a few million years later than Styracosaurus and may be its descendant.\n* Pachyrhinosaurus has one of the widest ranges of any ceratopsians, being known from Montana to as far north as Alberta, Canada and Alaska.\n* Pachyrhinosaurus has more species in its genus than almost any other known ceratopsian. It is the most speciose (species rich) genus of the centrosaurine branch of ceratopsians.\n\n{{Dinosaur}}\n[[Category:Dinosaurs]]\n[[Category:Dinosaur characters]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric animals]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]"
