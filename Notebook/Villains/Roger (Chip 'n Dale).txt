He is the late Lord Howard Baskerville's favorite youngest son, [[Lord Howie]]'s younger brother, and [[MacDuff]]'s owner. By using the fact that their father's will was lost, his evil brother oppressed him in every way.\n\n==Role in the episode==\nRoger was first seen washing clothes and was glad to see [[MacDuff]] again. Then, his evil older brother, [[Lord Howie]] vowed revenge for letting Roger let MacDuff in his house to search for their father's lost will by having MacDuff taken away by the sheriff. Roger then protested there was no need to throw him or MacDuff out of the house.\n\nThen, MacDuff told Roger that Lord Howie was about to shoot the Rescue Rangers so they ran over to the house at once. Lord Howie always complained that Roger was always their father, Lord Howard Baskerville's favorite son, but as long as Lord Howie had the will, he assured that Roger and MacDuff would end up living in the streets.\n\nMacDuff was then taken away by the sheriff. The two brothers fought over the will in the mud and then, the Sheriff saw the will thanks to the Rescue Rangers and decided that MacDuff is to be trusted to Roger as the rightful owner of Baskerville Manor; much to Roger's joy and Lord Howie's chagrin.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nvlcsnap-2015-04-16-20h44m53s007.png\nPotb2.png\nvlcsnap-2015-04-16-21h01m26s244.png\nvlcsnap-2015-04-16-21h01m40s646.png\nPotb9.png\nvlcsnap-2015-04-16-21h02m21s564.png\nvlcsnap-2015-06-16-16h11m28s938.png\nvlcsnap-2015-04-16-21h02m48s980.png\nvlcsnap-2015-04-16-21h02m56s238.png\n</gallery>\n{{Rescue Rangers}}\n[[Category:Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Servants]]\n[[Category:English characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Lords]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]"
