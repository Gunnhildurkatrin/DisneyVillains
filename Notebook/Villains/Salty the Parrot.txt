He accompanied Mary on many adventures with Mary even creating miniature scuba suits so Salty could join her underwater.  Salty attended the maiden launch of her RV Oceaneer Lab as-well as assisting her in her treasure-hunting in the Caribbean.\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n=== Oceaneer Labs ===\nSalty is portrayed in a large number of portraits and stories at the Oceaneer labs.\n\n=== [[Miss Adventure Falls]] ===\nThe ship possessed by Mary which ran afoul of [[Typhoon Lagoon]] in this attraction is called the ''M.S. Salty IV''.  This was likely done as an homage to Mary's former pet parrot.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Salty's eyepatch, green feathers and affiliation with piracy in the Caribbean might be an homage to the [[Barker Bird]] from [[Pirates of the Caribbean (attraction)|Pirates of the Caribbean]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"185\">\nMary and Salty.jpg\nOceaneer Maiden Voyage.png\nOceaneer Dive.png\nMaryCastawayCay.png\n25142766598 19e15736c8 k.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Society of Explorers and Adventurers}}\n[[Category:Parrots]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:S.E.A. characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
