He was a trading company owner, the husband of [[Helen Kingsleigh]] and the father of [[Margaret Kingsleigh|Margaret]] and [[Alice Kingsleigh|Alice]].\n\n==Background==\nCharles Kingsleigh was a businessman that commanded a trading company that operated beyond Great Britain. He had a dream of setting trading posts as far as long as in Rangoon, Bangkok and Jakarta, an idea strongly opposed by his partners because of the financial risks involved.\n\nAt some point in his life, he married a woman called [[Helen Kingsleigh|Helen]] and had two daughters with her, [[Margaret Kingsleigh|Margaret]] and [[Alice Kingsleigh|Alice]]. He maintained a specially close relationship with Alice, the youngest one, because of their matching personalities. Alice, as Charles himself, had a vivid imagination and big dreams of her own. Her imagination used to sometimes oppress her with nightmares. When it occurred, Charles comforted Alice with kindly words. He used to say that he sometimes believed in six impossible things before breakfast, a motto that Alice carried to her adulthood.\n\nHe died at some point between 1855 and 1868. It is not clear if he lived enough to see his eldest daughter, Margaret, marry a man called Lowell. After his death, his wife sold his trading company to one of his closest partners, [[Lord Ascot]], and later, Alice went up to become an apprentice within the company, thus following Charles' footsteps.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''===\nIn 1855, Charles is trying to sell his project of setting trading posts in Asia (specifically Rangoon, Bangkok, Jakarta) to his partners. His talk is interrupted by his 6-year-old daughter [[Alice Kingsleigh|Alice]], who just had a recurring nightmare again. She tells her father she saw many strange creatures, including a [[Uilleam|dodo bird]], a [[Nivins McTwisp|white rabbit wearing a waistcoat]], a [[Chessur|smiling cat]] and a [[Absolem|blue caterpillar]]. Alice wonders if she has gone mad, to which Charles responds she has. He, however, comforts her by saying that this is not a bad thing, because all the best people are mad. Thirteen years later, he died of unknown causes.\n\n===''[[Once Upon a Time in Wonderland]]''===\nAlice's father Edwin appears in the series. After Alice leaves for Wonderland and is presumed dead. When she returns, Edwin has her placed under the psychiatric care of [[Dr. Lydgate]]. He also remarries, and gains a new [[Alice's Sister|daughter]]. Edwin is eventually convinced Wonderland exists, after he is transported there with his daughter. He is later seen attending Alice's wedding to [[Cyrus (Once Upon a Time in Wonderland)|Cyrus]].\n\n{{Stubsection}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nOnce Upon a Time in Wonderland - 1x06 - Who's Alice? - Photography - Alice and Edwin.jpg|Alice with her father in ''Once Upon a Time in Wonderland''\nOnce Upon a Time in Wonderland - 1x07 - Bad Blood - Photography - Edwin.jpg\nOnce Upon a Time in Wonderland - 1x06 - Who's Alice? - Edwin.jpg\n</gallery>\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Alice in Wonderland}}\n{{Once Upon a Time}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kingsleigh, Charles}}\n[[Category:Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Character stubs]]\n[[Category:Spouses]]\n[[Category:Once Upon a Time characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
