He is the original owner of Mrs. Jumbo before selling her to [[V.A. Vandevere]] at Dreamland.\n\n==Background==\nBrugelbecker serves as [[Mrs. Jumbo]]'s original owner before being purchased by the Medici Bros. Circus by [[Ringmaster| Max Medici]]. After Mrs. Jumbo gave birth to [[Dumbo (character)|Dumbo]], Max Medici plans to contact Brugelbecker about having an unusual elephant at the circus to his worry. When he approaches Max at the circus grounds, Max tells him that he has a moral responsibility to buy back Mrs. Jumbo, to which Brugelbecker agrees in a plan to purchase her at half price. After Dumbo's act was a success, Brugelbecker later sold Mrs. Jumbo to V.A. Vandevere at Dreamland where Mrs. Jumbo is exhibited at Nightmare Island, leading Holt, Joe, Milly, and the rest of the performers to devise a plan to rescue her.\n\n==Role in the film==\n\nWhen [[Holt Farrier]] and his children [[Joe Farrier|Joe]] and [[Milly Farrier|Milly]] approach [[Mrs. Jumbo]] in the stable, [[Ringmaster|Max Medici]] explains to them that he brought her from Brugelbecker in Biloxi just as Max explains to Holt that Mrs. Jumbo is about to have a baby. After Mrs. Jumbo gives birth to Baby Jumbo, Max asks [[Rongo the Strongo|Rongo]] to contact Brugelbecker, devising a message to the strongman to give Max a refund due to Max feeling disappointed upon looking at Baby Jumbo's appearance without advertising him. However, instead of listening to him, Max tells Rongo that he should never tell the ringmaster without checking with him first as it can cause problems to the Medici Bros. Circus as Rongo drops the papers in shock.\n\nThe next day, Brugelbecker brings his truck and arrives at the circus grounds where he sees the performers rebuilding the tent due to Mrs. Jumbo's rampage. Max discusses with him about the incident last night as he shows Brugelbecker an article about the incident from last night, explaining to him that he has a moral responsibility to buy the elephant that Max is talking about and as a result, [[Dumbo (character)|Dumbo]] is excluded from the elephant act and is put into the clown act, to which he agrees with Max, explaining to him that he will buy Mrs. Jumbo in half price. As a result, Mrs. Jumbo is purchased back by her original owner as Dumbo mournfully reacts to see his mother being taken away as Brugelbecker takes her away just before bidding a sad farewell to his mother. As a result, Hans Brugelbecker has sold Mrs. Jumbo to [[V.A. Vandevere]] to Dreamland, in which the circus moves to Arkansas where Vandevere's headquarters are at. Mrs. Jumbo was later displayed in the Nightmare Island attraction, leading a plan for Holt, his children, and the circus performers to reunite Mrs. Jumbo back to her son and release the two elephants back into the wild.\n\nIt is unknown of what happened to Brugelbecker afterwards, even after Mrs. Jumbo reunited with her son and was later released back into the wild.\n\n{{Dumbo}} \n[[Category:Dumbo characters]]\n[[Category:Live-action characters]]\n[[Category:Characters introduced in remakes]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]"
