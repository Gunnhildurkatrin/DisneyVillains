He is mostly seen to mirror [[Phoebus]]' horse, [[Achilles]].\n\n==Background==\nVery little is known about Snowball, except that he appears to be a breed of draft horse, built as muscular, and hulking. He is loyal to his master, however, and can't be considered truly evil as he does not have a human-based personality like other animals in Disney films are sometimes seen to have, although he does always appear to have an angry snarl on his face, hinting that he does have some sort of dark personality.\n\nIn the audio commentary of the DVD, film directors [[Kirk Wise]] and [[Gary Trousdale]] and film producer [[Don Hahn]] revealed the name of Frollo's horse to be Snowball.\n\n==Role in the film==\nSnowball appears only a handful of times in the film. During the opening scene, he is with Claude Frollo chasing after the [[Quasimodo's mother|gypsy woman]] who is holding baby [[Quasimodo]]. In one scene, he gives a harsh glare to [[Phoebus]]' horse, [[Achilles]]. When Phoebus rebels against Frollo at the windmill, Esmeralda throws a stone at Snowball's butt thrusting Frollo off, then Phoebus steals Snowball in order to escape. He is immediately recovered by Frollo after Phoebus is wounded and thrown off the horse.\n\nIt is not known what happened to him by the end of the movie.\n\n==Trivia==\n*His name is slightly ironic, as he is a black sable horse, whereas snowballs are usually white.\n*He is a Friesian horse.\n*In ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', [[Gaston]] rallies the mob while riding a horse which bears a striking resemblance to Snowball.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nSnowball Close Up.jpg\nSnowball Close Up 2.jpg\nSnowball.jpg|<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Snowball in pursuit of [[Quasimodo's mother]]</div>\n</gallery>\n\n{{The Hunchback of Notre Dame}}\n[[nl:Sneeuwbal]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Horses]]\n[[Category:Henchmen]]\n[[Category:The Hunchback of Notre Dame characters]]\n[[Category:Character stubs]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]"
