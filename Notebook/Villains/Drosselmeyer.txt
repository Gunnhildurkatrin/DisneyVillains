Clara then enters Drosselmeyer's workshop and upon gazing at his owl, he explains that his owl is able to see everything. Noticing the swan carousel was moving backwards, Clara manages to fix the broken mechanism to which after Clara fixes the carousel for him and Drosselmeyer activates it, Drosselmeyer praises her for fixing it. She then asks him if he has the key that opens Marie's last gift for her to which the conversation is interrupted when the clock strikes the midnight of Christmas Eve. Drosselmeyer summons his owl to keep an eye on Clara and later tells the guests that he presents them their gifts after a ballet performance.\n\nAs Clara returns home, Drosselmeyer approaches her to which he explains to her that her mother [[Marie Stahlbaum|Marie]] was the cleverest inventor she knew just before Clara meets her father and apologizes to him.
