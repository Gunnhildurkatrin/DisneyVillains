He is an architect who designs and constructs secret headquarters for superheroes. He was hired Big Hero 6 to construct their secret base at the [[Frederickson Candy Co.]] He first appears in the season 2 episode, [[Hardlight]].\n\n==Background==\nRoddy Blair is an old friend of [[Mr. Frederickson|Boss Awesome]] who hired him constructing his secret chamber within his mansion.\n\n==History==\nIn \"[[Hardlight]]\", Roddy Blair is contracted by [[Fred (Big Hero 6)|Fred]] to renovate [[Frederickson Candy Co.]] into Big Hero 6's new headquarters. When he meets with the team, he directly asked which one was Fred, revealing his history with Boss Awesome.\n\nAs Roddy got to work, he casually dismissed Fred's attempts to add zero gravity functions to every room, leading Fred to resent him. Roddy later offers advice to [[Hiro Hamada|Hiro]] on how to deal with [[Hardlight (character)|Hardlight]] by sticking to his own strengths rather than imitate Hardlight. After Big Hero 6 rescued [[Chief Cruz]] from Hardlight, Roddy showed the team the entrance to their base.\n\nIn \"[[Portal Enemy]]\", Roddy criticized Hiro for bringing [[Megan Cruz]] to the base, remarking that Boss Awesome would never make such a rookie mistake.\n\nIn \"[[Major Blast]]\", Roddy managed to finish the team's new training simulator. Later, he walks in on the team as they were discussing Major Blast and expressed familiarity, revealing that Boss Awesome kept a floppy disc with Major Blast's identity hidden behind his computer console. Subsequently, Roddy walked in on Fred while he was training to fight Major Blast, yet kept getting distracted. He then recalled that Boss Awesome's weakness was his inability to come up with a clever catchphrase until he turned it into a strength; Fred's only takeaway was that his own catchphrases were far better. At the end of the episode, Roddy, along with the Big Hero 6, witness Fred defeat Major Blast using Roddy's own advice.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* He used to make lairs for both heroes and villains, but stopped for the latter after a villain named Dark Volt \"stiffed [him] on his remodel.\"\n* Roddy helped build Boss Awesome's lair. This is unusual as Roddy appears significantly younger than him.\n\n{{Big Hero 6}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Big Hero 6 characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
