He was first visualized in the [[Skipper Canteen]] restaurant.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Background ===\nDoctor Albert Falls was a scientist, theologian and explorer known for his ability to navigate the remote waters of the rivers of the world and his sense of humor. Among his discoveries were a Sunken Cambodian Temple known to some as the \"Shir Lee Temple\" on June 5, 1888\u00a0and most notably, [[Schweitzer Falls]] and the \"backside of water\" on August 12, 1891.  He had a wife in fellow-adventurer Victoria Marie Falls with him he had a son named Albert Falls, Jr..\n\nIn 1911, he would establish the [[Jungle Navigation Company]], a shipping company he had hoped would improve the way cargo moved up and down remote jungle rivers around the world for his fellow explorers and adventurers. The headquarters of the JNC would also serve as his home, where he would entertain members of the [[Society of Explorers and Adventurers]] in a hidden meeting room located in his library. In fact, he was also a virtuoso pipe organist, known as a Bach interpreter of unique perception and being one of the pioneers of modern historical performance on the pipe organ. \n\nWhen his granddaughter Alberta Falls turned eight, she was sent to live with him, as her father recognized an adventurous spirit in her that would not be content with him traveling on the lecture circuit. Albert and his Skippers would become a second family to her.  In [[1927]], Albert mysteriously disappeared and Alberta would become the new president of the Jungle Navigation Company, starting the first \"Jungle Cruise\" tours in [[1931]].\n\n=== Development History ===\nAlbert Falls was first mentioned in the attraction as a joke: The discoverer and namesake of Schweitzer Falls, the true namesake being Nobel Prize winner [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Schweitzer Albert Schweitzer]. When the Jungle Cruise's backstory was expanded in [[2015]] for the [[Skipper Canteen]], it was decided that he be turned into an actual character and the Jungle Navigation Company's founder.  When the Skipper Canteen first opened, the portrait of him in the waiting area was not quite ready. A placeholder painting was hung on the wall instead, a portrait of a former [[New Jersey]] state governor.\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n===[[Adventure Trading Company]]===\nThe Adventure Trading Company game's \"The Daily Gnus\" newsletter mentioned him as an honoured recipient of the Elephant Juju in 1903\u00a0for his discovery of Schweitzer Falls among other discoveries.\n\n=== [[Club 33]] ===\nIn the menus for the Tiki Takeover event was a 1940 train-ticket for the Missouri Pacific Railway which documented Dr. Falls as travelling from Chicago to Anaheim.\n\n=== Bengal Barbecue ===\nA portrait of Dr. Falls can be seen within a photograph hung within this dining area.  The portrait is in the possession of the characters of Charlie Allnut and Rose Sayer from the [[1945]] film The African Queen.  While being non-Disney, this film was one of the inspirations behind the Jungle Cruise.\n\n=== The Jungle Cruise ===\nThe doctor is mentioned on the attraction when passing by Schweitzer Falls at which point the skipper identifies the water-feature as having been named for the famous Dr. Albert Falls.\n\n=== Magic of Disney Animation ===\nThis area of ''Disney's Hollywood Studios'' featured a section themed to [[Minnie Mouse]]'s Hollywood dressing room.  One of the posters was for a film titled, \"The Jungle Cruise\" which starred herself and Mickey.  On the poster was a crate behind [[Trader Sam]] which had, \"Dr. Albert Falls\" written on it.\n\n=== Skipper Canteen ===\nBooks written by him featured in the Skipper Canteen's library include \"A Small Village With A Large Heart\" and \"Rockefeller, Hippo, Pet, Family\".\n\n=== [[Trader Sam's]] ===\nA bronze bust of Dr. Albert Falls is on a shelf in Trader Sam's Enchanted Tiki Bar at the Disneyland Hotel.\n\n=== [[The Tropical Hideaway]] ===\nDr. Falls is one of the SEA members that have contributed to [[The Tropical Hideaway]]'s wall of expedition paddles, with his coming from a 1903 trip on the Mbei River in Gabon.\n\n== Other Appearances ==\n\n=== Film ===\n\n====[[Jungle Cruise (film)]]====\nIn this film, Dr. Albert Falls is referenced as having gone on a failed expedition to locate the [[Tree of Life]].  From this expedition he stole an arrowhead from the [[Puka Michuna]] tribe that he left in the possession of the misogynistic ''Royal Anthropological and Diverse Adventures Society'' in England of which he was a member.  The Jungle Navigation Company also appears as [[Frank Wolff]]'s company.\n\n=== Printed-Materials ===\n\n==== [[Tales from Adventureland]] ====\nDr. Falls is indirectly referenced in [[Tales from Adventureland: The Golden Paw|''Tales from Adventureland: The Golden Paw'']] through the appearance of Schweitzer Falls which the protagonists' boat plunges over.\n\n=== Video-game ===\n\n==== [[Kinect: Disneyland Adventures]] ====\nThe skipper Al B. Lost brings up Dr. Falls while passing by this game's version of Schweitzer Falls.\n\n== Trivia ==\n\n*Falls dresses in a pith helmet, an item which is considered to be a signature icon of European colonialism.\n*One of [[Melanie Ravenswood|Melanie Ravenswood's]] suitors from [[Phantom Manor]] is named Captain Rowan D. Falls. Judging by his last name and his profession, captain of the [[Mark Twain Riverboat]], he could be a relative or ancestor of Dr. Falls.\n\n== External links ==\n\n* ''[https://junglecruise.fandom.com/wiki/Dr._Albert_Falls?venotify=created Dr. Albert Falls]'' on the ''[https://junglecruise.fandom.com/wiki/Jungle_Cruise_Wiki Jungle Cruise Wiki]''.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nDr Albert Falls Face Character.jpg|A live version of Albert Falls that appeared at the 2016 Destination D event\nSkipper Canteen Sunken Temple.jpg|Painting of a young Albert Falls discovering the Sunken Temple\n</gallery>\n\n{{Jungle Cruise}}\n{{Society of Explorers and Adventurers}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Falls, Albert}}\n[[Category:Theme park characters]]\n[[Category:Society of Explorers and Adventurers]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:Captains]]\n[[Category:Sailors]]\n[[Category:S.E.A. characters]]\n[[Category:Jungle Cruise characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Grandparents]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Presumably Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:English characters]]"
