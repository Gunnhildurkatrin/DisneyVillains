He is [[Todd Daring]]'s best friend who is of Mexican descent (though his shirt has the colors of the flag of Spain). He has a funny looking mouth. He loves mystery books and has a secret talent for singing. He also has a crush on Agent K, and is always trying to win her affections, even after he started dating [[Tasumi]] (though by the end of the episode \"Irreplaceable\", he finally does come to realize K is too old for him).\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"180\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nchar_33887.jpg\nJacoboTasumi15.jpg|Jacobo with Tasumi and Riley\nJacoboTasumi3.png|Jacobo with his girlfriend, Tasumi\nLate Night with Todd and Riley (11).jpg\nLate Night with Todd and Riley (12).jpg\nLate Night with Todd and Riley (15).jpg\n</gallery>\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{The Replacements}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jacobo, Jacobo}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:The Replacements characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]"
