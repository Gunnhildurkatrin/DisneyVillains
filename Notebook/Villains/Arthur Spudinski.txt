He is extremely loyal, and will do anything to help them. Although seemingly slow-witted, he often comes up with intelligent things to say at random times, much like the [[Scarecrow (Wizard of Oz)|Scarecrow]] in ''The Wizard of Oz.'' He's actually a genius but tries to hide it<ref name=\"mind\">[[A Befuddled Mind]]</ref> in order to live an easier and carefree life. Spud has a tremendous fear of clowns that started when he was five years old.<ref>[[Half Baked]]</ref> He also has an obsession with mermaids and dreams of becoming a \"merman\".<ref name=\"home\">[[Homecoming]]</ref>\n\n===Abilities===\nIn Season 1, Spud doesn't appear to be particularly smart and often spends his time goofing around and making a fool of himself. It's only at the beginning of Season 2 that Spud shows a very comprehensive technological knowledge. He owns a laptop computer that sports surveillance capabilities and other advanced functions.\n\nSpud used his computer to decode the encryption in the [[The Huntsclan|Huntsclan]] teleportation system, allowing his friends and him to intercept the teleportation of [[Huntsboys 88 and 89|Huntsboys Numbers 88 and 89]] (the same episode shows Spud's father as an uptight intellectual whom Spud resents, perhaps explaining his current \"slacker\" attitude).<ref>[[The Academy]]</ref> He once developed a global-positioning device to track his cheerleader crush, [[Stacey Wintergrin|Stacey]].<ref name=\"on\">[[Bring It On]]</ref>\n\nIt is revealed that Spud is, in fact, a genius, and scored a perfect mark on a government-issued standardized test, which was a first for [[Millard Fillmore Middle School]]. Despite this, Spud generally prefers not to use his genius IQ, as he fears that upon the discovery of his intelligence, the ensuing pressure would not allow him to enjoy his life.<ref name=\"mind\">[[A Befuddled Mind]]</ref>\n\nThroughout the series, there have been several hints that Spud may possess a magical background. Spud mentioned that his great-grandfather used to be a magician, albeit apparently not a very good one. During the talent show in which he does a magician act in honor of his relative, Spud unknowingly uses a magical incantation thought to have been lost for centuries to seal a Djinn away; it is, in fact, the catch-phrase his 'super gramps' taught him when he was younger.<ref name=\"long\">[[The Talented Mr. Long]]</ref>\n\nThe Gorgon sisters remark about how Spud is the spitting image of the warrior Perseus, who originally sealed them away. However, this might be entirely due to the Spartacus costume for the Fighting Trojans mascot he was wearing at the time and does not necessarily mean he is related to the ancient hero.<ref name=\"on\">[[Bring it On (American Dragon: Jake Long)]]</ref>\n\nSpud also mentions his family's tales of a mermaid city in the East River.<ref>[[Something Fishy This Way Comes]]</ref>\n\nIt is interesting to note that Spud himself appears to have a relation with magic that may hint to a magical background. For example, he has displayed mastery with the use of two magical wands while battling Pandarus<ref name=\"mind\">[[A Befuddled Mind]]</ref> without any instructions or training beforehand, though he had trouble remembering what the spells would do. Spud once maximized the smell of onion, using a powerful voice, to defeat one of the giant bugs in the principal's room that [[Sigmund Brock]] sent.<ref>[[The Rotwood Files]]</ref> He also gains magical frog-like powers in one episode,<ref>[[Shaggy Frog]]</ref> although he goes back to being human with no magical abilities at all in the end.\n\n==Relationships==\n===[[Jake Long]]===\nJake and Spud are like brothers. Both care about each other's well being, which is demonstrated multiple times. Spud wants to be a dragon-like Jake and is jealous of his dragon abilities and sometimes they argue, but not seriously. After all, everyone argues with their friends. But in the end, they both know they need each other to help protect the magical world.\n\n===[[Trixie Carter]]===\nSpud and Trixie are very good and firm friends. They know each other very well and are a solid team together. However, at this stage of their relationship, friendship is all they are. The mistaken prospect of their predicted marriage truly upset them,<ref name=\"duty\">[[Body Guard Duty]]</ref> and they later reconfirmed there was nothing ''deeper'' to their mutual feelings toward each other.<ref name=\"home\">[[Homecoming]]</ref>\n\n===[[Stacey Wintergrin]]===\n[[File:Spud and Stacey.jpg|thumb|250px]]\nOther than this, Spud later shows an obsession toward a cheerleader named [[Stacey Wintergrin]]. His fixation on her is so great that he even goes as far as to create a global positioning device to track her. He develops several plans and ploys in order to win her love but is constantly rejected by her no matter what he does to attract her attention.\n\nHowever, Stacey finally develops feelings for Spud, though Spud thinks it's because of the deal he made with the Gorgon [[Fury Gorgon|Fury]].<ref name=\"jeal\">[[Furious Jealousy]]</ref> It is soon revealed that Spud did, in fact, win over her heart on his own and that magic had nothing to do with it. They seem to start dating at this point, though Stacey insists they cannot be seen together, or else her reputation would be ruined.\n\nSpud later became Stacey's graduation partner.<ref name=\"being\">[[Being Human]]</ref> From this it is believed that they are most likely officially dating and that their relationship has become more public.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallerylink}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the Season One intro, Spud plays the drums in Jake's imaginary band.\n*Spud's magician name is \"Spud the Spudnificient\".<ref name=\"long\"/>\n*In one episode,<ref>\"[[Dreamscape]]\"</ref> Spud dreams of being Spudman, the hero of Spudopolis. His catchphrase is: \"Tally-ho!\"\n**Spud's world is a parody of ''Batman'' and ''Superman'' mixed together.\n*During the beginning of Season Two's next-to-last episode,<ref name=\"being\">[[Being Human]]</ref> Spud sings the first few lyrics of the show's intro.\n*In Season Two, Spud wears an alien head logo shirt.\n*In the ''[[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|Lilo & Stitch]]'' franchise, specifically in ''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]'' in which Spud and other ''American Dragon'' characters appear in [[Morpholomew (episode)|one episode]], Spud is the only character who originates outside of that franchise to name one of [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba's]] [[Experiments|genetic experiments]], naming Experiment 316 \"[[Morpholomew]]\".\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{American Dragon: Jake Long}}\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Spudinski, Arthur}}\n[[Category:American Dragon: Jake Long characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Teenagers]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Lovers]]\n[[Category:Characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Superheroes]]\n[[Category:Spies]]\n[[Category:Chefs]]\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Singing characters]]\n[[Category:Students]]\n[[Category:Characters who break the Fourth Wall]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel characters]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]"
