When the tourists see the fire and start to panic, Jammer and the Secretary evacuate the cars, while Pulaski evacuates the planes.\n\nJammer, Pulaski, and the Secretary are seen at the main road exit, helping the tourists evacuate, when a tree catches on fire and falls on the exit, blocking it, with no other way out. Luckily, [[Windlifter]], [[Dusty Crophopper]], and [[Lil' Dipper]] drop their retardant on the fires, extinguishing them, while the [[Smokejumpers]] parachute out of [[Cabbie]] and remove the debris, allowing the tourists to proceed.\n\nFive days later, Jammer and Pulaski arrive at the firefighters' base,\u00a0with\u00a0Jammer stating that Dusty had he and Pulaski worried and they are glad that Dusty is all right, however, Dusty is surprised to hear that Jammer is the park's new superintendent.
