In \"Romeo and Juliet\", Cissy manages to get the role of Juliet in the school's production of the famous Shakespearean play, despite only knowing of the existence of the film. She is unable to keep the part as she loses a contact lens and she can never read the teleprompter.\n\nIn \"[[The Finale]]\", it is established that in the series' version of [[2013]], Cissy starts working at a boutique. Despite her rather simplistic future, she is very happy as she is around the things that she likes. She has apparently kept tabs on her middle school friends.\n\n==Episode Appearances==\n*\"[[Ziterella]]\"\n*\"[[Romeo and Juliet]]\"\n*\"[[The Big Pencil]]\"\n*\"[[Uniform, Uniformity]]\"\n*\"[[Snot Your Mother's Music]]\"\n*\"[[The Environ-Mentals]]\"\n*\"[[Crush and Burn]]\"\n*\"[[Soccer Season]]\"\n*\"[[Hazelnut's Finest]]\"\n*\"[[Vanessa Less Tessa]]\"\n*\"[[Peer Counselor P.A.]]\"\n*\"[[A 'Tween Halloween]]\"\n*\"[[Presenting Stewart Waldinger]]\"\n*\"[[Pepper Ann's Life in a Nutshell]]\"\n*\"[[Like Riding a Bike]]\"\n*\"[[Radio Freak Hazelnut]]\n*\"[[Framed (Pepper Ann)|Framed]]\"\n*\"[[You Oughta Be in Musicals!]]\"\n*\"[[The Wash-Out]]\"\n*\"[[A Kosher Christmas]]\"\n*\"[[Burn Hazelnut Burn]]\"\n*\"[[Flaw and Order]]\"\n*\"[[The Velvet Room]]\"\n*\"[[One Angry Woman]]\"\n*\"[[The Telltale Fuzzy]]\"\n*\"[[Permanent Record]]\"\n*\"[[Live and Let Dye]]\"\n*\"[[To Germany with Love]]\"\n*\"[[Bye, Bye Trinket]]\"\n*\"[[The Amazing Becky Little]]\"\n*\"[[The Way They Were]]\"\n*\"[[Too Cool to Be Mom]]\"\n*\"[[The Finale]]\"\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" widths=\"150\" captionalign=\"center\">\nPepper Ann Cissy.jpg\nA 'Tween Halloween (1).jpg\nA 'Tween Halloween.jpg\nA 'Tween Halloween (3).jpg\nToo Cool to be Mom.jpg\nToo Cool to be Mom (4).jpg\nToo Cool to be Mom (3).jpg\nZiterella (1).jpg\nPresenting Stewart Waldinger.jpg\nPresenting Stewart Waldinger (1).jpg\nPresenting Stewart Waldinger (2).jpg\nLike Riding a Bike.jpg\nCissy.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{CharacterStub}}\n{{Pepper Ann}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rooney, Cissy}}\n[[Category:Pepper Ann characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:TV Animation characters]]\n[[Category:Pre-teens]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:American characters]]\n[[Category:Cheerleaders]]\n[[Category:Heroines]]\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Students]]"
