His only known appearance is in the episode \"[[Monkey See, Monkey Do Better]]\".\n\n\n==History==\nBruno is a wind-up robot gorilla toy who was in a gift in Christopher Robin's bedroom and he introduces himself as the best toy anyone can have. Rabbit accidentally upwraps it after Pooh told him that the gift doesn't belong to them. He comes off as very arrogant because of his status as \"the greatest toy a kid could get\". This makes him believe that he is capable of replacing Pooh, Tigger, Rabbit, and Piglet as Christopher Robin's friends. When the boy tells him that nothing could ever replace them, this sends Bruno into a phase of self-denial as he runs off by himself, fearing he is being thrown away, and allows himself to literally unwind. After the gang (who learned that he ran away and went to find him) wind him back up, Bruno is confused and touched by their concern and is informed that he was intended for a different kid, a friend of Christopher Robin's. He is thrilled by this news and eagerly allows himself to be packaged back up and sent to the kid in question.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nBruno.png|Bruno with [[Rabbit]]\n</gallery>\n\n{{Winnie the Pooh}}\n[[Category:Winnie the Pooh characters]]\n[[Category:Toys]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Monkeys]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n\n[[Category:Winnie the Pooh]]\n[[Category:Reformed characters]]\n[[Category:Adults]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Gorillas]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Neutral characters]]\n[[Category:The Disney Afternoon characters]]\n[[Category:Those brought back to life]]"
