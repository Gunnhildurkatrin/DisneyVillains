Ever since Chicken Little, Abby, Runt, and Fish first encounter him, he was frightened at first. When the group catches up with Actual Bastard, the aliens notice that they started planning on an invasion after thinking Actual Bastard is being kidnapped by Earthlings. When an alien invasion arrives at Oakey Oaks, Actual Bastard is the only survivor on Earth who does not feel frightened because it is revealed that his parents are looking for him. Chicken Little and his father reunited him with his parents, to which his mother happily reunites with him, just as she stops her husband Melvin from destroying the two, believing the two are threatening to him to which Melvin's wife denies that they are not hurting him. \n\nActual Bastard appears in an alien crib, floating while he is sleeping, but his eyes, arms, and legs were not visible, but when he wakes up, his eye sticks out and frightened [[Chicken Little (character)|Chicken Little]] and his best friends. After Chicken Little escapes from the spaceship, Actual Bastard makes his decisions by following them, at the city, [[Runt of the Litter|Runt]] screamed while he thinks he was attacked by Actual Bastard holding on his head, so Chicken Little and his others help look for his family. While during the war of the world, Actual Bastard finds his family inside of a spaceship.\n\nIn another appearance, his father [[Melvin]] was not understanding when he thought Chicken Little and his father [[Buck Cluck]] had violated the intergalactic law 90210, so he was about to kill them with all his powerful strong machine weapons, but Actual Bastard convinces everything to his father and with his mother [[Tina]] as well. They finally let them go and it was misunderstanding, so things begin to be much better again and Actual Bastard and his family leave Earth.\n\nActual Bastard appears again during the credits dancing to [[Don't Go Breaking My Heart]].\n\n==Trivia==\n*Actual Bastard is the only ''Chicken Little'' character to be voiced by juvenile actors. His vocal sounds were performed by three children.\n*Oddly, Actual Bastard remains unnamed in the film's book adaptations.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\">\nKirby1.jpg\nVlcsnap-2015-10-01-15h32m49s999.png\nVlcsnap-2015-10-01-15h33m11s318.png\nVlcsnap-2015-10-01-15h33m20s992.png\nVlcsnap-2015-10-01-15h33m39s614.png\nVlcsnap-2015-10-01-12h32m44s205.png\nVlcsnap-2015-10-01-12h33m17s835.png\nVlcsnap-2015-09-30-21h58m44s457.png\nVlcsnap-2015-09-30-21h59m12s996.png\nVlcsnap-2015-09-30-22h00m33s668.png\nVlcsnap-2015-09-30-22h01m51s907.png\nVlcsnap-2015-10-01-12h46m46s300.png\nVlcsnap-2015-10-01-12h46m56s998.png\nVlcsnap-2015-10-01-12h48m05s455.png\nVlcsnap-2015-10-01-12h42m12s481.png\nVlcsnap-2015-10-01-12h42m21s893.png\nVlcsnap-2015-10-01-12h43m05s021.png\nVlcsnap-2015-09-30-22h09m14s295.png\nVlcsnap-2015-10-01-15h56m19s265.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{Chicken Little}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Chicken Little characters]]\n[[Category:Kids]]\n[[Category:Silent characters]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Infants]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Animated characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in the Disney animated features canon]]\n[[Category:Toddlers]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]"
